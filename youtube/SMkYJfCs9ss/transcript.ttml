<p begin="00:00:28.170" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">just a few words about your economics</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:34.829" style="s2">department G mu and particularly how it</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:37.500" style="s2">might be different from other economics</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.500" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">economics here at George Mason and our</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">department is a little unusual</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:47.399" style="s2">contrarians which has some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.329" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">features because new contrarians really</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.660" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">high method and more on a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:58.590" style="s2">range of interesting questions and so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">also tend to be more publicly engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.590" end="00:01:01.800" style="s2">having blogs and books that are widely</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">read and that sort of thing well that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.800" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">sounds real good and certainly you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">you and I have known each other at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:10.220" style="s2">a little bit for a few years and your</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:12.360" style="s2">range of interests is quite astounding</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.220" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">but when I was looking at your research</p>

<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">cook this down to 90 minutes I usually</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.710" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">have to apologize for that which I kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:23.159" style="s2">of still should although there&#39;s this</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">that says more about someone like you or</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">me than it does by 20 year old okay I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">think that&#39;s probably right anyway let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">hop in last night my wife and I watched</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">on Black Mirror the episode Rachael Jack</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:53.369" style="s2">and Ashley - you recently tweeted about</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">that and I think you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.369" end="00:01:56.729" style="s2">they&#39;d actually chatted with you a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:02:00.659" style="s2">little bit about it and you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.729" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">entirely happy with the result I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.659" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">no contact with Black Mirror peoples at</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">all so as far as I know they I have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">indication they are aware of me at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">or any of my writings on the subject so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:14.670" style="s2">I have this book called the age of M</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">which is a serious attempt to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.670" end="00:02:18.660" style="s2">what happens when you do brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:20.459" style="s2">emulations and about a third of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.660" end="00:02:23.160" style="s2">black mayor episodes have included</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.459" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">branding relations which i think is you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.160" end="00:02:27.910" style="s2">know saying that the concept is potent</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">interesting but when they use brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.910" end="00:02:32.980" style="s2">emulations in their stories they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:34.630" style="s2">do it at all in a realistic way that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.980" end="00:02:36.280" style="s2">brain emulations would radically change</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.630" end="00:02:38.320" style="s2">most everything it would be this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.280" end="00:02:39.640" style="s2">enormous disruption of society on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.320" end="00:02:41.470" style="s2">scale of say the Industrial Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.640" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">or even the farming revolution but they</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.470" end="00:02:45.820" style="s2">usually have an emulation there just for</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:48.580" style="s2">one little thing that is the world is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:49.870" style="s2">mostly familiar except one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.580" end="00:02:51.790" style="s2">different because there&#39;s an EM and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.870" end="00:02:54.220" style="s2">that&#39;s this doesn&#39;t make much sense so</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.790" end="00:02:57.070" style="s2">in that particular episode there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.220" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">singer and in order to get more fans</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.070" end="00:03:00.520" style="s2">engaged with her they make a brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:02.830" style="s2">emulation of her that they sell to our</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.520" end="00:03:04.750" style="s2">fans and you as a fan can talk to an</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.830" end="00:03:06.190" style="s2">emulation of the singer and chat with it</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.750" end="00:03:08.500" style="s2">and it can help you you know do your</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.190" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">hair and your clothing and you know be</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.500" end="00:03:13.300" style="s2">friends which if emulations were</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:14.950" style="s2">possible isn&#39;t a crazy thing to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:18.070" style="s2">just crazy to have a world where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.950" end="00:03:20.200" style="s2">the only thing they do because basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.070" end="00:03:22.870" style="s2">atoms could replace everybody on all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.200" end="00:03:24.730" style="s2">jobs once Em&#39;s are cheap enough to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.870" end="00:03:27.430" style="s2">that well they&#39;re cheap enough to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.730" end="00:03:29.470" style="s2">everything yep I read the age of em when</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.430" end="00:03:31.239" style="s2">it came out and was quite taken with it</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.470" end="00:03:34.030" style="s2">and when you agree to be a guest I went</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.239" end="00:03:35.980" style="s2">back and reviewed it went through at</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.030" end="00:03:38.140" style="s2">high speed but reminded myself of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.980" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">number of interesting things and I must</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.140" end="00:03:42.250" style="s2">say as someone who&#39;s known a number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">futurists and have read a number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.250" end="00:03:49.690" style="s2">futurists scenarios it is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:52.660" style="s2">richest most integrated futurist</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.690" end="00:03:54.820" style="s2">scenario I&#39;ve ever seen as you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.660" end="00:03:56.590" style="s2">Robin indicated his assumptions at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.820" end="00:03:59.709" style="s2">broadest level is that we developed this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.590" end="00:04:01.570" style="s2">technology to upload a human into to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.709" end="00:04:04.870" style="s2">upload humans and turn them into robots</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.570" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">essentially and it very quickly becomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.870" end="00:04:09.640" style="s2">the basis of our whole civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">maybe you can speak relatively briefly</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.640" end="00:04:13.269" style="s2">about the various things that that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:16.540" style="s2">big that are happening that you see</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.269" end="00:04:18.549" style="s2">after this sure now I like to say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.540" end="00:04:20.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like science fiction except there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.549" end="00:04:23.110" style="s2">no plot and there&#39;s no characters and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.380" end="00:04:24.640" style="s2">all makes sense a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.110" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">told me over the years a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.640" end="00:04:28.060" style="s2">Technology people especially it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:30.070" style="s2">while it&#39;s possible to envision future</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.060" end="00:04:32.350" style="s2">technologies it&#39;s just not possible to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.070" end="00:04:34.060" style="s2">see their social consequences and if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.350" end="00:04:35.500" style="s2">read a fair number of futurists you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.060" end="00:04:37.479" style="s2">might tend to agree with that because</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.500" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">futurists often seem to have pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.479" end="00:04:40.650" style="s2">vague and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:42.810" style="s2">in substantial forecasts so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.650" end="00:04:44.219" style="s2">show in this book that you really could</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.810" end="00:04:46.020" style="s2">say a lot about a concrete scenario if</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.219" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">you worked it out carefully this</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.020" end="00:04:49.740" style="s2">scenario is where you can scan a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.659" style="s2">individual human brain and make a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.740" end="00:04:53.879" style="s2">computer model of that and run that on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.659" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">computer and that model has the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.879" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">input-output behavior that is it acts</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:04:59.310" style="s2">the same in the same situation you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">hook it up with artificial eyes ears</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.310" end="00:05:03.870" style="s2">hands and mouth and then it could talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:05.580" style="s2">back to you you could do jobs etc so</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.870" end="00:05:07.319" style="s2">once you have emulations and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.580" end="00:05:08.370" style="s2">cheap then they are cheaper than human</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.319" end="00:05:09.930" style="s2">workers and they can do pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.370" end="00:05:12.509" style="s2">anything a human can do because they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.930" end="00:05:15.270" style="s2">emulations of humans and so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.509" end="00:05:15.599" style="s2">all the humans lose their jobs and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.270" end="00:05:17.879" style="s2">m&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.599" end="00:05:20.370" style="s2">take the jobs but a lot more things</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.879" end="00:05:22.259" style="s2">happen so the MS can be made in</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.370" end="00:05:23.580" style="s2">factories as fast as you can crank them</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.259" end="00:05:25.379" style="s2">out which is very different from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:27.300" style="s2">human population so the population of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.379" end="00:05:29.699" style="s2">Em&#39;s can explode and the population gets</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.300" end="00:05:31.500" style="s2">so large that it drives down wages to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.699" end="00:05:32.969" style="s2">near subsistence levels which is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.500" end="00:05:34.379" style="s2">level at which human wages have</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.969" end="00:05:36.659" style="s2">typically been in most of human history</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.379" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">and for most animals in history that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.659" end="00:05:41.009" style="s2">also the kind of life they live and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:43.409" style="s2">Em&#39;s have to work most of the time in a</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.409" end="00:05:46.889" style="s2">number of Em&#39;s can grow so fast the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.940" end="00:05:48.839" style="s2">economy can grow much faster the ability</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.889" end="00:05:50.490" style="s2">to grow humans is a big limit on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.839" end="00:05:52.349" style="s2">current growth rate of the economy so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:53.940" style="s2">estimate roughly that this new Emme</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.349" end="00:05:55.800" style="s2">economy could double roughly every month</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.940" end="00:05:58.770" style="s2">rather than the doubling every 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.800" end="00:06:01.349" style="s2">we have at the moment these M&#39;s 2 big</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.770" end="00:06:04.319" style="s2">features of them is they can make copies</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.349" end="00:06:06.449" style="s2">of themselves and they can change their</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.319" end="00:06:07.860" style="s2">speeds so since they&#39;re running on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.449" end="00:06:09.509" style="s2">computer if you and in there a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.860" end="00:06:11.339" style="s2">parallel process if you give them more</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.509" end="00:06:13.889" style="s2">processors they can run that process</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.339" end="00:06:15.930" style="s2">faster so subjectively they can run</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.889" end="00:06:18.029" style="s2">faster or slower than human speed if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.930" end="00:06:19.889" style="s2">pay more to go faster and so my best</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.029" end="00:06:21.479" style="s2">estimate is they run roughly a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.889" end="00:06:23.669" style="s2">times human speed the typical M does</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.479" end="00:06:25.229" style="s2">that&#39;s a speed at which in the one month</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.669" end="00:06:26.939" style="s2">doubling time of the economy they</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.229" end="00:06:28.889" style="s2">experience a subjective century and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.939" end="00:06:30.360" style="s2">roughly after that point they need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.889" end="00:06:32.129" style="s2">retire because their minds will become</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.360" end="00:06:34.409" style="s2">too fragile to be competitive with</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.129" end="00:06:36.330" style="s2">younger workers and because it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.409" end="00:06:37.710" style="s2">make copies of thems than most M&#39;s are</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.550" end="00:06:44.939" style="s2">be scanned to become emulations and</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.850" end="00:07:39.510" style="s2">it yeah let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.140" end="00:07:42.600" style="s2">first you know your ballpark estimate</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.510" end="00:07:45.240" style="s2">for Em&#39;s was about a hundred years and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.600" end="00:07:48.170" style="s2">you laid out I thought some reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.240" end="00:07:51.030" style="s2">good analysis and why that was not</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.170" end="00:07:53.610" style="s2">unreasonable yes I would say my estimate</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.030" end="00:07:56.010" style="s2">is shorter than that for other</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.610" end="00:07:57.900" style="s2">approaches but I&#39;ll confess my</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.010" end="00:08:00.120" style="s2">methodology is more seat-of-the-pants</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.900" end="00:08:02.190" style="s2">and less analytic than yours but if I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.120" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">had to put a flag down I&#39;d say 20 to 80</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.190" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">years with a somewhat skewed mean of 50</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:10.590" style="s2">and if we got there in 50 before your</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.930" style="s2">M&#39;s got there in 100 I think there would</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.590" end="00:08:15.450" style="s2">be no point in doing m&#39;s or very little</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.930" end="00:08:17.940" style="s2">and here&#39;s why m&#39;s aren&#39;t very good</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.450" end="00:08:19.950" style="s2">right they&#39;re only a bit better than</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.940" end="00:08:22.020" style="s2">humans and one of the things I like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.950" end="00:08:23.370" style="s2">say about humans and I usually just say</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.020" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">it because it sounded good which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.370" end="00:08:27.990" style="s2">humans are to the first order the</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.990" end="00:08:33.840" style="s2">right my nature is seldom profligate in</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.840" end="00:08:38.729" style="s2">to do to get an advantage or species</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.270" end="00:08:40.229" style="s2">that&#39;s course is all teleological talk</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:44.250" style="s2">nonetheless you get the point that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.030" end="00:08:45.840" style="s2">humans aren&#39;t that smart well in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.250" end="00:08:48.210" style="s2">last five years I spent a good amount of</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.490" end="00:13:38.529" style="s2">there&#39;s this number of separate</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.230" end="00:13:41.020" style="s2">questions here one issue is how far can</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.529" end="00:13:43.540" style="s2">other things get before em show up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.020" end="00:13:45.910" style="s2">the separate issue is when both of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.540" end="00:13:48.100" style="s2">are around which wins the competition or</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.910" end="00:13:49.810" style="s2">which wins where and those are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.100" end="00:13:51.550" style="s2">separate issues that are related with</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.810" end="00:13:54.610" style="s2">respect to the first question a key</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.550" end="00:13:57.400" style="s2">issue is just how hard is AGI and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.610" end="00:13:59.020" style="s2">hard are emulations so if you think as</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.400" end="00:14:01.779" style="s2">many people do that there&#39;s some you</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.020" end="00:14:04.029" style="s2">know essential five line theory and once</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.779" end="00:14:05.500" style="s2">you find that theory then you&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.029" end="00:14:07.810" style="s2">and you can do basically everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.500" end="00:14:08.920" style="s2">relatively easy then you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.810" end="00:14:11.200" style="s2">wondering when we&#39;re gonna find that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.920" end="00:14:14.710" style="s2">theory but if you think of you know AGI</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.200" end="00:14:18.130" style="s2">is just a name for a huge pool of tools</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.710" end="00:14:19.990" style="s2">and a huge pile of capabilities that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.130" end="00:14:22.390" style="s2">only way to achieve it is to slowly add</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.990" end="00:14:24.910" style="s2">to the pile then the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.390" end="00:14:27.430" style="s2">how big is the pile and how fast are we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.910" end="00:14:29.350" style="s2">going so I tend to be skeptical about</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.430" end="00:14:31.450" style="s2">the one big revolution that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.350" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">change everything we really haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.450" end="00:14:36.130" style="s2">that in the last 70 years say of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.740" style="s2">computer progress computer progress has</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.130" end="00:14:40.300" style="s2">been lumpy sometimes but the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.740" end="00:14:42.459" style="s2">lumpiness and computer progress is</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.300" end="00:14:45.010" style="s2">comparable to other fields and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.459" end="00:14:46.690" style="s2">we see a relatively universal pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.010" end="00:14:48.520" style="s2">the lumpiness of research in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.690" end="00:14:50.650" style="s2">citations actually and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.520" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">this straight forward prediction for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.650" end="00:14:54.130" style="s2">future is a continued rate of progress</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">at the rate we&#39;ve seen over the last 70</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.130" end="00:14:59.050" style="s2">years and at that rate it should take a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:01.540" style="s2">really long time so 50 years would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.050" end="00:15:03.610" style="s2">pretty ambitious you think you said 400</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.540" end="00:15:05.589" style="s2">was kind of the center of your guess you</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.610" end="00:15:07.959" style="s2">still feel comfortable that I would say</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.589" end="00:15:10.270" style="s2">one statistic III uses is that I&#39;d ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.959" end="00:15:12.550" style="s2">people in the last 20 years how far have</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.270" end="00:15:14.230" style="s2">we come in your subfield of AI as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.550" end="00:15:15.790" style="s2">percentage of how far we need to go to</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.230" end="00:15:17.980" style="s2">get to my level abilities and and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.790" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">median response I got was about five to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.980" end="00:15:20.589" style="s2">ten percent with no noticeable</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:22.029" style="s2">accelerations so if you project that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.589" end="00:15:23.410" style="s2">forward you&#39;ve got two to four centuries</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.029" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.410" end="00:15:27.550" style="s2">in principle of em&#39;s took longer than</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:30.220" style="s2">that then that&#39;s how far you get but</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.550" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">still the question is I agree that m&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.220" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">are all or nothing and therefore less</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:36.550" style="s2">likely to produce a burst</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:38.709" style="s2">investment to try to produce it of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.550" end="00:15:40.329" style="s2">course Adi really isn&#39;t gonna produce a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.709" end="00:15:42.220" style="s2">burst of investment to produce AGI it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.329" end="00:15:44.379" style="s2">mostly going to be investment along the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:46.660" style="s2">path of particular products and services</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.379" end="00:15:48.550" style="s2">that will be useful well before AGI and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.660" end="00:15:49.959" style="s2">similarly for him most of the work is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.550" end="00:15:51.189" style="s2">gonna be on the technology that will</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.959" end="00:15:53.079" style="s2">eventually lead to Emma&#39;s but not</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.189" end="00:15:54.670" style="s2">because it will lead to ms it&#39;ll be for</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.079" end="00:15:56.889" style="s2">other purposes although it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.670" end="00:15:59.019" style="s2">noting that many people in especially in</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.889" end="00:16:01.839" style="s2">science fiction focus on the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.019" end="00:16:03.459" style="s2">MMS as immortality and the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.839" end="00:16:05.259" style="s2">Em&#39;s from that point of view as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.459" end="00:16:07.240" style="s2">product is you could become an emulation</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.259" end="00:16:08.500" style="s2">and then you&#39;d be a more you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.240" end="00:16:10.089" style="s2">think that&#39;s actually an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.500" end="00:16:12.790" style="s2">argument which one I probably have been</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.089" end="00:16:14.889" style="s2">considered enough and we know humans are</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.790" end="00:16:17.589" style="s2">vain and we also know how much of human</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.889" end="00:16:19.779" style="s2">history has been driven by in my view</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.589" end="00:16:23.110" style="s2">false promises of immortality in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.779" end="00:16:25.529" style="s2">afterlife so it is it is possible I will</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.110" end="00:16:28.089" style="s2">acknowledge that that&#39;s actually a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.529" end="00:16:30.189" style="s2">response with respect to and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.089" end="00:16:33.550" style="s2">investment ecosystem that if they get</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.189" end="00:16:35.610" style="s2">close enough then there might be a spur</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.550" end="00:16:38.350" style="s2">of investment around the immortality</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.610" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">marketplace right so if this high level</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.350" end="00:16:42.910" style="s2">of the my two kinds of arguments would</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:44.980" style="s2">be to say look AGI is just really hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.910" end="00:16:46.449" style="s2">and so it&#39;s gonna take a long time where</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.980" end="00:16:47.829" style="s2">there isn&#39;t gonna be this moment where</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.449" end="00:16:51.399" style="s2">we suddenly figure it out and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.829" end="00:16:53.110" style="s2">all done it&#39;s just a long slog MSR also</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.399" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">in some sense a long slog but in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.110" end="00:16:56.939" style="s2">sense MSR more just scaling up things we</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:59.110" style="s2">kind of know how to do it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.939" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">fundamental new understandings you need</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.110" end="00:17:03.339" style="s2">four M&#39;s than just increasing scale so</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:05.169" style="s2">you have to have bigger scale scans you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.339" end="00:17:07.449" style="s2">have to have bigger cheaper computers</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.169" end="00:17:09.939" style="s2">and you have to have more brain cell</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.449" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">models you know one actually what item I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.939" end="00:17:13.659" style="s2">when I was pondering instant I think you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:15.730" style="s2">addressed it in passing on how much</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.659" end="00:17:19.000" style="s2">detail a little bit is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.730" end="00:17:21.069" style="s2">questions about how doable M is is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.000" end="00:17:23.500" style="s2">what level the details matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.069" end="00:17:27.159" style="s2">right yeah if the details matter at</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.890" end="00:17:53.900" style="s2">the brain is a signal processing system</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.320" end="00:17:56.180" style="s2">an in general signal processing system</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.550" end="00:18:45.680" style="s2">she&#39;s an evolution machine and and as we</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.400" end="00:18:47.570" style="s2">know does all kinds of crazy weird</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.680" end="00:18:50.600" style="s2">things that are highly dependent upon</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.570" end="00:18:53.420" style="s2">each other between levels and things so</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.600" end="00:18:55.700" style="s2">I would expect us to find some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.420" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">separation there if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.700" end="00:18:59.470" style="s2">organization body say just organs</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.130" style="s2">themselves also follow this principle</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.470" end="00:19:03.290" style="s2">but you know there are different</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.130" end="00:19:04.490" style="s2">subsystems inside of organism and those</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.290" end="00:19:06.650" style="s2">different subsystems have different</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.490" end="00:19:08.360" style="s2">purposes and in order to best design</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.650" end="00:19:09.890" style="s2">each subsystem usually you try to make</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.360" end="00:19:11.800" style="s2">the subsystems we saw independent of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.890" end="00:19:15.080" style="s2">other subsystems and they roughly are</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.800" end="00:19:18.800" style="s2">indeed roughly but if you change small</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.080" end="00:19:21.170" style="s2">things in the metabolomic a ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.800" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">graph it all fails right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.170" end="00:19:24.410" style="s2">lot more cross linkage than a decent</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">engineer would do but I take your point</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.410" end="00:19:29.060" style="s2">there certainly some how about the Third</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:31.190" style="s2">Point that suppose the to arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.060" end="00:19:33.050" style="s2">similar times let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.190" end="00:19:36.050" style="s2">competition a little bit alright so</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.050" end="00:19:37.190" style="s2">imagine that m&#39;s come when AI hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.050" end="00:19:39.560" style="s2">taken over everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.190" end="00:19:42.560" style="s2">maybe I isn&#39;t better at everything and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.560" end="00:19:44.450" style="s2">so then the key question is now they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.560" end="00:19:47.240" style="s2">compete on equal terms in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.450" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">hardware and investment and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.240" end="00:19:51.680" style="s2">capitalist attention and it&#39;s more now</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">the question of which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.680" end="00:19:55.580" style="s2">architecture is better suited for which</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:57.680" style="s2">kind of problems and so this comes to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.580" end="00:19:59.149" style="s2">your architectural criticisms you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.680" end="00:20:00.919" style="s2">you could say well look</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.149" end="00:20:03.799" style="s2">our architectures aren&#39;t perfect they</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.919" end="00:20:05.479" style="s2">are have flaws but then you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.799" end="00:20:07.849" style="s2">improve them so obviously humans have</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.479" end="00:20:10.009" style="s2">improved their working memory say by you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.849" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">know having external memory records</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.009" end="00:20:14.149" style="s2">videos audio recordings things like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:16.099" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s also a more</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.149" end="00:20:18.229" style="s2">accurate memory so the real question is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.099" end="00:20:21.139" style="s2">these different architectural systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.229" end="00:20:23.899" style="s2">and approaches which have the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.139" end="00:20:26.539" style="s2">of flexibility or evolved ability or</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.899" end="00:20:28.849" style="s2">change ability and what other advantages</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.539" end="00:20:30.499" style="s2">do they have so that some wins somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.849" end="00:20:33.289" style="s2">in some things another so as long as</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.499" end="00:20:35.389" style="s2">Em&#39;s win in some substantial fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.289" end="00:20:36.979" style="s2">job tasks they don&#39;t have to win</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.389" end="00:20:39.379" style="s2">everywhere then something like the age</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.979" end="00:20:41.929" style="s2">of them happens that is in the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.379" end="00:20:44.479" style="s2">where the MS are best then the age of M</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.929" end="00:20:46.309" style="s2">dis scenario happens in those job tasks</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.479" end="00:20:47.599" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a whole other world of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.309" end="00:20:49.219" style="s2">tasks that are done by other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.599" end="00:20:50.899" style="s2">automation and the age of M isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.219" end="00:20:52.489" style="s2">talking so much about that but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.899" end="00:20:54.469" style="s2">should imagine it that this implicit</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.489" end="00:20:57.049" style="s2">huge background of hardware and software</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.469" end="00:20:58.429" style="s2">that&#39;s doing other tasks would exist in</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.049" end="00:21:00.469" style="s2">that world and wouldn&#39;t change that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.429" end="00:21:02.419" style="s2">world enormously the description would</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.469" end="00:21:04.909" style="s2">be roughly the same so it comes down to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.419" end="00:21:07.759" style="s2">then and as many people think that in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.909" end="00:21:09.229" style="s2">fact M sort of brain organization kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.759" end="00:21:11.210" style="s2">of software just loses it everything and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.229" end="00:21:12.739" style="s2">that&#39;s the argument that many people</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.210" end="00:21:14.450" style="s2">have said it&#39;s just so hopeless and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.739" end="00:21:16.279" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an argument that combines</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.450" end="00:21:18.049" style="s2">two claims one is that the brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.279" end="00:21:19.940" style="s2">organization isn&#39;t as an approach to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.049" end="00:21:22.099" style="s2">software is just hopeless and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.940" end="00:21:24.169" style="s2">just no good way to improve it or modify</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.099" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">it to be competitive with a claim that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.169" end="00:21:29.989" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to modify that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:32.479" style="s2">stuck whereas other kinds of software is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.989" end="00:21:35.359" style="s2">more robust to modification easier to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.479" end="00:21:37.429" style="s2">improve easier to generalize yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.359" end="00:21:38.779" style="s2">think that&#39;s in general would support</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.429" end="00:21:40.339" style="s2">that argument though I just thought of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.779" end="00:21:42.889" style="s2">something that actually may support your</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.339" end="00:21:45.769" style="s2">side a little bit which is another area</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.889" end="00:21:48.379" style="s2">there is increasing investment in is in</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.769" end="00:21:49.879" style="s2">neural man-machine interfaces</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.379" end="00:21:51.859" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m pretty skeptical about that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.879" end="00:21:54.139" style="s2">mattering much here okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.859" end="00:21:55.879" style="s2">each task will be done in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.139" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">hardware in a brain hardware or in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.879" end="00:22:00.200" style="s2">artificial hardware the neural interface</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:22:01.849" style="s2">basically increases the bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.200" end="00:22:04.070" style="s2">between tasks being done in different</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.849" end="00:22:06.409" style="s2">places so it allows more fine-grain</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.070" end="00:22:08.450" style="s2">interleaving but it doesn&#39;t really save</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.409" end="00:22:09.859" style="s2">the MS unless there&#39;s something a task</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.450" end="00:22:11.140" style="s2">that the MS are best at so there has to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.859" end="00:22:12.940" style="s2">be something there best at</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.140" end="00:22:15.010" style="s2">that you can you know integrate that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.940" end="00:22:16.420" style="s2">more at a fine-grain time and space</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.010" end="00:22:17.950" style="s2">scale with tasks done on artificial</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.420" end="00:22:19.870" style="s2">hardware the higher the bandwidth you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.950" end="00:22:22.510" style="s2">have between that well let me throw a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.870" end="00:22:25.000" style="s2">real-world example on where a loosely</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.510" end="00:22:27.190" style="s2">coupled man-machine interface beats</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.270" end="00:22:35.470" style="s2">also read that there are tournaments now</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.920" end="00:22:36.820" style="s2">where you take a very good grandmaster</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.820" end="00:22:50.230" style="s2">the two is considerably stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.100" end="00:22:52.570" style="s2">the best pure computer chess programs</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.230" end="00:22:54.250" style="s2">that&#39;s what I heard ten years ago I</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.930" end="00:23:09.880" style="s2">beat the Alfa chess 0 or something right</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.170" end="00:23:11.950" style="s2">interestingly that actually argues</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.880" end="00:23:14.230" style="s2">towards how rapidly you know regular</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.230" end="00:23:19.060" style="s2">anyway this has been a good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.730" end="00:23:21.700" style="s2">Ok Go Ahead</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.060" end="00:23:23.170" style="s2">I have a theory I tried an account I</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.700" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">tried to come up with what the essential</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.170" end="00:23:26.650" style="s2">difference between the software we</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.670" end="00:23:28.330" style="s2">usually write including a lot of machine</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.650" end="00:23:30.220" style="s2">learning software and the software in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.330" end="00:23:31.780" style="s2">our brains I think you need an account</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.220" end="00:23:32.950" style="s2">of the fundamental source of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.780" end="00:23:34.600" style="s2">difference in order to make a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.950" end="00:23:36.910" style="s2">intelligent estimate about which wins</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.600" end="00:23:39.220" style="s2">we&#39;re in a no longer competition so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.910" end="00:23:42.250" style="s2">propose that the key difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.220" end="00:23:44.560" style="s2">in the eons that evolution was evolving</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.250" end="00:23:47.350" style="s2">and improving the brain it never found</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.560" end="00:23:49.390" style="s2">some key abstractions that we have in</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.350" end="00:23:51.400" style="s2">software that we build our computers</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.390" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">around in particular it mixes up</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.400" end="00:23:56.610" style="s2">hardware and software it mixes up</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.040" end="00:24:00.310" style="s2">processing and memory it mixes up</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.610" end="00:24:02.620" style="s2">addresses and content it mixes learning</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.310" end="00:24:04.780" style="s2">and doing all these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.620" end="00:24:07.060" style="s2">usually in software try go out of our</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.780" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">way to separate to distinguish the brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.060" end="00:24:12.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it seems to basically mix them</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:14.710" style="s2">all up so in its search for improvements</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.850" end="00:24:16.720" style="s2">it was searching for variations that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.710" end="00:24:19.090" style="s2">were constrained to mix these things up</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.720" end="00:24:21.370" style="s2">and that first distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.090" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">hardware and software is perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.370" end="00:24:24.519" style="s2">most important so today when you sit</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:26.919" style="s2">down in front of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.519" end="00:24:28.899" style="s2">computer to write software you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.919" end="00:24:31.779" style="s2">limited processing but you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.899" end="00:24:33.700" style="s2">unlimited memory basically and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.779" end="00:24:35.889" style="s2">means that you can start with a blank</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.700" end="00:24:38.469" style="s2">screen and start to write a new piece of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.889" end="00:24:40.229" style="s2">code and then only connect this new</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.469" end="00:24:42.849" style="s2">piece of code to the old code you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.229" end="00:24:44.679" style="s2">when you see an advantage from that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.849" end="00:24:46.089" style="s2">you usually slow to do that and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.679" end="00:24:47.769" style="s2">cautious about that because you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.089" end="00:24:49.629" style="s2">more you connect to old stuff the harder</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.769" end="00:24:52.179" style="s2">it will be to change an update that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.629" end="00:24:54.639" style="s2">the standard issue of modularity so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.179" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">use modularity as an enormous power to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.639" end="00:24:58.509" style="s2">write software and we also do this in</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:00.789" style="s2">machine learning because we can because</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.509" end="00:25:03.249" style="s2">we have so much extra memory that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.789" end="00:25:05.379" style="s2">cheap and easy but the brain couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.249" end="00:25:07.269" style="s2">that that&#39;s the key point over the eons</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.379" end="00:25:08.979" style="s2">when the brain had an existing brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.269" end="00:25:11.139" style="s2">design and then it was evolving and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.979" end="00:25:13.690" style="s2">trying to add a new functionality or</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.139" end="00:25:16.149" style="s2">feature or capability it couldn&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.690" end="00:25:17.320" style="s2">with a blank screen because hardware and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.149" end="00:25:18.729" style="s2">software was mixed up it would have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.320" end="00:25:20.889" style="s2">add a new section to the brain to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.729" end="00:25:22.479" style="s2">that and the brain was pretty volume</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.889" end="00:25:24.339" style="s2">constrained and so what either have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.479" end="00:25:26.979" style="s2">delete some old section in order to add</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.339" end="00:25:29.950" style="s2">a new section or it would find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.979" end="00:25:32.919" style="s2">reorganized old things to allow the new</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.950" end="00:25:34.839" style="s2">thing to fit in more easily so it would</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.919" end="00:25:37.089" style="s2">focus a lot on reorganization and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.839" end="00:25:39.399" style="s2">especially abstraction which is the key</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.089" end="00:25:41.349" style="s2">way that you can take multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.399" end="00:25:43.239" style="s2">and make a smaller shorter version of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.349" end="00:25:45.909" style="s2">them that allows more room to doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.239" end="00:25:48.009" style="s2">other things so the key idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.909" end="00:25:50.619" style="s2">that relative does software familiar</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.009" end="00:25:53.019" style="s2">with the brain is this marvel of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.619" end="00:25:53.619" style="s2">integration and abstraction but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.019" end="00:25:55.359" style="s2">very modular</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.619" end="00:25:58.659" style="s2">you know that&#39;s obvious when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.359" end="00:26:01.359" style="s2">the wiring diagram and the software</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.659" end="00:26:02.859" style="s2">rewrite is much more modular therefore</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.359" end="00:26:04.929" style="s2">we don&#39;t pay as much of attention there</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.859" end="00:26:06.489" style="s2">to organization reorganization and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.929" end="00:26:08.799" style="s2">abstraction because it&#39;s not worth the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.489" end="00:26:11.320" style="s2">bother when we can so easily just start</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.799" end="00:26:12.789" style="s2">with a new blank screen but because we</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.320" end="00:26:15.700" style="s2">have the standard habit and software</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.789" end="00:26:17.739" style="s2">software rots faster than brain software</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.700" end="00:26:18.940" style="s2">and this is the overwhelming observation</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.739" end="00:26:21.249" style="s2">of software in the real world is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.940" end="00:26:22.469" style="s2">even though we have decades of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.249" end="00:26:24.969" style="s2">ready software to do so many things</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.469" end="00:26:27.519" style="s2">typically a software system rots with</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.969" end="00:26:29.979" style="s2">time it becomes harder to modify harder</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.519" end="00:26:32.440" style="s2">to usefully change harder to understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.979" end="00:26:34.329" style="s2">and eventually people just toss it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.440" end="00:26:35.950" style="s2">they start with a new blank screen and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.329" end="00:26:36.550" style="s2">make whole new systems at enormous</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.950" end="00:26:39.390" style="s2">expense</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.550" end="00:26:42.280" style="s2">but we apparently haven&#39;t found ways to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.390" end="00:26:44.200" style="s2">inherit most old code that does similar</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.280" end="00:26:45.550" style="s2">things instead we mostly throw it away</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.200" end="00:26:47.800" style="s2">and start with something new because our</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.550" end="00:26:49.059" style="s2">systems rot so that gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.800" end="00:26:50.890" style="s2">perspective on the advantages and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.059" end="00:26:53.710" style="s2">disadvantages of Em&#39;s relative to other</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.890" end="00:26:55.179" style="s2">software suggesting that on small tech</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.710" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">so you know one big a disadvantage of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.179" end="00:26:57.940" style="s2">the brain is in order to have the brain</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:27:00.460" style="s2">do anything you pretty much have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.940" end="00:27:02.470" style="s2">devote a whole brain to the task the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.460" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">brain is a big thing it&#39;s expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.470" end="00:27:06.340" style="s2">so most of the advantages we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">from software over the last 70 years are</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.340" end="00:27:09.130" style="s2">mainly to do small things what&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:10.780" style="s2">less software and hardware than the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.130" end="00:27:13.210" style="s2">whole brain which is an enormous savings</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.780" end="00:27:15.400" style="s2">and we should expect that to continue so</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.210" end="00:27:16.690" style="s2">for tasks that can be done by a small</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.400" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">piece of hardware and a small piece of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.690" end="00:27:21.370" style="s2">software that will just not be done by</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:24.190" style="s2">an M or human like mine but as you move</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.370" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">up the hierarchy of tasks to more</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.190" end="00:27:27.910" style="s2">general tasks that require wider scope</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:29.410" style="s2">and more things be integrated in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.910" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">experience we actually find it hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.410" end="00:27:33.429" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem of AGI generality we</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:34.990" style="s2">find it quite hard to make systems that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.429" end="00:27:36.429" style="s2">are general and broad and that can</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.990" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">integrate a wide range of things well</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.429" end="00:27:40.540" style="s2">and still be modifiable and easily</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:43.090" style="s2">updated and that&#39;s usually the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.540" end="00:27:44.830" style="s2">limitation and that&#39;s where human mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.090" end="00:27:46.660" style="s2">seems to Excel human mind seemed of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.830" end="00:27:48.460" style="s2">these dis marble of integration where</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.660" end="00:27:50.410" style="s2">they can pay attention to a wide range</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.460" end="00:27:54.010" style="s2">of things and integrate them well and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.410" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">not rot and so that suggests this future</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.010" end="00:27:57.910" style="s2">where there&#39;s you know like in a company</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:27:59.320" style="s2">an abstraction hierarchy of control and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.910" end="00:28:01.420" style="s2">there&#39;s people at top who have very wide</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.320" end="00:28:02.650" style="s2">scope and attention who look at you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.420" end="00:28:04.390" style="s2">long term things and people at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.650" end="00:28:06.760" style="s2">bottom would look at very small scope</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.390" end="00:28:09.280" style="s2">and very short term local considerations</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.760" end="00:28:11.559" style="s2">and those local considerations will</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.280" end="00:28:12.820" style="s2">obviously be done by automation and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.559" end="00:28:14.620" style="s2">will be the first thing automate but</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.820" end="00:28:16.990" style="s2">near the top of the control hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.620" end="00:28:18.820" style="s2">those things seem much more naturally to</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.990" end="00:28:20.590" style="s2">be done by humans or human-like Minds</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.820" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">and I would predict that Emmas have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.590" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">long future there so even again software</p>

<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:31.900" style="s2">high end than em you think there will be</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.900" end="00:28:36.400" style="s2">to do very broad integration and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.450" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">abstraction yes so that you know for an</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.400" end="00:28:40.210" style="s2">economist the question is not how smart</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:44.110" style="s2">is a thing it&#39;s sort of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.210" end="00:28:45.610" style="s2">cost-effective is a thing right so you</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.420" end="00:28:52.900" style="s2">cost hundred times as much you know so</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.010" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">when you say AG I could be smarter while</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.900" end="00:28:57.940" style="s2">I say well smarter than how many humans</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:59.140" style="s2">and at what cost right right etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.940" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">when we&#39;re thinking about this cost</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.140" end="00:29:03.030" style="s2">trade-off then I say near the high end</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:06.130" style="s2">of the up you know generality</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.030" end="00:29:09.820" style="s2">flexibility range of considerations</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.130" end="00:29:11.710" style="s2">spectrum of tasks that it looks to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.820" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">like the MS can win there for a long</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.710" end="00:29:15.640" style="s2">time especially considering that once ms</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:16.990" style="s2">are possible we can modify that software</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.640" end="00:29:18.370" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to stay the way it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.990" end="00:29:21.250" style="s2">initially did so then the question</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.370" end="00:29:22.690" style="s2">becomes how fast can that improve</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.250" end="00:29:24.340" style="s2">relative to how fast can other things</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.690" end="00:29:25.630" style="s2">improve and you&#39;d say well look we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.340" end="00:29:27.340" style="s2">been able to improve other things much</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.630" end="00:29:30.309" style="s2">faster but I&#39;d say well yes but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.340" end="00:29:32.200" style="s2">on very narrow tasks very narrow scopes</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.309" end="00:29:34.270" style="s2">you haven&#39;t really pressed into the hard</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.200" end="00:29:36.309" style="s2">problem of how to be general and broad</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.270" end="00:29:38.200" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an interesting point you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.309" end="00:29:40.809" style="s2">know how rigid will they have to be or</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.200" end="00:29:43.720" style="s2">how opaque is the other question and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.809" end="00:29:46.690" style="s2">is true that the deep learning neural</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.720" end="00:29:49.390" style="s2">models are almost as opaque is the human</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.690" end="00:29:51.670" style="s2">brain right indeed and they&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.390" end="00:29:54.429" style="s2">modular than people give them credit for</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.670" end="00:29:56.950" style="s2">in the sense that anyone saying neural</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.429" end="00:29:58.690" style="s2">nets say that does chess is this big</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.950" end="00:30:01.450" style="s2">opaque mess that does everything in</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.690" end="00:30:02.500" style="s2">chess at once but it only does chess you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.450" end="00:30:04.540" style="s2">know in the deep learning world people</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.500" end="00:30:05.980" style="s2">solve new problems with a blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.540" end="00:30:07.360" style="s2">basically they start with a blank net</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.980" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">and they you know learn a particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.360" end="00:30:12.010" style="s2">area with a particular data set they are</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">not making systems that do everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.010" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">all at once yeah it&#39;s actually by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:17.950" style="s2">way why I do not believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.470" style="s2">current deep learning neural net</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.950" end="00:30:22.900" style="s2">architecture is likely by itself to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.470" end="00:30:25.630" style="s2">us to AGI I know there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.900" end="00:30:28.090" style="s2">people out there these days who do but</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.630" end="00:30:29.559" style="s2">frankly I think it&#39;s like going into an</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.090" end="00:30:31.150" style="s2">orchard where everybody was picking</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.559" end="00:30:32.980" style="s2">fruit from the ground with a six-foot</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.150" end="00:30:34.600" style="s2">ladder and now you can pick a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.980" end="00:30:36.250" style="s2">fruit but eventually you&#39;ve picked it</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.600" end="00:30:36.820" style="s2">all all you can get with the six-foot</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.250" end="00:30:38.470" style="s2">ladder</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.820" end="00:30:41.559" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna need other approaches that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.470" end="00:30:43.000" style="s2">integrate probably multiple neural Nets</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.559" end="00:30:46.059" style="s2">and have the ability to generate new</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.000" end="00:30:47.920" style="s2">neural Nets on the fly under the control</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.059" end="00:30:50.920" style="s2">of a higher level abstraction perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.920" end="00:30:53.800" style="s2">more symbolic more probabilistic system</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.920" end="00:30:55.630" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll have a highly complicated</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.800" end="00:30:57.010" style="s2">you know system they&#39;ll probably by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.630" end="00:30:58.990" style="s2">time it gets to have the capability of</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.010" end="00:31:00.790" style="s2">human brain will probably be almost as</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.990" end="00:31:00.999" style="s2">complicated but the question will be to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.790" end="00:31:03.129" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.999" end="00:31:04.959" style="s2">is it modular and can it out evolve</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.129" end="00:31:07.329" style="s2">because in like in the business world</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.959" end="00:31:09.249" style="s2">where I come from the rate of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.329" end="00:31:11.379" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty much everything over the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.249" end="00:31:13.389" style="s2">long haul if you can make your product</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.379" end="00:31:15.189" style="s2">better than your doubling time is in</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.389" end="00:31:17.109" style="s2">values three years the other guy&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.189" end="00:31:20.279" style="s2">years before long you&#39;ve eaten its lunch</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.109" end="00:31:24.519" style="s2">the same would be true in a race between</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.279" end="00:31:27.429" style="s2">software-driven AGI versus ms if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.519" end="00:31:30.969" style="s2">could improve our software driven human</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.429" end="00:31:32.529" style="s2">level say equal to M faster than the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.969" end="00:31:34.289" style="s2">dominance of Em&#39;s could be pretty short</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.529" end="00:31:36.909" style="s2">and the key point to notice is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.289" end="00:31:38.949" style="s2">until we have MS the human stuff isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.909" end="00:31:40.509" style="s2">improving very fast at all so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.949" end="00:31:42.729" style="s2">definitely been the observation over the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.509" end="00:31:44.379" style="s2">last decades that you know human workers</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.729" end="00:31:46.859" style="s2">are not improving as fast as artificial</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.379" end="00:31:48.609" style="s2">software we we almost never see</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.859" end="00:31:50.139" style="s2">something that was being done by</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.609" end="00:31:51.909" style="s2">software being switched to being done by</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.139" end="00:31:53.289" style="s2">humans whereas we see a lot of cases for</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.909" end="00:31:54.579" style="s2">something that was being done by humans</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.289" end="00:31:56.349" style="s2">to switch to being done by artificial</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.579" end="00:31:57.849" style="s2">hardware and software so if that trend</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.349" end="00:31:59.529" style="s2">were to continue then it&#39;s just obvious</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.849" end="00:32:01.899" style="s2">that the humans lose when Em&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.529" end="00:32:04.539" style="s2">possible that game changes because now</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.899" end="00:32:06.009" style="s2">the human minds who are now ms can take</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.539" end="00:32:08.079" style="s2">advantage of the improvements in</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.009" end="00:32:09.969" style="s2">hardware think it didn&#39;t take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.079" end="00:32:11.829" style="s2">of scale economies and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.969" end="00:32:13.149" style="s2">factories etc to make many of them and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.829" end="00:32:14.859" style="s2">make them more cost-effective and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.149" end="00:32:17.619" style="s2">can even take advantage of their brains</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.859" end="00:32:19.809" style="s2">being modified by efforts to reorganize</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.619" end="00:32:21.429" style="s2">them and redesign them and to improve</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.809" end="00:32:22.569" style="s2">them and that is of course interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.429" end="00:32:25.239" style="s2">that there&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.569" end="00:32:27.339" style="s2">spend up 10 million M&#39;s to work on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.239" end="00:32:30.279" style="s2">problem of improving em so it&#39;s again a</p>

<p begin="00:32:30.279" end="00:32:33.999" style="s2">though probably flower but the key</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:36.489" style="s2">robust prediction is the growth rate</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.329" end="00:32:44.049" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t for Em&#39;s then we would much</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.309" end="00:32:46.089" style="s2">more despair of humans being able to</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.149" end="00:32:55.989" style="s2">think that&#39;s a very good optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.559" end="00:32:58.509" style="s2">point about the M world is it&#39;s probably</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.780" end="00:33:29.730" style="s2">getting another long point to argue and</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.890" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">so I feel somewhat confident in saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.590" end="00:33:57.270" style="s2">the key assumption behind that is some</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:59.640" style="s2">level of simplicity in the essential</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.270" end="00:34:01.530" style="s2">innovations that would be possible that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.640" end="00:34:03.960" style="s2">is there and some level there are some</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.530" end="00:34:05.900" style="s2">simple ideas that when you find them</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:08.310" style="s2">they give you these big improvements and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.900" end="00:34:10.650" style="s2">maybe let you find other simple ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.310" end="00:34:13.080" style="s2">that basically there is these big lumps</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.650" end="00:34:14.940" style="s2">of innovation to be found so to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.080" end="00:34:16.950" style="s2">extent that innovation typically isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.940" end="00:34:19.800" style="s2">that lumpy then I&#39;m much more skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.950" end="00:34:21.210" style="s2">about that because the the past we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.800" end="00:34:22.740" style="s2">seen a distribution of lumpiness but</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.210" end="00:34:25.980" style="s2">most innovation has been relatively</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.740" end="00:34:27.270" style="s2">small lumps a few big ones and because</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.980" end="00:34:29.490" style="s2">of that we&#39;ve seen relatively steady</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.270" end="00:34:31.140" style="s2">progress and I think that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.490" end="00:34:33.360" style="s2">predict those kinds of rates of progress</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.140" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">forward I love the quality of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.360" end="00:34:38.520" style="s2">analysis it&#39;s just so deep and again I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:41.060" style="s2">recommend the age of em to anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.520" end="00:34:44.280" style="s2">wants to see a beautifully constructed</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.060" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">scenario about something quite far into</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.280" end="00:34:49.320" style="s2">the future that if you accept the one</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:51.090" style="s2">premise makes a lot of sense now many</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.320" end="00:34:53.010" style="s2">people are scared by it I mean and in</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.090" end="00:34:54.540" style="s2">some sense rightly so that is if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.010" end="00:34:56.880" style="s2">thought of the history of say from</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.540" end="00:34:58.980" style="s2">animals to foraging humans to farming</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.880" end="00:35:01.350" style="s2">humans to industrial humans each of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.980" end="00:35:03.090" style="s2">those transitions was enormous and each</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.350" end="00:35:04.710" style="s2">of those transitions to somebody before</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.090" end="00:35:06.300" style="s2">the transition should have been scary if</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.710" end="00:35:08.160" style="s2">they had understood the basics of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.300" end="00:35:10.050" style="s2">because a lot would change in their</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.160" end="00:35:11.640" style="s2">world and some things would be lost some</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.050" end="00:35:13.830" style="s2">things they value were lost in each of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.640" end="00:35:15.240" style="s2">those transmissions and so you should</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.830" end="00:35:17.490" style="s2">expect the same thing of the next</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.240" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">transition enormous change in most</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.490" end="00:35:21.930" style="s2">aspects of society and therefore some</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">key things you treasure will be lost and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.930" end="00:35:26.460" style="s2">that&#39;s not crazy that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:27.540" style="s2">reasonable but then that&#39;s pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.460" end="00:35:30.330" style="s2">what you should expect</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.540" end="00:35:31.830" style="s2">in the long run future if you say I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.330" end="00:35:33.930" style="s2">like the world I&#39;m in and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.830" end="00:35:36.450" style="s2">anymore big changes you&#39;ve got a really</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.930" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">big problem in front of you because so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.450" end="00:35:40.230" style="s2">far we&#39;ve had big changes and how are</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:41.940" style="s2">you going to prevent them and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.230" end="00:35:43.800" style="s2">accelerating rate I mean that&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.940" end="00:35:47.580" style="s2">trend since you know the modern age</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.800" end="00:35:50.070" style="s2">started in 1625 on February 16th at 11</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.580" end="00:35:52.860" style="s2">p.m. right it&#39;s been accelerating ever</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.070" end="00:35:54.900" style="s2">since and at a pretty high rate actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.860" end="00:35:57.570" style="s2">I would say we have seen acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.900" end="00:35:59.940" style="s2">over time but in lumps so within each of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.570" end="00:36:01.110" style="s2">these eras say the animal error the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.940" end="00:36:02.310" style="s2">foraging or of the farming or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.110" end="00:36:04.110" style="s2">industrial error change has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.310" end="00:36:06.630" style="s2">relatively steady we has not been</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.110" end="00:36:08.310" style="s2">accelerating overall so even say over</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.630" end="00:36:09.570" style="s2">the last century I would say change has</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.310" end="00:36:11.370" style="s2">not been accelerating over the last</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.570" end="00:36:14.040" style="s2">century if you look at overall rates of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.370" end="00:36:15.360" style="s2">change but of course change today versus</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.040" end="00:36:17.460" style="s2">a thousand years ago is much higher</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.360" end="00:36:19.290" style="s2">because of the Industrial Revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.460" end="00:36:21.870" style="s2">then during the farming era from say</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.290" end="00:36:24.060" style="s2">5000 BC until a few hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.870" end="00:36:26.790" style="s2">change was relatively steady any much</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.060" end="00:36:29.100" style="s2">lower rate but it was faster than 100</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.790" end="00:36:30.690" style="s2">thousand years ago because the farming</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.100" end="00:36:32.850" style="s2">the foraging era was an even slower so</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.690" end="00:36:34.890" style="s2">I&#39;d say roughly we see steady rates of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.850" end="00:36:36.660" style="s2">change until we see a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.890" end="00:36:39.960" style="s2">these very big increases in the rates of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.660" end="00:36:41.850" style="s2">change and a i-rms could very well be</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.960" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">the sort of thing that triggers a big</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.850" end="00:36:45.900" style="s2">burst and rate of change</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:47.910" style="s2">oh that&#39;s interesting let&#39;s divert here</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.900" end="00:36:49.910" style="s2">a little bit and talk about the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.910" end="00:36:52.440" style="s2">that a race of change are not</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.910" end="00:36:56.070" style="s2">accelerating because I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.440" end="00:36:57.960" style="s2">common pop view is that they are not to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.070" end="00:36:59.970" style="s2">say that that is correct and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.960" end="00:37:02.070" style="s2">I&#39;d also want to know what&#39;s your metric</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.970" end="00:37:04.050" style="s2">and are we talking first derivatives or</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.070" end="00:37:06.360" style="s2">second derivatives that are or</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.050" end="00:37:09.180" style="s2">velocities that are stationary</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.360" end="00:37:10.590" style="s2">so the key point obviously is that our</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.180" end="00:37:12.780" style="s2">society is enormous there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.590" end="00:37:14.250" style="s2">different parts and in any one time some</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.780" end="00:37:16.440" style="s2">parts are changing faster than others so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.250" end="00:37:18.630" style="s2">it&#39;s always possible to look and find</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.440" end="00:37:21.270" style="s2">parts that are changing very rapidly but</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.630" end="00:37:24.060" style="s2">are they representative and so our best</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.270" end="00:37:25.350" style="s2">way to look at overall society averaging</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.060" end="00:37:27.300" style="s2">over all the different kinds of changes</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.350" end="00:37:30.330" style="s2">is economic measures because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.300" end="00:37:32.820" style="s2">basically average out how much more can</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.330" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">you get of what you want so economic</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.820" end="00:37:38.460" style="s2">growth basically is the ability of us</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:40.230" style="s2">all to get more of what we want and when</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.460" end="00:37:40.559" style="s2">growth happens it&#39;s because we can do</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.230" end="00:37:42.029" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.559" end="00:37:43.739" style="s2">and that&#39;s averaging over all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.029" end="00:37:45.299" style="s2">different things we want and so some</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.739" end="00:37:47.699" style="s2">things we want improve much faster and</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.299" end="00:37:49.739" style="s2">other things slower and the way we</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.699" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">average those is how important is each</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.739" end="00:37:53.939" style="s2">one from the point of view of getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:55.859" style="s2">what we want and so economic growth has</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.939" end="00:37:57.900" style="s2">been relatively steady in fact you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.859" end="00:37:59.519" style="s2">have a growth has arguably declined a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.900" end="00:38:01.619" style="s2">bit in the advanced countries over the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.519" end="00:38:03.599" style="s2">last you know 40 years and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.619" end="00:38:04.829" style="s2">stagnation or decline and then people</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.599" end="00:38:07.140" style="s2">have talked about that although</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.829" end="00:38:09.329" style="s2">worldwide because the poorer nations are</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.140" end="00:38:10.859" style="s2">growing faster worldwide growth isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.329" end="00:38:12.930" style="s2">slowed down but it&#39;s not sped up either</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.859" end="00:38:15.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s in terms of essentially</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.930" end="00:38:17.219" style="s2">productivity I presume productivity is</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.660" end="00:38:19.469" style="s2">producing the things we want so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.219" end="00:38:21.420" style="s2">basically the ability to get more of all</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.469" end="00:38:22.739" style="s2">we want it&#39;s gonna yeah and per capita</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.420" end="00:38:25.019" style="s2">I&#39;d like to say just have to adjust by</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.739" end="00:38:26.999" style="s2">population size to get a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.019" end="00:38:28.410" style="s2">advancement in some sense more</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.999" end="00:38:30.630" style="s2">population is one of the things we want</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.410" end="00:38:32.519" style="s2">so you shouldn&#39;t neglect that either so</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.630" end="00:38:34.920" style="s2">if we choose to have more population who</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.519" end="00:38:36.689" style="s2">get less that&#39;s still getting more what</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.920" end="00:38:39.029" style="s2">we wanted was to have more population to</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.689" end="00:38:40.979" style="s2">get less but the long-term trend I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.029" end="00:38:42.269" style="s2">say is Marlar G in terms of the total</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.979" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">productive that product the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.269" end="00:38:45.209" style="s2">asset a per capita self through most of</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.699" style="s2">the foraging world through most of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.209" end="00:38:49.949" style="s2">farming world per capita wealth did not</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.699" end="00:38:51.420" style="s2">change much the most of change was in</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.949" end="00:38:53.099" style="s2">the total number of people which is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.420" end="00:38:55.529" style="s2">the old standard theory predicts that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.099" end="00:38:58.019" style="s2">if we can grow people faster than the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.529" end="00:38:59.999" style="s2">economy grows we will and so then most</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.019" end="00:39:02.069" style="s2">growth will be eaten up by population</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.999" end="00:39:03.869" style="s2">change as opposed to per capita income</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.069" end="00:39:04.979" style="s2">change and it&#39;s only in the last few</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.869" end="00:39:06.359" style="s2">hundred years what we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.979" end="00:39:09.239" style="s2">grow the economy faster than the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.359" end="00:39:11.729" style="s2">population such that now the per capita</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.239" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">rate has gone up and gone up a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.729" end="00:39:14.339" style="s2">you know the last 400 years something</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:17.009" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.339" end="00:39:18.599" style="s2">okay well this is great I really think</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.009" end="00:39:20.130" style="s2">this is a very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.599" end="00:39:23.279" style="s2">conversation let&#39;s move on to our next</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.130" end="00:39:26.279" style="s2">topic which seems to be becoming a semi</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.279" end="00:39:28.949" style="s2">feature here on the Jim Rutte show which</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.279" end="00:39:30.599" style="s2">is the Fermi paradox for those listeners</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.599" end="00:39:35.789" style="s2">back to Los Alamos where they made the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.179" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">atomic bomb during World War two where</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.789" end="00:39:39.900" style="s2">the story is told that a group of very</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:43.199" style="s2">smart folks were sitting around a lunch</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.900" end="00:39:45.509" style="s2">table talking about how many intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.199" end="00:39:47.400" style="s2">races there were in the universe and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.509" end="00:39:49.380" style="s2">must be a bunch because we have these</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.400" end="00:39:52.110" style="s2">many stars these many galaxies it must</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.380" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">make some assumptions about planets etc</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.110" end="00:39:57.270" style="s2">and Enrico Fermi walked over and said</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.270" end="00:40:03.150" style="s2">are they right so where are these other</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.880" end="00:40:05.910" style="s2">intelligences in space and so far we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.150" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">been looking for 60 years or so and have</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.910" end="00:40:11.490" style="s2">seen no confirmed signals for anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.640" end="00:40:14.130" style="s2">that we would say is the sign of either</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.490" end="00:40:16.770" style="s2">an existing or previous intelligent race</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.130" end="00:40:19.140" style="s2">in the universe other than ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.770" end="00:40:21.810" style="s2">in general the argument falls into two</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.140" end="00:40:24.690" style="s2">categories one that there aren&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.810" end="00:40:27.270" style="s2">that for whatever reason we&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.690" end="00:40:28.650" style="s2">first race at least in the universe to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.270" end="00:40:31.050" style="s2">have reached the level of general</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.650" end="00:40:34.440" style="s2">intelligence and then the other fork is</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.050" end="00:40:36.630" style="s2">they&#39;re out there but they either are</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.440" end="00:40:38.760" style="s2">intentionally not showing themselves or</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.630" end="00:40:41.550" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the tools to detect them</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.760" end="00:40:43.890" style="s2">and so with that I&#39;m gonna throw it back</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.550" end="00:40:45.990" style="s2">to you Robin and tell me what you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.890" end="00:40:47.700" style="s2">about the Fermi paradox well so this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.990" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">a really big question and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.700" end="00:40:50.760" style="s2">important question and when I first</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:53.340" style="s2">started writing about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.760" end="00:40:56.280" style="s2">20 years ago I thought neglected and in</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:58.230" style="s2">many areas what I&#39;d often do is take the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.280" end="00:41:00.150" style="s2">data we have and try to be a little more</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">careful theoretically to ask what does</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.150" end="00:41:03.540" style="s2">this data predict or what are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">implications of this data what can we</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.540" end="00:41:08.610" style="s2">infer from this data and so on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:10.920" style="s2">cosmic scale the key data point is we</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.610" end="00:41:14.850" style="s2">don&#39;t see anything out there that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.920" end="00:41:18.030" style="s2">dead everything we&#39;ve ever seen anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.850" end="00:41:20.790" style="s2">on except on earth is dead and so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.030" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">question is how to explain that and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.790" end="00:41:24.690" style="s2">now we have to confront that to some</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">sort of theories and one of the theories</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.690" end="00:41:28.470" style="s2">we have to compare that to is our own</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:31.800" style="s2">theory over our own origin so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.470" end="00:41:33.840" style="s2">dead where did we come from and so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.800" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">have a story a set of stories that try</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.840" end="00:41:38.070" style="s2">to explain where we came from</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:40.230" style="s2">and they have to do with a path that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.070" end="00:41:42.300" style="s2">came along our ancestors came along the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.230" end="00:41:44.310" style="s2">very first kinds of life appeared and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.300" end="00:41:45.720" style="s2">new kinds of life appeared more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.310" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">kinds of life eventually humans</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.720" end="00:41:51.000" style="s2">eventually humans grew to this level and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:53.010" style="s2">that theory of our past is a set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.000" end="00:41:54.590" style="s2">theories that mostly explains</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.010" end="00:41:58.290" style="s2">improvement through some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.590" end="00:42:00.300" style="s2">evolutionary or competition which is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.290" end="00:42:03.630" style="s2">sort of theory that predicts increasing</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.300" end="00:42:06.270" style="s2">capabilities and increasing range and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.630" end="00:42:06.540" style="s2">scope of environments and when you apply</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.270" end="00:42:08.460" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.540" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">sorts of theories to creatures like us</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.460" end="00:42:13.560" style="s2">at this stage we tend to predict more of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:15.450" style="s2">the same that is the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.560" end="00:42:17.670" style="s2">straightforward prediction of our future</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.450" end="00:42:19.590" style="s2">is that we will continue to become more</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.670" end="00:42:22.020" style="s2">technically capable that our economy</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.590" end="00:42:24.600" style="s2">will continue to grow and that we will</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.020" end="00:42:26.490" style="s2">therefore be able to survive in a wider</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.600" end="00:42:28.530" style="s2">range of environments we will take a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.490" end="00:42:30.530" style="s2">wider range of energy sources we will</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.530" end="00:42:32.670" style="s2">use a larger set of material and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.530" end="00:42:34.350" style="s2">therefore we will continue to grow and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.670" end="00:42:36.180" style="s2">this straight forward projection many</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.350" end="00:42:37.380" style="s2">people see is that that means we take</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.180" end="00:42:39.240" style="s2">over a larger section of the solar</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.380" end="00:42:42.540" style="s2">system and eventually take over larger</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.240" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">sections of the galaxy etc and those</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.540" end="00:42:46.020" style="s2">sorts of straightforward predictions of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:47.820" style="s2">our future run into the conflict that if</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.020" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">other places out there it would follow</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.820" end="00:42:51.660" style="s2">that same sort of trajectory they would</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:53.640" style="s2">eventually be visible and we would see</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.660" end="00:42:55.710" style="s2">them but we don&#39;t yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.640" end="00:42:58.140" style="s2">essence of the paradox right then the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.710" end="00:43:00.150" style="s2">key question is well how do we interpret</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.140" end="00:43:02.010" style="s2">all this so the way I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.150" end="00:43:05.070" style="s2">interpret it under the phrase the great</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.010" end="00:43:07.350" style="s2">filter is to say we can see this theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.070" end="00:43:10.110" style="s2">of a trajectory of going through these</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.350" end="00:43:12.690" style="s2">various steps as a theory of a path you</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.110" end="00:43:15.180" style="s2">go along but these paths can have</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.690" end="00:43:17.370" style="s2">filters along the way that is we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.180" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">imagine that at some point a process</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.370" end="00:43:20.970" style="s2">that goes along this path doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:23.460" style="s2">continuous stops so for example we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.970" end="00:43:26.550" style="s2">imagine say humans blowing themselves up</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.460" end="00:43:29.190" style="s2">and doing it so thoroughly that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.550" end="00:43:31.740" style="s2">prevent the rise of something like us a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.190" end="00:43:33.390" style="s2">few thousands of years later it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.740" end="00:43:35.630" style="s2">actually pretty hard to do that we an</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.390" end="00:43:38.130" style="s2">ordinary nuclear war doesn&#39;t quite do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.630" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">but the point is you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.130" end="00:43:43.320" style="s2">something that&#39;s thorough enough to keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:44.970" style="s2">it from going on or you can imagine say</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.320" end="00:43:46.230" style="s2">that evolution would have searched for</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.970" end="00:43:47.820" style="s2">billions of years in the space of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.230" end="00:43:49.500" style="s2">possible species but never come up with</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.820" end="00:43:51.210" style="s2">a species quite like humans with with</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.500" end="00:43:53.940" style="s2">our combination of intelligence and tool</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.210" end="00:43:55.770" style="s2">abilities and things like that and so if</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.940" end="00:43:57.960" style="s2">we think of this path but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.770" end="00:43:59.820" style="s2">guaranteed that the system goes along to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.960" end="00:44:01.320" style="s2">the next step in the path then we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.820" end="00:44:04.230" style="s2">think of this path as a process with</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.320" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">filters and then each step has a filter</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.230" end="00:44:07.860" style="s2">which is what&#39;s the chance that it goes</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:09.870" style="s2">on to the next step and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.860" end="00:44:12.180" style="s2">think of the great filter as the sum of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.870" end="00:44:13.710" style="s2">all those filters up to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.180" end="00:44:16.050" style="s2">something would be visible on the cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.710" end="00:44:17.400" style="s2">scale and then the claim is well there</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.050" end="00:44:19.260" style="s2">is a great filter</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.400" end="00:44:23.160" style="s2">we look out in the universe and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.260" end="00:44:25.230" style="s2">nothing has become really big invisible</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.160" end="00:44:27.480" style="s2">and so that means starting from any</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.230" end="00:44:29.400" style="s2">random spot it&#39;s really hard to go along</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.480" end="00:44:31.500" style="s2">that path to get to that end point its</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.400" end="00:44:35.010" style="s2">enormous ly hard it&#39;s astronomically</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.500" end="00:44:36.810" style="s2">hard literally so if we can see say 10</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.010" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">to the 22 planet is roughly out there</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.810" end="00:44:40.650" style="s2">and none of them are visible produced a</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:42.540" style="s2">visible civilization then the total</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.650" end="00:44:46.260" style="s2">filter is more than a factor of 10 to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.540" end="00:44:48.320" style="s2">the 22 and that&#39;s a puzzle yeah I like</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.260" end="00:44:50.910" style="s2">the filter metaphor you can take the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.320" end="00:44:53.130" style="s2">hundreds of arguments about the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.910" end="00:44:55.380" style="s2">and put them into the probably in terms</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.130" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">of early filter versus late filter also</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.380" end="00:44:59.220" style="s2">absolutely so this this is the key point</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:01.320" style="s2">from our point of view is we realize</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.220" end="00:45:03.720" style="s2">well we&#39;re only partly along this filter</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.320" end="00:45:05.070" style="s2">we&#39;re not actually at the moment capable</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.720" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">of being visible at a cosmic scale</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.070" end="00:45:08.790" style="s2">although we envision that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.650" style="s2">we would become that so there&#39;s a filter</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.790" end="00:45:13.770" style="s2">ahead of us and a filter behind us and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.650" end="00:45:16.260" style="s2">the biggest question for us is how far</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.770" end="00:45:17.460" style="s2">along the filter will become and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.260" end="00:45:20.760" style="s2">know the key point is if it&#39;s 10 to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.460" end="00:45:22.260" style="s2">22 and say we&#39;re 10 to the 20 along the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.760" end="00:45:24.150" style="s2">way but we still have 10 to the 2 to go</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.260" end="00:45:26.490" style="s2">that means we only have a 1% chance of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.150" end="00:45:27.060" style="s2">reaching that final point which is bad</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.490" end="00:45:30.120" style="s2">news</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.060" end="00:45:32.040" style="s2">it means most likely we fail and we fail</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.120" end="00:45:33.480" style="s2">pretty thoroughly in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.040" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">can imagine various disasters but if</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.480" end="00:45:36.780" style="s2">they only temporarily knock some parts</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:39.090" style="s2">of us down but not all of us thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.780" end="00:45:41.880" style="s2">down then we wouldn&#39;t take that long for</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.090" end="00:45:45.030" style="s2">those parts to regrow and regroup and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.880" end="00:45:46.410" style="s2">continue on so that means if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.030" end="00:45:48.540" style="s2">only a 1% chance of getting there</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.410" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a 99% chance of something in our</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.540" end="00:45:53.160" style="s2">future so thoroughly knocking us down</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.740" end="00:50:14.170" style="s2">be which is bad news so it will be bad</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.140" end="00:50:16.330" style="s2">news to see advanced life away from</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.170" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">Earth especially the more plausible it</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.330" end="00:50:20.650" style="s2">is that it had an independent origin one</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">plausible story though is that life was</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.650" end="00:50:24.730" style="s2">very unlikely to evolve but it evolved</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:26.830" style="s2">in the initial cluster of stars that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.730" end="00:50:28.600" style="s2">the nursery for our star so our star</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.830" end="00:50:30.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t arise by itself it arose at a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.600" end="00:50:31.660" style="s2">nursery with several hundred stars all</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.190" end="00:50:32.560" style="s2">together in the same molecule er cloud</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.660" end="00:50:34.600" style="s2">because that&#39;s typically how these</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.560" end="00:50:36.310" style="s2">things happen and so if that mucker</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.600" end="00:50:38.170" style="s2">cloud was a dense cloud where stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.310" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">traveled between different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.170" end="00:50:42.369" style="s2">cloud then it&#39;s plausible that even</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:44.410" style="s2">after our Sun formed and life forms soon</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.369" end="00:50:46.300" style="s2">there other parts that clown got the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.410" end="00:50:47.980" style="s2">life together and so the best place to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.300" end="00:50:49.750" style="s2">see it in our galaxy for other life is</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.980" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">the other siblings of our star and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.750" end="00:50:52.119" style="s2">would be actually relatively easy to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:53.980" style="s2">identify because they would have the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.119" end="00:50:55.690" style="s2">same mix of elements as our star in</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.980" end="00:50:56.410" style="s2">terms of the various kinds of elements</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.690" end="00:51:00.010" style="s2">that would have been in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.410" end="00:51:02.590" style="s2">so we can find our few hundred siblings</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.010" end="00:51:05.140" style="s2">of our star out there and if they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.590" end="00:51:07.240" style="s2">life around them that speaks to the rest</p>

<p begin="00:51:09.340" end="00:51:13.240" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t quite answer the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.870" end="00:51:15.400" style="s2">cosmological question right maybe it got</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.240" end="00:51:16.870" style="s2">lucky within the cluster on the early</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.460" end="00:51:30.820" style="s2">that there was propagation between us</p>

<p begin="00:51:34.450" end="00:51:38.020" style="s2">chain of course that depends where the</p>

<p begin="00:51:38.020" end="00:51:43.360" style="s2">turns out it was 4.5 billion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.080" end="00:51:44.980" style="s2">then some form of contagion amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.360" end="00:51:46.990" style="s2">might makes sense but if it was three</p>

<p begin="00:52:32.770" end="00:52:36.580" style="s2">themselves that&#39;s a great entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.020" end="00:52:38.530" style="s2">scenario and it&#39;s worth thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.580" end="00:52:41.740" style="s2">but over the years I just can&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.530" end="00:52:43.120" style="s2">work I just can&#39;t figure out how there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.980" end="00:53:07.460" style="s2">a little bit more weights quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.240" end="00:53:09.980" style="s2">more weights on early filters for</p>

<p begin="00:53:09.980" end="00:53:14.840" style="s2">assumption is that we have a</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.840" end="00:53:18.590" style="s2">time and giving enough time ought to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.580" end="00:53:21.980" style="s2">produce pretty amazing results</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.590" end="00:53:27.020" style="s2">however the mathematics of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.980" end="00:53:28.420" style="s2">require an error rate below X not to</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.420" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">catastrophe and we look at how</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:36.320" style="s2">information could be duplicated in an</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:38.690" style="s2">early warm pool soup before we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.320" end="00:53:40.910" style="s2">something like our DNA architecture with</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.690" end="00:53:43.220" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty heavy error checking and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.910" end="00:53:45.470" style="s2">error repair capability you run the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.220" end="00:53:48.740" style="s2">numbers and you go the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.470" end="00:53:52.550" style="s2">power of that pre error corrected</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.740" end="00:53:55.160" style="s2">information is pretty damn low so how</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.550" end="00:53:57.830" style="s2">did a low power ratchet without error</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.160" end="00:54:01.940" style="s2">correction it was it able to generate</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.830" end="00:54:04.340" style="s2">our high fidelity information ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.940" end="00:54:06.369" style="s2">around DNA and all of its duplication</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.340" end="00:54:08.210" style="s2">error detection and error correction</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.369" end="00:54:10.820" style="s2">components that has become my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.210" end="00:54:12.740" style="s2">early filter no doubt there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.820" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">earlier stages even before the sort of</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.170" end="00:54:24.650" style="s2">if that&#39;s not a life it there could be a</p>

<p begin="00:54:38.180" end="00:54:43.700" style="s2">seems mighty slow and that we probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.270" end="00:54:45.859" style="s2">have not had enough time so question is</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.700" end="00:54:48.890" style="s2">how quickly and by in what probability</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.859" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">we go from that low power evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.890" end="00:54:53.900" style="s2">machine with non error corrected data to</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">the high power evolutionary machine with</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.900" end="00:54:59.840" style="s2">error corrected DNA data and seems like</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:02.570" style="s2">a possible early filtering I then go and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.840" end="00:55:04.220" style="s2">say if we do have a strong early filter</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.570" end="00:55:06.410" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s one to my mind that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.220" end="00:55:09.020" style="s2">seems plausible then that has some very</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.410" end="00:55:10.250" style="s2">interesting moral implications you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.020" end="00:55:12.800" style="s2">this is something I would never believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.250" end="00:55:15.470" style="s2">when I was a 14 year old nerdy kid right</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.800" end="00:55:17.640" style="s2">which is that we might actually be the</p>

<p begin="00:55:30.990" end="00:55:35.369" style="s2">will be there if we&#39;re the only and</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.510" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">only thirteen point X billion years have</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.210" end="00:55:46.289" style="s2">gone by and if we&#39;re the only at that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:48.150" style="s2">point it&#39;s not a bad place to start as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.289" end="00:55:50.910" style="s2">betting proposition that we&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.150" end="00:55:52.349" style="s2">only at least for some reasonably very</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.910" end="00:55:54.569" style="s2">long period time and so we have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.349" end="00:55:56.970" style="s2">moral obligation to preserve this</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.569" end="00:55:58.859" style="s2">amazing thing life in the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.970" end="00:56:00.930" style="s2">maybe we can state the mission of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.859" end="00:56:02.789" style="s2">humanity is to bring the universe to</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.930" end="00:56:04.890" style="s2">life at least until we have some</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.789" end="00:56:06.510" style="s2">evidence that there is other advanced</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.510" end="00:56:09.930" style="s2">universe and then we get the hard</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.769" end="00:56:12.960" style="s2">question of ok how exactly can we do</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.930" end="00:56:14.549" style="s2">that how exactly can we ensure this big</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.960" end="00:56:15.960" style="s2">growth you know some people&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.549" end="00:56:17.819" style="s2">reaction is well we need to make new</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.960" end="00:56:19.380" style="s2">independent variations like a colony in</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.819" end="00:56:20.519" style="s2">all Mars or something although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.380" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">probably a lot easier to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.519" end="00:56:23.609" style="s2">independent colonies deep under the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">Earth&#39;s surface than putting them on</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.609" end="00:56:27.150" style="s2">Mars and so maybe we should be making a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:29.009" style="s2">lot more independent colonies under the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.150" end="00:56:30.690" style="s2">earth service but they aren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.009" end="00:56:32.009" style="s2">independent since that if there&#39;s a war</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.690" end="00:56:33.420" style="s2">or something we know where they are then</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.009" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">they&#39;ll kind of be recruited in the war</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.420" end="00:56:37.619" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a sense in which as long</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:40.349" style="s2">as we&#39;re part of this big integrated</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.619" end="00:56:42.359" style="s2">society we are all one big variation</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.349" end="00:56:44.910" style="s2">that&#39;ll have to continue because we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.359" end="00:56:46.349" style="s2">all find all the parts of us and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.910" end="00:56:47.880" style="s2">the question is well if we&#39;re all one</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.349" end="00:56:49.890" style="s2">thing should we try to go faster or</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.880" end="00:56:51.390" style="s2">slower so some people say if we go too</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.890" end="00:56:53.519" style="s2">fast we&#39;re gonna run into these problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.390" end="00:56:54.660" style="s2">and we better off to slow down so we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.519" end="00:56:56.849" style="s2">unresearched and understand these</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.660" end="00:56:58.470" style="s2">problems better and another point of</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.849" end="00:57:00.450" style="s2">view is that there&#39;s just problems that</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.470" end="00:57:01.980" style="s2">show someone independent rates and the</p>

<p begin="00:58:09.140" end="00:58:13.130" style="s2">would be good I guess it&#39;s somewhat</p>

<p begin="00:59:00.109" end="00:59:03.079" style="s2">would like a few hundred light years</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.249" end="00:59:05.179" style="s2">away somewhere else and make it be loud</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.079" end="00:59:07.009" style="s2">and then watch what happens to it that</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.179" end="00:59:08.719" style="s2">would be the safest approach yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.009" end="00:59:11.419" style="s2">might that was I would be tolerably in</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.719" end="00:59:12.949" style="s2">favor of that one big loud speaker or</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.419" end="00:59:14.989" style="s2">hundred light years away and with no way</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.949" end="00:59:16.189" style="s2">to trace it to us well I like it but</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.989" end="00:59:17.809" style="s2">making sure there&#39;s no way to trace it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.189" end="00:59:18.739" style="s2">to us would be really hard cuz you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.809" end="00:59:20.900" style="s2">know all the different detection</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.739" end="00:59:22.819" style="s2">capabilities to have it also made her an</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.900" end="00:59:25.549" style="s2">outfit the nearest 200 light years maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.819" end="00:59:26.679" style="s2">close it off too close then just kill</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.549" end="00:59:29.059" style="s2">everything within 300 light years</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.679" end="00:59:30.679" style="s2">exactly anyway there&#39;s been wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.059" end="00:59:33.589" style="s2">conversation let&#39;s move on to our next</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.679" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">topic this is actually what caused me to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.589" end="00:59:37.549" style="s2">reach out to you and ask you to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:40.280" style="s2">guest on the show which is I very</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.549" end="00:59:43.340" style="s2">recently read the elephant in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.280" end="00:59:45.830" style="s2">and was quite taken with it and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.340" end="00:59:48.650" style="s2">book that you co-wrote with a guy named</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.830" end="00:59:51.500" style="s2">Kevin similar yeah he&#39;s a great great</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.650" end="00:59:54.800" style="s2">co-author and the book is much easier to</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.500" end="00:59:57.260" style="s2">read and you know more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.800" end="00:59:58.520" style="s2">because of my co-author you can compare</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.260" end="01:00:01.070" style="s2">it to Age of M and you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.520" end="01:00:03.560" style="s2">difference for me this is an attempt</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.070" end="01:00:05.390" style="s2">near the end of my career to summarize a</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.560" end="01:00:07.220" style="s2">key point that I wish I had known at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.390" end="01:00:08.900" style="s2">beginning and that hopefully new</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.220" end="01:00:11.420" style="s2">generations of social scientists won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.900" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">make the same mistakes I and others and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.420" end="01:00:16.130" style="s2">my generation did because we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:18.590" style="s2">the one key fact to this book and so the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.130" end="01:00:21.380" style="s2">key story is that in social science and</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.590" end="01:00:23.690" style="s2">in policy we typically analyze something</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.380" end="01:00:25.970" style="s2">like education or medicine or even</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.690" end="01:00:28.460" style="s2">marriage from the point of view that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.970" end="01:00:30.230" style="s2">basically know what people are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.460" end="01:00:32.090" style="s2">do their basic goal or motive with</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.230" end="01:00:34.070" style="s2">respect to this thing and then that</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.090" end="01:00:35.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of complications and how</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.070" end="01:00:37.760" style="s2">to get that and that policy can help you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.990" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">figure out how to get this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.760" end="01:00:41.960" style="s2">obviously is the thing you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:43.610" style="s2">get so an education we&#39;d say the thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.960" end="01:00:45.800" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get is to learn more</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.610" end="01:00:47.900" style="s2">material faster and then education</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.800" end="01:00:50.450" style="s2">policy is all about how to reorganize</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.900" end="01:00:53.150" style="s2">schools or school funding or ratings</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.450" end="01:00:54.530" style="s2">such that we can induce more material to</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.150" end="01:00:56.900" style="s2">be learned faster or you would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.530" end="01:00:59.180" style="s2">medicine is obviously about taking sick</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.900" end="01:01:01.220" style="s2">people and getting them well and medical</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.180" end="01:01:02.990" style="s2">policy and medical reform and medical</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.220" end="01:01:05.240" style="s2">funding and institutions are all about</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.990" end="01:01:07.670" style="s2">figuring out better ways to get more</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.240" end="01:01:09.860" style="s2">people well or faster at a lower cost</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.670" end="01:01:12.470" style="s2">and this is what we do over and over</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.860" end="01:01:14.510" style="s2">again through our society what we in</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.470" end="01:01:16.460" style="s2">each area of life we have this easy</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.510" end="01:01:18.530" style="s2">assumption of what something is for and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.460" end="01:01:20.180" style="s2">then we build on that to analyze how we</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.530" end="01:01:22.010" style="s2">can do it better and the claim of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.180" end="01:01:24.560" style="s2">book is that through an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.010" end="01:01:27.230" style="s2">these areas the standard key assumption</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.560" end="01:01:29.090" style="s2">is just wrong schools are not about</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.230" end="01:01:30.740" style="s2">learning more material faster medicine</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.090" end="01:01:34.220" style="s2">is not about making sick people well</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.740" end="01:01:36.410" style="s2">that is at some level it&#39;s kind of about</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.220" end="01:01:38.380" style="s2">that it has some degree of functioning</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.410" end="01:01:41.000" style="s2">that we&#39;re but that&#39;s not really the key</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.380" end="01:01:43.610" style="s2">strongest motor that&#39;s driving these</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.000" end="01:01:46.370" style="s2">institutions and behaviors and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.610" end="01:01:48.530" style="s2">miss the key thing that something is for</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.370" end="01:01:49.940" style="s2">you&#39;re just gonna be misdirected right</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.530" end="01:01:52.069" style="s2">from the start so</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.940" end="01:01:54.560" style="s2">we have a long history in education</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.069" end="01:01:56.180" style="s2">research of finding many powerful ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.560" end="01:01:57.770" style="s2">to help people learn more material</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.180" end="01:02:00.020" style="s2">faster we actually know a lot about that</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.770" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">and we&#39;ve found many ways that existing</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.020" end="01:02:04.250" style="s2">schools could in fact teach more</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.910" end="01:02:06.890" style="s2">material faster more effectively lower</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.250" end="01:02:09.440" style="s2">cost etc and we&#39;ve consistently not</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.890" end="01:02:10.849" style="s2">adopted these reforms and that&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.440" end="01:02:12.380" style="s2">be pretty frustrating for education</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.849" end="01:02:13.970" style="s2">researchers and reformers who&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.380" end="01:02:16.520" style="s2">for many decades how we could do things</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.970" end="01:02:18.020" style="s2">better same in medicine we know lots of</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.520" end="01:02:19.880" style="s2">ways that medicine could be more</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.020" end="01:02:22.010" style="s2">effective people are not very interested</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.880" end="01:02:24.260" style="s2">in these ways and again that&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.010" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">frustrate medical reformers and social</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.260" end="01:02:29.210" style="s2">scientists and the PIA claim of the book</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:30.890" style="s2">is well the big mistake everybody&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.210" end="01:02:31.579" style="s2">making is assuming you know what these</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.890" end="01:02:34.609" style="s2">things are for</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.579" end="01:02:36.500" style="s2">so our book starts out trying to make it</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.609" end="01:02:38.839" style="s2">plausible that you would just be wrong a</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.500" end="01:02:41.869" style="s2">lot about why you want to do things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.839" end="01:02:43.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not aware of your motives so our</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.869" end="01:02:45.800" style="s2">book has been classified as psychology</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.640" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">and it had psychology referees and</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.800" end="01:02:51.589" style="s2">psychology reviewers and these</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">psychologists have all said yes this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.589" end="01:02:55.609" style="s2">a standard thing we know in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:57.650" style="s2">people are quite often unaware of their</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.609" end="01:02:59.740" style="s2">motives for doing things but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.650" end="01:03:02.630" style="s2">said we already knew that so who cares</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.740" end="01:03:05.150" style="s2">but in all these other policy areas like</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.630" end="01:03:07.220" style="s2">education to medicine etc these people</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.150" end="01:03:09.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know this and so our book is</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.220" end="01:03:11.660" style="s2">addressed to them trying to say you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.800" end="01:03:13.160" style="s2">been missing the point this thing these</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.660" end="01:03:15.170" style="s2">psychologists all know hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.160" end="01:03:17.180" style="s2">transferred into your social science and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.170" end="01:03:19.640" style="s2">policy worlds and you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.180" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2">appreciating that in fact you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.640" end="01:03:25.099" style="s2">mistaken assumptions about the key</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:26.960" style="s2">driving motives in these areas so we</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.099" end="01:03:28.250" style="s2">want our book to be read by social</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.960" end="01:03:29.510" style="s2">science and policy world but</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.250" end="01:03:31.460" style="s2">unfortunately because it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.510" end="01:03:33.530" style="s2">classified as psychology they don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.460" end="01:03:35.569" style="s2">that it&#39;s something they need to read or</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.530" end="01:03:37.700" style="s2">respond to them yeah I did notice that</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.569" end="01:03:40.010" style="s2">actually most of the piece parts from</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.700" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">which you built the theory were things</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.010" end="01:03:43.339" style="s2">other people had discovered and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:45.109" style="s2">you actually said that in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.339" end="01:03:46.579" style="s2">introduction that you had gone through a</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.109" end="01:03:49.099" style="s2">large amount of research and found</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.579" end="01:03:50.930" style="s2">things that were known but what was I</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.099" end="01:03:52.460" style="s2">found new was it you integrated it to</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.930" end="01:03:55.819" style="s2">show that this is a very consistent</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.460" end="01:03:57.500" style="s2">pattern and you also teased out at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.819" end="01:03:59.569" style="s2">some requite good arguments I thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.500" end="01:04:01.609" style="s2">for why it actually makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.569" end="01:04:03.589" style="s2">humans brains to evolve themselves this</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.609" end="01:04:06.799" style="s2">ways and in a lot of it comes around</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.589" end="01:04:08.660" style="s2">things like arms races one of the ones I</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.799" end="01:04:10.430" style="s2">liked a lot was the social brain eyes</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.660" end="01:04:12.319" style="s2">hypothesis or that you know what</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.430" end="01:04:14.619" style="s2">actually drove the rapid mega growth of</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.319" end="01:04:17.209" style="s2">the human brain was the ability to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.619" end="01:04:21.410" style="s2">Machiavellian within our within our own</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.209" end="01:04:23.329" style="s2">small groups or as Traverse put it we</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.410" end="01:04:26.809" style="s2">deceive ourselves the better to deceive</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.329" end="01:04:28.729" style="s2">others right and so I thought that was</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.809" end="01:04:30.319" style="s2">really where you guys delivered where</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.729" end="01:04:32.839" style="s2">you pulled together these various peace</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.319" end="01:04:34.609" style="s2">part and then also found the pieces that</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.839" end="01:04:36.680" style="s2">explained all the peace parts together</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.609" end="01:04:38.449" style="s2">we&#39;re doing some degree of synthesis but</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.680" end="01:04:40.039" style="s2">again I think a lot of people this area</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.449" end="01:04:41.660" style="s2">correctly would say well they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.039" end="01:04:43.249" style="s2">already understood that synthesis even</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.660" end="01:04:44.829" style="s2">if we&#39;re doing it especially good job</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.249" end="01:04:47.449" style="s2">say of explaining it to a wide audience</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.829" end="01:04:48.829" style="s2">what&#39;s new I would say is that we are</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.449" end="01:04:50.869" style="s2">trying to tell people in these other</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.829" end="01:04:52.940" style="s2">policy areas that they have neglected</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.869" end="01:04:54.529" style="s2">this key insight and so there is this</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.940" end="01:04:56.630" style="s2">basic problem in our academic</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.529" end="01:04:58.789" style="s2">intellectual world that we assume that</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.630" end="01:05:00.589" style="s2">once something it&#39;s known by the experts</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.789" end="01:05:02.299" style="s2">in that area it&#39;s known by everybody and</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.589" end="01:05:05.329" style="s2">included by everybody in their analysis</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.299" end="01:05:06.619" style="s2">and that&#39;s just not true there are great</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.329" end="01:05:08.749" style="s2">many things that are known in one</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.619" end="01:05:10.430" style="s2">subfield that are completely neglected</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.749" end="01:05:10.789" style="s2">in lots of other areas where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.430" end="01:05:13.009" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.789" end="01:05:15.019" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s clearly been true I have</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.009" end="01:05:18.349" style="s2">done a little dive into the move from</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.019" end="01:05:20.989" style="s2">educational psychology to education</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.349" end="01:05:23.749" style="s2">departments at universities it&#39;s like 50</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.989" end="01:05:25.130" style="s2">year lag it&#39;s pretty amazing our thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.749" end="01:05:27.259" style="s2">may also suffer a lag because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.130" end="01:05:30.259" style="s2">also lags for things people don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.259" end="01:05:31.539" style="s2">to hear so in the in on the history of</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.259" end="01:05:33.859" style="s2">innovation and intellectual progress</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.539" end="01:05:35.660" style="s2">things that people want to hear at least</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.859" end="01:05:37.489" style="s2">that don&#39;t conflict with something they</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.660" end="01:05:39.650" style="s2">want to believe are easier to assimilate</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.489" end="01:05:41.719" style="s2">and spread the things that people just</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.650" end="01:05:43.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want to hear that go against what</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.719" end="01:05:45.469" style="s2">they want to believe yeah one of those</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.160" end="01:05:47.900" style="s2">that came up again and again as I say in</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.469" end="01:05:50.329" style="s2">your applied chapters was that so much</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.900" end="01:05:52.039" style="s2">of human behavior can be thought of in</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.329" end="01:05:54.920" style="s2">terms of signaling as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.039" end="01:05:56.900" style="s2">substance right so the key general idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.920" end="01:05:59.150" style="s2">is that when we are trying to attribute</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.900" end="01:06:02.239" style="s2">motives to our behavior we are mostly</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.150" end="01:06:04.219" style="s2">acting as a PR person or press agent for</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.239" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">ourselves that is instead of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.219" end="01:06:08.690" style="s2">what we actually doing we&#39;re more like</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:10.400" style="s2">the president&#39;s press secretary who is</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.690" end="01:06:12.289" style="s2">trying to make up good explanations for</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.400" end="01:06:12.590" style="s2">doing in order to present a good face to</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.289" end="01:06:14.450" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.590" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking for explanations that</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.450" end="01:06:18.170" style="s2">defend us well against potential</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:20.780" style="s2">accusations and the explanations we come</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.170" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">us do achieve that function they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.780" end="01:06:24.950" style="s2">not really designed to be accurate</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:26.840" style="s2">representations of the real motives that</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.950" end="01:06:29.600" style="s2">are driving us because the real motives</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.840" end="01:06:31.820" style="s2">tend to be less pretty and more socially</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.600" end="01:06:33.590" style="s2">dysfunctional and more open to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.820" end="01:06:35.840" style="s2">accusation that we&#39;re violating social</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.590" end="01:06:38.000" style="s2">norms of being selfish and self-serving</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.840" end="01:06:40.490" style="s2">which we are and therefore we look for</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.000" end="01:06:42.320" style="s2">more pro-social good looking motives to</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.490" end="01:06:45.470" style="s2">attribute to ourselves certainly seems</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.320" end="01:06:46.970" style="s2">to be the case the section on medicine</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.470" end="01:06:49.040" style="s2">was particularly interesting cuz you</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.970" end="01:06:50.450" style="s2">maybe talk about that a little bit sure</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.040" end="01:06:52.670" style="s2">so that&#39;s for many of our readers</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.450" end="01:06:54.860" style="s2">perhaps the most surprising chapter in</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.670" end="01:06:56.840" style="s2">each chapter in the last two thirds of</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.860" end="01:06:59.300" style="s2">the book the ten different areas what we</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.840" end="01:07:00.860" style="s2">do is we say here&#39;s the topic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.300" end="01:07:02.660" style="s2">talking about and here is the standard</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.860" end="01:07:04.310" style="s2">motive most people would point to and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.660" end="01:07:05.990" style="s2">then here are a bunch of puzzles with</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.310" end="01:07:08.000" style="s2">that things that don&#39;t fit so well with</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.990" end="01:07:10.760" style="s2">the standard motive and then we finish</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.000" end="01:07:12.740" style="s2">with an explanation a motive that fits</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.760" end="01:07:16.040" style="s2">better with many of the details of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.740" end="01:07:17.930" style="s2">area so as if we said before the usual</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.040" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">story about medicine is that hey you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.930" end="01:07:21.470" style="s2">get sick but there&#39;s these experts out</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:23.900" style="s2">there who could help get you well these</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.470" end="01:07:26.000" style="s2">experts are expensive and they are hard</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.900" end="01:07:27.830" style="s2">to judge who&#39;s good but hey we need a</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.000" end="01:07:30.200" style="s2">system to help you get their expertise</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.830" end="01:07:32.780" style="s2">to help you go well and this basic story</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.200" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">is a story we usually tell and it</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.780" end="01:07:37.310" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit that well with a number of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:39.020" style="s2">actual details of this area and perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.310" end="01:07:40.730" style="s2">the most prominent one is the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.020" end="01:07:42.650" style="s2">there&#39;s very little correlation between</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.730" end="01:07:45.140" style="s2">people who get more medicine and people</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.650" end="01:07:47.180" style="s2">who get healthier we have not only</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.140" end="01:07:49.400" style="s2">geographic variation where we look at</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.180" end="01:07:51.800" style="s2">some regions or hospital areas and see</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.400" end="01:07:53.870" style="s2">the ones that spend more on medicine are</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.800" end="01:07:55.460" style="s2">not healthier even after we control for</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.870" end="01:07:57.230" style="s2">some other things we also have a number</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.460" end="01:07:59.780" style="s2">of randomized experiments where people</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.230" end="01:08:02.510" style="s2">randomly given more access to medicines</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.780" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">such as through a cheaper price and they</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.510" end="01:08:06.140" style="s2">weren&#39;t healthier that&#39;s a big puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:08.000" style="s2">from the point of view that the whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.140" end="01:08:09.470" style="s2">point of medicine is to spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:11.240" style="s2">money to get healthy but we have a</p>

<p begin="01:13:29.410" end="01:13:34.090" style="s2">method says that you should look at the</p>

<p begin="01:13:53.890" end="01:13:57.580" style="s2">cost-effective so you can just drop</p>

<p begin="01:13:57.580" end="01:14:01.870" style="s2">another way to drop half of your</p>

<p begin="01:14:13.300" end="01:14:18.490" style="s2">politics people are especially sensitive</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.060" end="01:14:19.870" style="s2">about politics it&#39;s actually emotional</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.490" end="01:14:21.910" style="s2">and they&#39;ve got a lot invested this well</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.870" end="01:14:24.010" style="s2">actually some people are so in all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.910" end="01:14:26.140" style="s2">different ten areas we discuss people</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.010" end="01:14:28.390" style="s2">vary a lot about how central those</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.140" end="01:14:29.980" style="s2">things are to their identity so for many</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.390" end="01:14:31.660" style="s2">of you medicine is not central to your</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.980" end="01:14:33.010" style="s2">identity and you were fine with what I</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.660" end="01:14:34.930" style="s2">just said in the last few minutes and</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.010" end="01:14:36.250" style="s2">for other view medicine was central to</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.930" end="01:14:37.870" style="s2">your identity and you&#39;re very skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.250" end="01:14:39.430" style="s2">use really important to you to believe</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.870" end="01:14:42.070" style="s2">that medicine is effective</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.430" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">similarly in politics some of you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.070" end="01:14:45.310" style="s2">care much about politics you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:47.380" style="s2">cynical or skeptical about it and what</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.310" end="01:14:49.150" style="s2">I&#39;m about to say will sound fine and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.380" end="01:14:50.890" style="s2">others of you will be much more</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.150" end="01:14:53.890" style="s2">skeptical because politics is really</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.890" end="01:14:55.720" style="s2">important to you so the usual story</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.890" end="01:14:57.280" style="s2">about politics is that you get involved</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.720" end="01:15:00.220" style="s2">with politics you read about it you talk</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.280" end="01:15:01.700" style="s2">about it because you are helping you are</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.220" end="01:15:04.130" style="s2">a Dudley do-right</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.700" end="01:15:06.110" style="s2">you are making contributions to your</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.130" end="01:15:07.820" style="s2">society by thinking carefully about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.110" end="01:15:10.640" style="s2">better political positions the better</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.820" end="01:15:12.740" style="s2">politicians etc and then making good</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.640" end="01:15:15.470" style="s2">choices that will benefit all of us good</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.740" end="01:15:17.270" style="s2">for you that&#39;s the usual story people</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.470" end="01:15:20.450" style="s2">want to give to explain their political</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.270" end="01:15:22.610" style="s2">behavior and that story just doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.450" end="01:15:24.860" style="s2">with a lot of details about people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.610" end="01:15:28.070" style="s2">political behavior for one thing you are</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.860" end="01:15:31.040" style="s2">just way too emotional and very</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.070" end="01:15:32.990" style="s2">uninformed about most political opinions</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.040" end="01:15:34.370" style="s2">you have people seem quite free to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.990" end="01:15:36.410" style="s2">political opinions they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.370" end="01:15:39.590" style="s2">researched much at all and they seem</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.410" end="01:15:40.700" style="s2">very confident of them even though these</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.590" end="01:15:42.770" style="s2">things are usually pretty complicated</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.700" end="01:15:45.650" style="s2">and there&#39;s a number of other puzzles</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.770" end="01:15:47.840" style="s2">that just don&#39;t fit with the usual story</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.650" end="01:15:49.430" style="s2">so if for example you really cared about</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.840" end="01:15:51.200" style="s2">producing good political outcomes you</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.430" end="01:15:53.150" style="s2">would want say to pick politicians who</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.200" end="01:15:56.360" style="s2">were good operatives who knew how to</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.150" end="01:15:58.730" style="s2">work the machine behind the scenes they</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.360" end="01:16:01.430" style="s2">could craft bills and negotiate deals</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.730" end="01:16:02.960" style="s2">and you&#39;d want somebody who was good at</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.430" end="01:16:04.400" style="s2">all of that and you wouldn&#39;t care so</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.960" end="01:16:05.630" style="s2">much about what public positions they</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.400" end="01:16:07.190" style="s2">took and you wouldn&#39;t necessarily want</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.630" end="01:16:08.480" style="s2">them to take extreme positions that</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.190" end="01:16:10.910" style="s2">would limit their ability to make deals</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.480" end="01:16:13.190" style="s2">you&#39;d want them to be good at making</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.910" end="01:16:15.020" style="s2">deals but in fact people seem to care</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.190" end="01:16:16.040" style="s2">mostly about the positions politicians</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.020" end="01:16:17.600" style="s2">take and they don&#39;t care much about</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.040" end="01:16:18.350" style="s2">whether they&#39;re good at actually making</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.600" end="01:16:20.300" style="s2">things happen</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.350" end="01:16:22.190" style="s2">they want politicians who share their</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.300" end="01:16:24.080" style="s2">positions and of course politicians are</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.190" end="01:16:25.460" style="s2">happy to supply that but it calls into</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.080" end="01:16:27.230" style="s2">question the idea that what you really</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.460" end="01:16:29.210" style="s2">want to do is produce more effective</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.230" end="01:16:31.190" style="s2">policy and there&#39;s a number of other</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.210" end="01:16:32.810" style="s2">puzzles we go into we say the better</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.190" end="01:16:35.510" style="s2">explanation here is that what you want</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.810" end="01:16:38.240" style="s2">to do is show your support for your</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.510" end="01:16:40.760" style="s2">political allies there&#39;s your team and</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.240" end="01:16:43.430" style="s2">you want to say yay US team and I&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.760" end="01:16:45.740" style="s2">you and most of what people do actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.430" end="01:16:47.540" style="s2">does a pretty good job with that people</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.740" end="01:16:49.100" style="s2">are very effective at that and that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.540" end="01:16:50.270" style="s2">some sense much more plausible about</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.100" end="01:16:51.830" style="s2">something you would actually care about</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.270" end="01:16:54.200" style="s2">in the sense that the people around you</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.830" end="01:16:56.660" style="s2">do look at you and interpret you in</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.200" end="01:16:58.430" style="s2">terms of a political lens they ask whose</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.660" end="01:17:00.230" style="s2">side are you on and are you loyal and</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.430" end="01:17:01.820" style="s2">that affects whether they want to relate</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.230" end="01:17:03.710" style="s2">to you so people seem to care a lot</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.820" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">about whether their spouses and lovers</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.710" end="01:17:08.060" style="s2">share their political views about</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:10.640" style="s2">whether people at school do whether</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.060" end="01:17:12.500" style="s2">people on the job do this matters a lot</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.640" end="01:17:14.210" style="s2">to people and it&#39;s a strong selection</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.500" end="01:17:14.950" style="s2">effect on people whether they you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.210" end="01:17:17.290" style="s2">have the political</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.950" end="01:17:19.150" style="s2">use that the people around them like so</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.290" end="01:17:21.250" style="s2">that&#39;s all very plausible but of course</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.150" end="01:17:23.560" style="s2">it means that our political system isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.250" end="01:17:26.380" style="s2">designed or necessarily doing a very</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.560" end="01:17:28.600" style="s2">good job of producing good policies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.380" end="01:17:31.030" style="s2">allowing a lot of people to take sides</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.600" end="01:17:32.680" style="s2">and to show loyalty to their sides now</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.030" end="01:17:35.050" style="s2">this is an area I&#39;ve done a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.680" end="01:17:38.050" style="s2">of thinking in and I would say call my</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.050" end="01:17:41.110" style="s2">perspective a more institutional one and</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.050" end="01:17:42.880" style="s2">that the behaviors you say you see in</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.110" end="01:17:45.640" style="s2">fact in my own writings on this I just</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.880" end="01:17:47.590" style="s2">refer to the two teams as team red and</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.640" end="01:17:49.810" style="s2">team blue to make them seem as much like</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.590" end="01:17:51.790" style="s2">football teams as anything else because</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.810" end="01:17:54.430" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly how the behaviors come</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.790" end="01:17:56.890" style="s2">about my argument though is that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.430" end="01:17:59.500" style="s2">necessarily driven by human nature or</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.890" end="01:18:02.080" style="s2">culture but rather by the institutional</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.500" end="01:18:03.970" style="s2">design of our political system in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.080" end="01:18:08.020" style="s2">case the United States we have one of</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.970" end="01:18:11.230" style="s2">the strongest set of constitutional and</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.020" end="01:18:14.230" style="s2">traditional settings to produce a to</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.230" end="01:18:15.460" style="s2">team dynamic we have a single member</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.230" end="01:18:18.630" style="s2">election districts with</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.460" end="01:18:21.280" style="s2">first-past-the-post usually plurality</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.630" end="01:18:23.980" style="s2">wins and then we also have a</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.280" end="01:18:26.350" style="s2">congressional system where control is by</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.980" end="01:18:28.840" style="s2">one party typically in one house which</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.350" end="01:18:30.970" style="s2">argue strongly for very strong</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.840" end="01:18:33.340" style="s2">coalition&#39;s are at very strong parties</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.970" end="01:18:35.320" style="s2">to win a majority so that they control</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.340" end="01:18:37.660" style="s2">the house of Congress and I look at that</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.320" end="01:18:40.270" style="s2">and I&#39;ve looked at another institutional</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.660" end="01:18:41.590" style="s2">design which I think could address that</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.270" end="01:18:44.260" style="s2">and produce a very different result</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.590" end="01:18:46.570" style="s2">which is liquid democracy also known as</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.260" end="01:18:49.180" style="s2">delegate of democracy where there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.570" end="01:18:51.820" style="s2">any teams essentially each voter</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.180" end="01:18:54.130" style="s2">allocates their vote people who</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.820" end="01:18:56.890" style="s2">represent them and in my version of</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.130" end="01:18:59.020" style="s2">liquid democracy that vote is divided up</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.890" end="01:19:01.390" style="s2">and does something like 25 issue areas</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.020" end="01:19:05.020" style="s2">like defense and economy health care</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.390" end="01:19:09.070" style="s2">education and so let&#39;s say I&#39;m Mary</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.020" end="01:19:11.620" style="s2">voter and I give my education vote to my</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.070" end="01:19:13.480" style="s2">sister who&#39;s a teacher and to my uncle</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.620" end="01:19:15.010" style="s2">who&#39;s a retired lieutenant for defense</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.480" end="01:19:18.910" style="s2">the retired lieutenant colonel in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.010" end="01:19:20.650" style="s2">Air Force etc and I&#39;ve taken my vote and</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.910" end="01:19:22.600" style="s2">pushed it to people who probably are</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.650" end="01:19:24.110" style="s2">more knowledgeable than I am in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.600" end="01:19:25.880" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.110" end="01:19:28.370" style="s2">no where does that get aggregated into a</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.880" end="01:19:30.920" style="s2">team rather each issue that gets floated</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.370" end="01:19:32.990" style="s2">by a person and an initiation of</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.920" end="01:19:34.880" style="s2">legislations gets voted on by these</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.990" end="01:19:37.360" style="s2">proxies without any intermediary</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.880" end="01:19:40.910" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t have the institutional</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.360" end="01:19:43.460" style="s2">dynamic that we see in our system so in</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.910" end="01:19:45.440" style="s2">our book in all of these areas we are</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.460" end="01:19:47.840" style="s2">first just trying to look at broad</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.440" end="01:19:50.270" style="s2">averages of human behavior across a wide</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.840" end="01:19:51.890" style="s2">range of space and times for example in</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.270" end="01:19:53.600" style="s2">medicine there are some different things</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.890" end="01:19:54.950" style="s2">about the United States versus the rest</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.600" end="01:19:56.150" style="s2">of the world but we&#39;re not focused on</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.950" end="01:19:57.620" style="s2">that we&#39;re not trying to explain why is</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.150" end="01:20:00.320" style="s2">the United States different we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.620" end="01:20:02.780" style="s2">to say why is medicine everywhere at all</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.320" end="01:20:05.180" style="s2">times has certain common characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.780" end="01:20:07.250" style="s2">so I&#39;d say the same about politics were</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.180" end="01:20:08.990" style="s2">mainly trying to look at the common</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.250" end="01:20:11.480" style="s2">features of politics across a wide range</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.990" end="01:20:13.730" style="s2">of contexts and for example in your</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.480" end="01:20:15.350" style="s2">church in your firm in your family there</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.730" end="01:20:17.780" style="s2">is politics we talk about office</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.350" end="01:20:20.180" style="s2">politics for example and these other</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.780" end="01:20:22.220" style="s2">political arenas have a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.180" end="01:20:25.130" style="s2">similar sorts of features and effects</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.220" end="01:20:28.430" style="s2">and so it&#39;s less trying to focus on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.130" end="01:20:31.550" style="s2">United States today and in the year 2019</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.430" end="01:20:33.500" style="s2">or even all democracies there is going</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.550" end="01:20:35.930" style="s2">to be variations based on institutions</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.500" end="01:20:37.310" style="s2">as you say and lots of other context but</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.930" end="01:20:39.140" style="s2">our first priority is just try to look</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.310" end="01:20:41.090" style="s2">at the very basic overall patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.140" end="01:20:43.940" style="s2">so we&#39;re usually immersed in a variety</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.090" end="01:20:46.130" style="s2">of context and our politics varies by</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.940" end="01:20:48.290" style="s2">context and we often try to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.130" end="01:20:49.640" style="s2">to integrate them at a lower cost so for</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.290" end="01:20:51.380" style="s2">example in your firm there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.640" end="01:20:53.390" style="s2">different factions and you&#39;ll be aligned</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.380" end="01:20:55.730" style="s2">with some faction and then in a meeting</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.390" end="01:20:57.350" style="s2">you might try to promote your faction in</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.730" end="01:20:58.850" style="s2">that meeting and that would be politics</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.350" end="01:20:59.870" style="s2">often the main thing you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.850" end="01:21:02.030" style="s2">is make sure other people in your</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.870" end="01:21:03.860" style="s2">faction know that you are still with</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.030" end="01:21:05.570" style="s2">them and supporting their faction now in</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.860" end="01:21:07.190" style="s2">many firms that the main division is</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.570" end="01:21:10.280" style="s2">between you know the top and the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.190" end="01:21:12.200" style="s2">and then you might be trying to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.280" end="01:21:14.780" style="s2">not rebelling against the top I&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.200" end="01:21:16.400" style="s2">the top I&#39;m loyal and that would be the</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.780" end="01:21:18.350" style="s2">main thing you were trying to show it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.400" end="01:21:19.940" style="s2">be less one faction against another then</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.350" end="01:21:21.530" style="s2">there&#39;s the dominant powers and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.940" end="01:21:23.630" style="s2">trying to show your submission to them</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.530" end="01:21:25.310" style="s2">and so they you know the simile in your</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.630" end="01:21:28.070" style="s2">church that might be factions or there</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.310" end="01:21:30.500" style="s2">might be one dominant coalition and your</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.070" end="01:21:33.350" style="s2">family but we still have politics and</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.500" end="01:21:35.780" style="s2">all these contexts in the sense that we</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.350" end="01:21:37.670" style="s2">take positions we express opinions on</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.780" end="01:21:40.580" style="s2">what would be good policies</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.670" end="01:21:42.440" style="s2">who should be in charge and again in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.580" end="01:21:44.690" style="s2">lot of these contexts we see much more</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.440" end="01:21:46.489" style="s2">interested in the public appearance of</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.690" end="01:21:48.920" style="s2">being loyal to some size than we care</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.489" end="01:21:50.780" style="s2">about actually making good choices that</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.920" end="01:21:54.350" style="s2">makes a lot of sense anything else you</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.780" end="01:21:57.530" style="s2">want to add about the book before we</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.350" end="01:21:59.810" style="s2">move on to our last topic well the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.530" end="01:22:01.670" style="s2">key message of our book for people who</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.810" end="01:22:03.410" style="s2">want to do institution design ever</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.670" end="01:22:05.300" style="s2">improving the world is to say the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.410" end="01:22:07.070" style="s2">problem is a little harder than you</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.300" end="01:22:08.690" style="s2">might have thought but there&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.070" end="01:22:10.010" style="s2">prospect that if you solve this harder</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.690" end="01:22:12.890" style="s2">problem you&#39;ll actually get some</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.010" end="01:22:14.719" style="s2">traction so today for example if you try</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.890" end="01:22:16.850" style="s2">to solve the education problem in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.719" end="01:22:19.010" style="s2">form of how can we get more students to</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.850" end="01:22:20.239" style="s2">learn more material faster you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.010" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">that we actually have a lot of solutions</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.239" end="01:22:24.469" style="s2">that we can identify them but nobody</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:26.929" style="s2">cares but if school is really about</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.469" end="01:22:29.270" style="s2">showing that you are smart and</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.929" end="01:22:31.280" style="s2">conscientious and conformist and things</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.270" end="01:22:33.500" style="s2">like that then you might have a better</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.280" end="01:22:34.850" style="s2">chance if you found a solution that let</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.500" end="01:22:36.440" style="s2">people show those things more</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.850" end="01:22:38.210" style="s2">effectively than they would be actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.440" end="01:22:41.179" style="s2">interested although they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.210" end="01:22:42.650" style="s2">want to continue to pretend to want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.179" end="01:22:44.989" style="s2">show that they are learning the material</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.650" end="01:22:46.910" style="s2">so because we are hypocritical because</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.989" end="01:22:48.320" style="s2">in each of these areas we have one thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.910" end="01:22:50.050" style="s2">we say we&#39;re trying to do it another</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.320" end="01:22:51.980" style="s2">thing we actually are trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.050" end="01:22:54.170" style="s2">reforms will also have to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.980" end="01:22:56.540" style="s2">hypocritical in that they will have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.170" end="01:22:57.710" style="s2">continue to let us pretend that we are</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.540" end="01:23:00.350" style="s2">trying to achieve the thing we were</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.710" end="01:23:02.330" style="s2">pretending to achieve but actually give</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.350" end="01:23:04.219" style="s2">us more of the things we really want so</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.330" end="01:23:07.910" style="s2">that we will actually be interested in</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.219" end="01:23:09.679" style="s2">adopting so that&#39;s the different</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.910" end="01:23:11.140" style="s2">perspective that I&#39;m hoping to pass on</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.679" end="01:23:14.719" style="s2">to social scientists and policymakers</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.140" end="01:23:16.610" style="s2">from my lifetime of experience which is</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.719" end="01:23:18.560" style="s2">if you reform the question that way</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.610" end="01:23:20.449" style="s2">you&#39;ll have a better chance of actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.560" end="01:23:22.340" style="s2">producing reforms that people want okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.449" end="01:23:24.860" style="s2">that makes a heck of a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.340" end="01:23:26.900" style="s2">actually though it does bring something</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.860" end="01:23:28.790" style="s2">pretty close to citizen into the design</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.900" end="01:23:31.610" style="s2">of our institutions the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.790" end="01:23:33.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a nominal reason learn something</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.610" end="01:23:35.900" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a real reason so that</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.830" end="01:23:37.940" style="s2">you&#39;re expired right right and it makes</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.900" end="01:23:40.250" style="s2">a plausible reason why you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.940" end="01:23:42.320" style="s2">fully honest about why you are proposing</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.250" end="01:23:43.940" style="s2">something and so it means that you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.320" end="01:23:45.469" style="s2">easily if other people are doing this</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.940" end="01:23:47.270" style="s2">you can accuse them of hypocrisy which</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.469" end="01:23:49.610" style="s2">is a terrible accusation usually in</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.270" end="01:23:50.620" style="s2">people try to deny it to they can accuse</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.610" end="01:23:51.610" style="s2">you of Apocrypha because</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.620" end="01:23:53.560" style="s2">if this is what you&#39;re doing you</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.610" end="01:23:55.030" style="s2">actually are being hypocritical in some</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.560" end="01:23:56.080" style="s2">sense because ordinary people are</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.030" end="01:23:58.450" style="s2">critical and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:23:59.770" style="s2">accommodate them unfortunately that</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.450" end="01:24:02.280" style="s2">seems to give rise to a defense</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.770" end="01:24:05.320" style="s2">mechanism within the system for</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.280" end="01:24:07.840" style="s2">inefficiency right if to actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.320" end="01:24:09.730" style="s2">address the reality immediately produces</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.840" end="01:24:12.340" style="s2">a reaction of the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.730" end="01:24:15.040" style="s2">hypocrisy it then becomes difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.340" end="01:24:16.570" style="s2">nudge the system towards reality or so</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.040" end="01:24:18.310" style="s2">the first thing to realize is all of</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.570" end="01:24:21.610" style="s2">these different systems are chock-full</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.310" end="01:24:23.140" style="s2">of enormous waste from the point of view</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.610" end="01:24:25.570" style="s2">of the thing we say we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.140" end="01:24:27.250" style="s2">achieve there&#39;s a vast potential for</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.570" end="01:24:29.230" style="s2">doing better and I&#39;ve asked</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.250" end="01:24:32.260" style="s2">unacknowledged and on you know used</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.230" end="01:24:34.720" style="s2">potential so it&#39;s far easier to figure</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.260" end="01:24:36.070" style="s2">out how to produce policies that would</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.720" end="01:24:37.690" style="s2">make things better than it is to get</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.070" end="01:24:39.880" style="s2">people to be interested in adopting them</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.690" end="01:24:41.500" style="s2">so the more fundamental problem in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.880" end="01:24:43.330" style="s2">world isn&#39;t how can we have a better</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.500" end="01:24:45.460" style="s2">world but is how can we make anybody</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.330" end="01:24:47.200" style="s2">care about having a better world yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.460" end="01:24:49.630" style="s2">seem to be this split is the reality of</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.200" end="01:24:52.560" style="s2">what they say they want is different</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.630" end="01:24:54.400" style="s2">from how they&#39;ll actually behave and</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.560" end="01:24:55.960" style="s2">unfortunately if you move to try to move</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.400" end="01:24:58.390" style="s2">the system towards how they&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.960" end="01:25:00.250" style="s2">behave you&#39;re immediately subject to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.390" end="01:25:03.160" style="s2">charge of hypocrisy because you have</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.250" end="01:25:05.560" style="s2">deviated from the stated social norm</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.160" end="01:25:07.630" style="s2">which is what happens if you admit your</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.560" end="01:25:09.850" style="s2">actual reason for making this proposal</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.630" end="01:25:11.740" style="s2">so and then he kept coming on another</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.850" end="01:25:13.480" style="s2">level of strategy right which is here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.740" end="01:25:15.430" style="s2">the reason but we have a differ here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.480" end="01:25:17.800" style="s2">the proposal but here&#39;s the reason which</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.430" end="01:25:19.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t the real reason right right now</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.800" end="01:25:22.180" style="s2">most people who are involved in politics</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.960" end="01:25:23.980" style="s2">and policy and social science know that</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.180" end="01:25:26.110" style="s2">in fact this is what actually typically</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.980" end="01:25:28.180" style="s2">happens most people who are making</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.110" end="01:25:29.860" style="s2">policy proposals do have hidden agendas</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.180" end="01:25:31.120" style="s2">and aren&#39;t willing to be fully honest</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.860" end="01:25:32.980" style="s2">about why they&#39;re making those proposals</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.120" end="01:25:34.690" style="s2">they know that&#39;s true about pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.980" end="01:25:36.190" style="s2">everybody and which they know that is</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.690" end="01:25:37.660" style="s2">true about the other side they focus on</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.190" end="01:25:39.040" style="s2">the other side and they know that those</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.660" end="01:25:41.170" style="s2">other people are hypocrites which all</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.040" end="01:25:44.410" style="s2">the more emboldened them to be outraged</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.170" end="01:25:45.610" style="s2">and indignant about the other side well</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.410" end="01:25:47.260" style="s2">so always good to know how a system</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.610" end="01:25:49.540" style="s2">works but I must say I don&#39;t take a</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.260" end="01:25:51.910" style="s2">tremendous amount of optimism about our</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.540" end="01:25:54.640" style="s2">current political process away from this</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.910" end="01:25:56.200" style="s2">knowledge so well but what it means is</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.640" end="01:25:57.910" style="s2">enormous potential is there for</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.200" end="01:25:59.710" style="s2">improvement if the system was really</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.910" end="01:26:01.750" style="s2">well optimized it would mean we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.710" end="01:26:03.460" style="s2">do much better when the system is really</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.750" end="01:26:03.920" style="s2">broken it means there&#39;s huge potential</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.460" end="01:26:06.050" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.920" end="01:26:08.150" style="s2">that is true but one of the best jobs I</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.050" end="01:26:09.620" style="s2">ever took was a really messed up company</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.150" end="01:26:12.230" style="s2">people said why&#39;d you do that I said</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.620" end="01:26:13.699" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a lot easier to fix a</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.230" end="01:26:15.679" style="s2">messed up company that is to build a</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.699" end="01:26:17.090" style="s2">good one or to improve a good one in</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.679" end="01:26:18.949" style="s2">order to improve a good one all right</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.090" end="01:26:20.510" style="s2">well let&#39;s move on to our last topic</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.949" end="01:26:24.020" style="s2">this has been such a great conversation</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.510" end="01:26:26.120" style="s2">and that is a article you put on your</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.020" end="01:26:29.660" style="s2">blog not too long ago about publishing</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.120" end="01:26:32.239" style="s2">tax returns that wasn&#39;t just a</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.660" end="01:26:34.670" style="s2">relatively small thought I had it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.239" end="01:26:36.860" style="s2">central to my thinking but I basically</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.670" end="01:26:39.530" style="s2">said why not publish tax returns as a</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.860" end="01:26:41.480" style="s2">way to make it easier to enforce tax law</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.530" end="01:26:44.210" style="s2">so if you&#39;re worried that people are</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.480" end="01:26:46.760" style="s2">cheating on their taxes more visible the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.210" end="01:26:48.949" style="s2">taxes are then the more other people who</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.760" end="01:26:50.870" style="s2">say saw their neighbor and how much tax</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.949" end="01:26:52.699" style="s2">they are paying and could look at the</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.870" end="01:26:55.160" style="s2">items would then be able to check that</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.699" end="01:26:57.650" style="s2">against what they saw and maybe call</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.160" end="01:26:59.810" style="s2"> when something didn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.650" end="01:27:01.940" style="s2">right so in some sense there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.810" end="01:27:03.560" style="s2">trade-off there between privacy how much</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.940" end="01:27:05.150" style="s2">you&#39;re going to allow each person to</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.560" end="01:27:08.719" style="s2">keep their taxes private and our</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.150" end="01:27:10.610" style="s2">enforcement of tax law what about other</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.719" end="01:27:12.290" style="s2">implications I read that and saw you had</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.610" end="01:27:14.030" style="s2">a relatively narrow argument but it</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.290" end="01:27:15.320" style="s2">immediately got me thinking you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.030" end="01:27:18.199" style="s2">what about things like for instance how</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.320" end="01:27:21.050" style="s2">much charity people would do if their</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.199" end="01:27:23.020" style="s2">tax return to Republic and especially</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.050" end="01:27:25.880" style="s2">going back your idea of signaling right</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.020" end="01:27:28.670" style="s2">if our tax returns Republic we might</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.880" end="01:27:31.280" style="s2">behave in different ways sure now it</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.670" end="01:27:33.170" style="s2">does come to this basic question of to</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.280" end="01:27:35.750" style="s2">what extent do you see social pressure</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.170" end="01:27:38.540" style="s2">and social visibility is good overall</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.750" end="01:27:40.910" style="s2">humans clearly evolved a system by which</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.540" end="01:27:42.739" style="s2">we have social disability and social</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.910" end="01:27:44.750" style="s2">pressure in order to induce better</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.739" end="01:27:47.030" style="s2">behavior but this is the whole concept</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.750" end="01:27:49.449" style="s2">of social norms long ago we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.030" end="01:27:52.160" style="s2">formal systems of law what we had is</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.449" end="01:27:54.380" style="s2">norms and the rules were if you saw</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.160" end="01:27:56.030" style="s2">somebody breaking a norm breaking a rule</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.380" end="01:27:58.429" style="s2">then you were supposed to tell everybody</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.030" end="01:27:59.570" style="s2">other people about it report on it then</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.429" end="01:28:01.070" style="s2">you were supposed to talk to them and</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.570" end="01:28:03.199" style="s2">coordinate with them about what to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.070" end="01:28:05.600" style="s2">about it which included threats of</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.199" end="01:28:07.160" style="s2">punishment punishment and escalations to</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.600" end="01:28:09.500" style="s2">continue to do something to get it to</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.160" end="01:28:11.360" style="s2">stop that is our ancient human heritage</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.500" end="01:28:14.120" style="s2">to have norms that we enforce in that</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.360" end="01:28:15.860" style="s2">way it&#39;s only in the last few ten</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.120" end="01:28:17.640" style="s2">thousand years that we&#39;ve had formal</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.860" end="01:28:20.280" style="s2">systems of law that did anything else</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.640" end="01:28:22.320" style="s2">than that and mostly formal systems Larr</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.280" end="01:28:24.240" style="s2">trying to more strongly and accurately</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.320" end="01:28:27.150" style="s2">enforce these norms that we developed</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.240" end="01:28:29.610" style="s2">before so if you approve of this general</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.150" end="01:28:31.560" style="s2">norm based system then you like the idea</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.610" end="01:28:33.750" style="s2">that you could make the behavior more</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.560" end="01:28:35.370" style="s2">visible which would then make other</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.750" end="01:28:37.140" style="s2">people be able to shame you or</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.370" end="01:28:38.940" style="s2">disapprove if that you were violating a</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.140" end="01:28:40.860" style="s2">norm and then exert more pressure on you</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.940" end="01:28:42.780" style="s2">to behave better now how many people</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.860" end="01:28:44.970" style="s2">have come to the opinion lately that</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.780" end="01:28:47.220" style="s2">norm enforcement is bad that we should</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.970" end="01:28:48.960" style="s2">not be having norms and force that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.220" end="01:28:50.880" style="s2">should instead create a system where</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.960" end="01:28:52.290" style="s2">people can do things privately in a ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.880" end="01:28:54.090" style="s2">that are not visible and that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.290" end="01:28:55.470" style="s2">better world where other people are not</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.090" end="01:28:58.140" style="s2">getting involved in their business and</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.470" end="01:29:00.900" style="s2">so if true that means that norms have</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.140" end="01:29:02.310" style="s2">gone really wrong somehow somehow once</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.900" end="01:29:04.440" style="s2">upon time norms were effective and</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.310" end="01:29:06.840" style="s2">useful and now norms are just broken and</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.440" end="01:29:10.530" style="s2">of course often people want to make a</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.840" end="01:29:12.420" style="s2">norm about that that is they create and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.530" end="01:29:15.000" style="s2">enforce a norm that you shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.420" end="01:29:17.100" style="s2">other norms or that certain norms are</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.000" end="01:29:19.200" style="s2">inappropriate that&#39;s part of the modern</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.100" end="01:29:21.480" style="s2">world discussion is when it would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.200" end="01:29:23.580" style="s2">okay to have norms a lot of research has</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.480" end="01:29:25.710" style="s2">been done including some mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.580" end="01:29:28.320" style="s2">simulations by some folks that are Santa</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.710" end="01:29:30.210" style="s2">Fe Institute indicate that it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.320" end="01:29:32.490" style="s2">hard to have norm survive without</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.210" end="01:29:34.320" style="s2">enforcement absolutely so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.490" end="01:29:36.450" style="s2">gonna have norms be followed if they</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.320" end="01:29:38.130" style="s2">aren&#39;t enforced and so the key question</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.450" end="01:29:39.570" style="s2">is do you want norms being followed</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.130" end="01:29:41.010" style="s2">there have been norms and societies in</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.570" end="01:29:42.930" style="s2">the past that people have disapproved of</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.010" end="01:29:44.340" style="s2">those particular norms for example</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.930" end="01:29:47.310" style="s2">they&#39;ve been norms against homosexuality</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.340" end="01:29:48.510" style="s2">and those norms were enforced and people</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.310" end="01:29:50.100" style="s2">today have come to the opinion that</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.510" end="01:29:52.320" style="s2">those were bad norms and it was bad to</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.100" end="01:29:53.880" style="s2">enforce them and then they jump from</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.320" end="01:29:57.510" style="s2">that to the idea that it would be bad to</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.880" end="01:29:59.940" style="s2">enforce all norms it&#39;s related to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.510" end="01:30:01.710" style="s2">issue of blackmail actually which is a</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.940" end="01:30:03.360" style="s2">fun topic that I&#39;ve talked on the blog a</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.710" end="01:30:06.060" style="s2">couple times in the last year because</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.360" end="01:30:08.310" style="s2">arguably blackmail is a way to enforce</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.060" end="01:30:10.140" style="s2">norms that is if there&#39;s a thing that if</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.310" end="01:30:11.580" style="s2">it were known you wouldn&#39;t like it to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.140" end="01:30:14.430" style="s2">known because people would treat yours</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.580" end="01:30:15.690" style="s2">blackmail induces the threat of making</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.430" end="01:30:18.000" style="s2">that be known and punishes you for</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.690" end="01:30:18.660" style="s2">behaving in ways that that&#39;s right would</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.000" end="01:30:20.220" style="s2">be effective</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.660" end="01:30:23.340" style="s2">so in some sense when you allow</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.220" end="01:30:25.860" style="s2">blackmail will allow people to enforce</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.340" end="01:30:27.240" style="s2">the norms against whatever behavior you</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.860" end="01:30:28.980" style="s2">would do that would you wouldn&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.240" end="01:30:29.800" style="s2">be known and then many people think well</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.980" end="01:30:31.659" style="s2">that&#39;s bad that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.800" end="01:30:33.429" style="s2">blackmail because it&#39;s bad to enforce</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.659" end="01:30:35.980" style="s2">those norms such as for example</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.429" end="01:30:37.840" style="s2">homosexuality in the past gotcha</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.980" end="01:30:41.320" style="s2">though we then we get to an issue that</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.840" end="01:30:43.630" style="s2">if we have nihilism about norms or</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.320" end="01:30:45.250" style="s2">nihilism about enforcement we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.630" end="01:30:47.650" style="s2">essentially said we&#39;ve abandoned all of</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.250" end="01:30:49.239" style="s2">our norms right so some people say well</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.650" end="01:30:52.389" style="s2">now that we have law we don&#39;t need norms</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.239" end="01:30:54.250" style="s2">anymore although then they have norms</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.389" end="01:30:55.480" style="s2">about which laws we should have and of</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.250" end="01:30:58.000" style="s2">course norms about which laws should be</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.480" end="01:30:59.949" style="s2">enforced so for example the recent me to</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.000" end="01:31:02.139" style="s2">discussion is about the norm against</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.949" end="01:31:03.760" style="s2">behavior not only behavior the someone</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.139" end="01:31:05.739" style="s2">which is illegal but they want the norm</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.760" end="01:31:07.179" style="s2">to be enforced that more sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.739" end="01:31:08.619" style="s2">behavior like that should be illegal and</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.179" end="01:31:11.050" style="s2">even when it&#39;s not illegal it should be</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.619" end="01:31:14.079" style="s2">disapproved and that&#39;s an attempt to use</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.050" end="01:31:17.079" style="s2">norms to enforce concept of good</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.079" end="01:31:18.880" style="s2">behavior and bad behavior and it make</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.079" end="01:31:20.230" style="s2">sense if we agree that that is bad</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.880" end="01:31:22.780" style="s2">behavior which I certainly would agree</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.230" end="01:31:24.550" style="s2">so a specially important thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.780" end="01:31:27.010" style="s2">we&#39;ve seemed to have weakened our norms</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.550" end="01:31:29.469" style="s2">for supporting law you know in the past</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.010" end="01:31:31.239" style="s2">there usually were strong norms in any</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.469" end="01:31:33.520" style="s2">given geographic area that if you saw</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.239" end="01:31:36.010" style="s2">illegal behavior you should report it</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.520" end="01:31:38.530" style="s2">and you should assist in reporting and</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.010" end="01:31:40.480" style="s2">preventing and inducing the formal law</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.530" end="01:31:42.909" style="s2">enforcement apparatus to come to play</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.480" end="01:31:44.710" style="s2">and more recently we often have</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.909" end="01:31:46.780" style="s2">communities where in the local</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.710" end="01:31:48.040" style="s2">communities norms there&#39;s no particular</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.780" end="01:31:49.420" style="s2">thing you&#39;re supposed to do when you see</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.040" end="01:31:50.800" style="s2">illegal behavior it&#39;s up to the police</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.420" end="01:31:51.940" style="s2">to find it and catch it but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.800" end="01:31:54.159" style="s2">supposed to help there&#39;s no obligation</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.940" end="01:31:55.599" style="s2">you have to help and in fact often you</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.159" end="01:31:57.520" style="s2">feel you have an obligation to not else</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.599" end="01:31:59.829" style="s2">because you see the police for example</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.520" end="01:32:02.469" style="s2">as an outside occupying force that are</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.829" end="01:32:04.630" style="s2">not supporting a community so when you</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.469" end="01:32:06.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have a norm of supporting law laws</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.630" end="01:32:08.050" style="s2">of course much weaker and much less</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.520" end="01:32:11.099" style="s2">effective and so then you might not have</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.050" end="01:32:14.170" style="s2">norms or laws presumably you&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.099" end="01:32:15.760" style="s2">much less strong society right your</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.170" end="01:32:18.369" style="s2">coherence as a society will be</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.760" end="01:32:20.170" style="s2">substantially weakened but again from</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.369" end="01:32:22.119" style="s2">the usual broadest perspective we say</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.170" end="01:32:24.280" style="s2">you know norms and then law were an</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.119" end="01:32:26.500" style="s2">important tools that societies had for</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.280" end="01:32:28.929" style="s2">discouraging bad behavior and producing</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.500" end="01:32:30.880" style="s2">better behavior but from some</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.929" end="01:32:32.230" style="s2">perspectives they say well that may have</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.880" end="01:32:34.929" style="s2">been what&#39;s been true but it isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.230" end="01:32:37.210" style="s2">now and therefore they say norms are now</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.929" end="01:32:38.800" style="s2">just things better off not enforced and</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.210" end="01:32:40.250" style="s2">even many of them think laws are things</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.800" end="01:32:41.960" style="s2">better off not enforce there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.250" end="01:32:44.060" style="s2">intention of people who think a stronger</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.960" end="01:32:45.860" style="s2">law enforcement is a bad idea because we</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.060" end="01:32:47.660" style="s2">have so many bad laws than enforcing the</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.860" end="01:32:49.010" style="s2">laws that and you know if that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.660" end="01:32:51.320" style="s2">that means we have a pretty desperate</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.010" end="01:32:53.450" style="s2">sound situations that we no longer have</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.320" end="01:32:54.950" style="s2">norms or laws available to us as a way</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.450" end="01:32:56.600" style="s2">to enforce good behavior because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.950" end="01:32:59.390" style="s2">a lot of bad behavior that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.600" end="01:33:01.730" style="s2">and that might well grow if it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.390" end="01:33:04.160" style="s2">scourge yeah from any evolutionary game</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.730" end="01:33:07.340" style="s2">theory perspective we know that systems</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.160" end="01:33:09.430" style="s2">are easily available by freeriders and</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.340" end="01:33:12.020" style="s2">by other kinds of malicious strategies</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.430" end="01:33:14.510" style="s2">again and again and work by guys like</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.020" end="01:33:17.450" style="s2">Sam Boles and herb dentists on some of</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.510" end="01:33:18.890" style="s2">these simple social exchange games show</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.450" end="01:33:21.650" style="s2">that without the ability to enforce</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.890" end="01:33:25.100" style="s2">norms there&#39;s a large tendency for</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.650" end="01:33:27.710" style="s2">people to retreat to a series of far</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.100" end="01:33:29.270" style="s2">from optimal strategies so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.710" end="01:33:31.340" style="s2">especially interested lately in ways to</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.270" end="01:33:34.280" style="s2">reform criminal law enforcement and</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.340" end="01:33:36.440" style="s2">punishment exactly because if you assume</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.280" end="01:33:38.960" style="s2">that on average criminal law is a good</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.440" end="01:33:40.540" style="s2">idea then on average would be good to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.960" end="01:33:42.860" style="s2">more effective at enforcing that and</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.540" end="01:33:44.360" style="s2">arguably our current system is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.860" end="01:33:46.520" style="s2">awkward and inefficient</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.360" end="01:33:48.650" style="s2">doing those sorts of things and unfair</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.520" end="01:33:50.480" style="s2">in many ways but that is all based on</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.650" end="01:33:52.040" style="s2">the idea that it&#39;s better to have</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.480" end="01:33:53.300" style="s2">criminal law than not to have it and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.040" end="01:33:55.430" style="s2">same is true for norm enforcement</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.300" end="01:33:56.840" style="s2">blackmail is good if the typical norms</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.430" end="01:33:59.300" style="s2">that would be enforced by blackmail are</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.840" end="01:34:01.040" style="s2">good but not otherwise what are some of</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.300" end="01:34:03.380" style="s2">the ideas in the criminal justice area</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.040" end="01:34:04.790" style="s2">well I&#39;ve got this package that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.380" end="01:34:07.190" style="s2">kind of radical but I&#39;m even thinking</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.790" end="01:34:09.800" style="s2">writing a book on it to combine a bounty</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.190" end="01:34:12.740" style="s2">insured fine system to basically</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.800" end="01:34:15.800" style="s2">privatize the punishment and enforcement</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.740" end="01:34:17.750" style="s2">of crime but still have the same social</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.800" end="01:34:20.660" style="s2">choice of what is a crime and whether</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.750" end="01:34:22.160" style="s2">anyone act as a crime so the bound of</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.660" end="01:34:23.990" style="s2">the proposals will leave in place</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.160" end="01:34:26.780" style="s2">whatever systems we have for deciding</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.990" end="01:34:28.880" style="s2">which acts are crimes and how how severe</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.780" end="01:34:30.440" style="s2">any one act is as a crime in terms of a</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.880" end="01:34:32.060" style="s2">type of fact and then whether there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.440" end="01:34:34.310" style="s2">accusation about any one person having</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.060" end="01:34:36.020" style="s2">committed one of these acts leave alone</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.310" end="01:34:38.030" style="s2">the process for deciding whether that</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.020" end="01:34:40.220" style="s2">accusation is correct okay so for</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.030" end="01:34:42.560" style="s2">instance we let&#39;s say we still are of a</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.220" end="01:34:45.200" style="s2">law against armed robbery we&#39;ve won a</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.560" end="01:34:48.320" style="s2">pretty strong sanction on it we put a</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.200" end="01:34:51.380" style="s2">bounty on people who apprehend armed</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.320" end="01:34:52.560" style="s2">robbers so we put two numbers on each</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.380" end="01:34:54.000" style="s2">crime so same</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.560" end="01:34:55.830" style="s2">armed robbery of a certain source we</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.000" end="01:34:58.140" style="s2">could bury armed robbery say whether it</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.830" end="01:34:59.400" style="s2">was you know violent or nonviolent with</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.140" end="01:35:00.690" style="s2">the gun or not you could vary the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.400" end="01:35:02.070" style="s2">punishment for different versions of</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.690" end="01:35:04.170" style="s2">armed robbery but for whichever version</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.070" end="01:35:06.420" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about with society would</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.170" end="01:35:09.390" style="s2">put two numbers on that crime it would</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.420" end="01:35:12.000" style="s2">put a bounty I how hard should people</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.390" end="01:35:14.730" style="s2">try to catch it and will put a fine</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.000" end="01:35:16.980" style="s2">which is how much should it be punished</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.730" end="01:35:19.680" style="s2">when it&#39;s caught and those would be the</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.980" end="01:35:21.870" style="s2">two key numbers that would the society</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.680" end="01:35:24.450" style="s2">would decide about each crime and now</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.870" end="01:35:25.590" style="s2">there&#39;d be a private system by which say</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.450" end="01:35:27.390" style="s2">a bounty hunter would go look for</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.590" end="01:35:29.460" style="s2">evidence to accuse any one person and</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.390" end="01:35:31.500" style="s2">then go to court and try to convince a</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.460" end="01:35:33.240" style="s2">court of that and then if they convince</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.500" end="01:35:35.790" style="s2">the court they will receive a certain</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.240" end="01:35:38.310" style="s2">bounty and then that person will suffer</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.790" end="01:35:40.830" style="s2">a certain fine now in the past we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.310" end="01:35:43.110" style="s2">tended not to use fines for big crimes</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.830" end="01:35:46.320" style="s2">because most people can&#39;t pay really big</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.110" end="01:35:48.270" style="s2">fines so the innovation here is to make</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.320" end="01:35:50.370" style="s2">it more like our system for automobile</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.270" end="01:35:51.750" style="s2">insurance so today you&#39;re not allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.370" end="01:35:53.880" style="s2">drive on the road unless you have</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.750" end="01:35:55.620" style="s2">insurance that covers for an accident</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.880" end="01:35:56.450" style="s2">and so the idea would be to do that for</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.620" end="01:35:58.980" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.450" end="01:36:00.930" style="s2">crime insurance for everything or even</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.980" end="01:36:03.150" style="s2">lawsuit insurance for everything you</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.930" end="01:36:05.970" style="s2">must have an insurer who backs you to a</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.150" end="01:36:09.240" style="s2">large amount say the 90th percentile of</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.970" end="01:36:11.130" style="s2">awards such that if you are found guilty</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.240" end="01:36:13.590" style="s2">of that they will pay this amount on</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.130" end="01:36:16.320" style="s2">your behalf and if we can do that now</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.590" end="01:36:19.020" style="s2">you and your insurer internalize the</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.320" end="01:36:21.150" style="s2">issues of how to punish how to monitor</p>
