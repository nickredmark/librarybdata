<p begin="00:01:49.700" end="00:01:58.490" style="s2">we spaces but we&#39;re going to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.590" end="00:02:00.670" style="s2">one questions through one particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.490" end="00:02:04.660" style="s2">part of the work that I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.670" end="00:02:09.080" style="s2">in sharing with the integral people</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.660" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">which is nootropics and complex medicine</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.080" end="00:02:15.470" style="s2">science will rephrase that but then</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:20.420" style="s2">we&#39;ll be going and navigating into</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.470" end="00:02:24.920" style="s2">different types of things that will open</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.420" end="00:02:27.260" style="s2">up but all directed into sensing what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.920" end="00:02:30.250" style="s2">that we need to do in this moment where</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.260" end="00:02:33.170" style="s2">are the practical steps where are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.250" end="00:02:36.530" style="s2">actions activities what is happening the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:38.870" style="s2">world that can inform us what what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.530" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">can do in this moment of transition what</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.870" end="00:02:44.390" style="s2">we can do to develop higher ways and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:48.680" style="s2">better senses who we are together as</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.390" end="00:02:50.780" style="s2">collective so high they know Efrain on</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.680" end="00:02:54.890" style="s2">this happy to be here thank you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.780" end="00:02:57.640" style="s2">I&#39;m delighted to have you here today so</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.890" end="00:03:03.650" style="s2">as I mentioned I want to have like one</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.640" end="00:03:07.730" style="s2">entry point question for us to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.650" end="00:03:10.189" style="s2">with around nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.730" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">and around the the work that you do in</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.189" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">the neuro hacker collective a but first</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:16.770" style="s2">perhaps the first question is can you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">tell us what the tropics are so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.770" end="00:03:24.630" style="s2">people just like can&#39;t understand sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:28.770" style="s2">why it&#39;s important yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:32.300" style="s2">tropics are chemicals that enhance some</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.770" end="00:03:35.010" style="s2">aspect of cognitive function the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.300" end="00:03:37.370" style="s2">formal best definition of no tropics is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.010" end="00:03:40.320" style="s2">any chemical that can enhance some</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.370" end="00:03:43.140" style="s2">aspect of cognitive function like memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.320" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">or focus or herbal fluency or pattern</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.140" end="00:03:48.510" style="s2">recognition beyond someone&#39;s normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:50.670" style="s2">baseline without meaningful negative</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:53.070" style="s2">side effects and so this is in Contra</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.670" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">distinction to brain nutrients which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.070" end="00:03:57.660" style="s2">all the vitamins minerals amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:03:59.210" style="s2">fatty acids that brain just naturally</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.660" end="00:04:01.350" style="s2">needs your nervous system and whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.210" end="00:04:02.940" style="s2">factory embodied cognition a whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.350" end="00:04:05.610" style="s2">physiology needs to be able to process</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.940" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">information well those aren&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.610" end="00:04:09.180" style="s2">really elevate capacity beyond baseline</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:10.650" style="s2">they&#39;re just gonna bring you back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.180" end="00:04:12.030" style="s2">baseline if there&#39;s deficiency because</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.650" end="00:04:14.550" style="s2">those are really part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.030" end="00:04:17.010" style="s2">evolutionary environment right so brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.550" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">nutrients are foundational things and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.010" end="00:04:20.760" style="s2">then what we think of as smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:23.880" style="s2">which are usually pharmaceuticals that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:25.830" style="s2">are for a TD or sometimes narcolepsy or</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.880" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">sometimes neurodegenerative diseases</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.830" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">that can enhance some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:34.680" style="s2">cognitive function but usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:36.570" style="s2">fairly narrow and usually it&#39;s with some</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.680" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">side effects so this is adderall</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.570" end="00:04:40.260" style="s2">modafinil</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.660" style="s2">vyvanse Ritalin you know those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.260" end="00:04:44.640" style="s2">psychostimulants psych meds and many</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.660" end="00:04:45.780" style="s2">other things so you know tropics or this</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.640" end="00:04:48.419" style="s2">kind of interesting category that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.780" end="00:04:50.550" style="s2">trying to see if we can elevate aspects</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.419" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">of cognitive and then more widely also</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.550" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">psycho cognitive function from a neuro</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:59.669" style="s2">physiological you know biochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:01.950" style="s2">perspective and if we can do it without</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.669" end="00:05:03.870" style="s2">negative side effects any even ideally</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.950" end="00:05:05.510" style="s2">with lasting benefits so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.870" end="00:05:06.690" style="s2">the field and why it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.510" end="00:05:08.730" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.690" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">yes for me it&#39;s really interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.730" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">started to do a research similar to dial</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:16.470" style="s2">back in the late 90s before red wool or</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:18.330" style="s2">those were getting companies and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.470" end="00:05:20.640" style="s2">started to use like water or not and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.330" end="00:05:22.890" style="s2">started to use like ginkgo biloba and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.640" end="00:05:24.870" style="s2">things like that and just like notice</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.890" end="00:05:26.370" style="s2">what happened to me what happened to us</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.870" end="00:05:29.760" style="s2">to my name or what happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.370" end="00:05:31.770" style="s2">rest of my possibility to focus and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.760" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">was really interesting and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.770" end="00:05:35.370" style="s2">you&#39;ve been developing a product when</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">the product is out and I&#39;ve been testing</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.370" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">that and I really really enjoy it I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:44.340" style="s2">tell you many different experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:46.500" style="s2">I had who with with while yet but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.340" end="00:05:48.660" style="s2">not the point for the conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:52.949" style="s2">the partner that I want to enter into is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.660" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">do these I understand that that by using</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.949" end="00:06:00.389" style="s2">nootropics we can enhance our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:06:04.199" style="s2">function but have you used it or have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.389" end="00:06:06.870" style="s2">you experienced what does it create when</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.199" end="00:06:09.389" style="s2">when a certain group of people do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.870" end="00:06:14.010" style="s2">together the SID and hence the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.389" end="00:06:18.030" style="s2">collective capacity it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.010" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">question so when we think of chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.030" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">and we think of affecting neuro</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.080" end="00:06:22.320" style="s2">chemistry in a way that&#39;s gonna affect</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">people&#39;s psyches they&#39;re gonna affect</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.320" end="00:06:27.060" style="s2">them in our personally in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:30.570" style="s2">positive experiences we usually think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.060" end="00:06:34.710" style="s2">in pathogens right so we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.570" end="00:06:36.139" style="s2">about on the very mild side so many</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.710" end="00:06:38.820" style="s2">reasons that people come together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.139" end="00:06:40.830" style="s2">drink alcohol together or use marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.820" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">together is because they get to access</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.830" end="00:06:44.760" style="s2">some shared state of experience and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.889" style="s2">maybe one that decreases inhibitions or</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.760" end="00:06:49.139" style="s2">decreases anxiety and allows for some</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.889" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">increased bandwidth of connectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.139" end="00:06:58.349" style="s2">then deeper than that is things like</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">MDMA MDA other usually phenethylamine</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.349" end="00:07:03.470" style="s2">some tripped means some other categories</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">of psychedelic but that are specifically</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.470" end="00:07:10.349" style="s2">empathy increasing that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:12.419" style="s2">relationship increasing in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.349" end="00:07:14.250" style="s2">neuro chemistry they affect which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.419" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">almost exactly opposite to it usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.250" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">happens with the no tropic class of</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:25.380" style="s2">tropics but smart drugs again most</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.430" end="00:07:27.539" style="s2">people are taking smart drugs for pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.380" end="00:07:29.880" style="s2">individualistic purposes right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.539" end="00:07:31.530" style="s2">having a hard time focusing and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.530" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">to they want to increase their creative</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.550" end="00:07:46.170" style="s2">federal works for that you know it as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.530" end="00:07:47.750" style="s2">dopamine agonist will increase focus and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.170" end="00:07:50.510" style="s2">will increase motivation now</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.750" end="00:07:54.420" style="s2">unfortunately as a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.510" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">exogenous dopamine agonist it also means</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.420" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">that if you use that for a while it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:08:00.030" style="s2">going to decrease your own endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:04.140" style="s2">dopamine regulatory process which means</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.030" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">addiction and memories really not</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.140" end="00:08:09.540" style="s2">primarily dopamine mediated its</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:11.760" style="s2">acetylcholine and and you know many</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.760" end="00:08:16.680" style="s2">involved and other catecholamines are</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.650" end="00:08:20.450" style="s2">involved so that the brain is a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.680" end="00:08:24.690" style="s2">complex organ right and the brain</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.690" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">complex as a whole complex of complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.030" end="00:08:31.140" style="s2">systems and when we&#39;re especially</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">dealing with not just human physiology</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.140" end="00:08:35.490" style="s2">but we&#39;re dealing with kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:37.320" style="s2">psychiatry or psycho neural interface</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.490" end="00:08:39.210" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the way that the upper</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.320" end="00:08:40.830" style="s2">right quadrant affects the other left</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.210" end="00:08:43.830" style="s2">right we could look at the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.830" end="00:08:46.470" style="s2">the way mindfulness and phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.830" end="00:08:48.570" style="s2">in the upper left affect you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.470" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">upper right but typically when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.570" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">thinking of the psychiatry direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:54.570" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the effect of body on</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:56.130" style="s2">mine this is a really tricky thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.570" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">from an epistemology point of view</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.130" end="00:08:59.160" style="s2">because not only do we have to factor</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:01.530" style="s2">complex systems and many different</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.160" end="00:09:03.930" style="s2">complex systems got brain access and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.530" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">methylation and genomics and head trauma</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.930" end="00:09:08.610" style="s2">and so many things but we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:10.140" style="s2">factor across the best technologic</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.610" end="00:09:12.840" style="s2">categories right how do we assess</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.140" end="00:09:14.810" style="s2">causation of something rising in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.840" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">consciousness from something arising in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.810" end="00:09:21.210" style="s2">Physiology without reducing one quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:24.030" style="s2">to the other so we causation isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.210" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">adequate way of thinking about it but so</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.030" end="00:09:27.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of reasons that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:29.460" style="s2">field of psychiatry and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.540" end="00:09:32.130" style="s2">psychopharmacology are just profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.460" end="00:09:35.520" style="s2">in how to quit to the scope of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.130" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">actual Sneed&#39;s of that space into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.520" end="00:09:41.370" style="s2">ontology of how the space works but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:43.020" style="s2">know because we&#39;re typically with</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.370" end="00:09:45.210" style="s2">psychostimulants were that people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.020" end="00:09:46.440" style="s2">taking or non-potable effects they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.210" end="00:09:49.740" style="s2">going to be affecting a pretty narrow</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.440" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">bandwidth of things they&#39;re usually</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.740" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">actually things that decrease empathy</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:57.790" style="s2">if you drive dopamine and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:09:59.830" style="s2">going to turn into increased</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.790" end="00:10:01.690" style="s2">norepinephrine and epinephrine you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.830" end="00:10:04.150" style="s2">move into a more sympathetic less</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.690" end="00:10:06.250" style="s2">parasympathetic place and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.150" end="00:10:09.010" style="s2">common experiences that people have when</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.250" end="00:10:11.410" style="s2">they&#39;re on psychostimulants for</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.010" end="00:10:13.330" style="s2">increased productivity is as they get</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.410" end="00:10:14.980" style="s2">more frustrated when someone interrupts</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.330" end="00:10:18.190" style="s2">them and they have to do task switching</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.980" end="00:10:20.440" style="s2">they have less empathy and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.190" end="00:10:24.580" style="s2">even depersonalization or D realization</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.440" end="00:10:27.730" style="s2">and so one of our main goals was can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.580" end="00:10:30.030" style="s2">increase can we support increasing focus</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.730" end="00:10:32.770" style="s2">and attention and concentration and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.030" end="00:10:35.670" style="s2">memory and pattern recognition and those</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.770" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">kinds of cognitive traits without</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.670" end="00:10:40.360" style="s2">negatively affecting their psychosocial</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.550" style="s2">and maybe even positively affecting it</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.360" end="00:10:45.310" style="s2">so this was like one of our our big</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.550" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">goals and if you think about it as how</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.310" end="00:10:49.750" style="s2">to affect both sides of the meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:52.120" style="s2">dialectics at once more ability to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.750" end="00:10:54.940" style="s2">intensely focus and better task</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.120" end="00:10:57.130" style="s2">switching those are very very different</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.940" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">tracks and so then we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.130" end="00:11:00.310" style="s2">about a brain that&#39;s more optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">one or the other or a psyche that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.310" end="00:11:03.100" style="s2">optimized for one of the other we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:06.370" style="s2">talking about a more adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.100" end="00:11:10.390" style="s2">they can actually respond adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.370" end="00:11:12.340" style="s2">environment needs know so we that was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.390" end="00:11:15.910" style="s2">really interesting deep dive for us to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.340" end="00:11:17.950" style="s2">look at the chemistry and the neurology</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.910" end="00:11:19.420" style="s2">that was associated with very different</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.950" end="00:11:24.340" style="s2">types of cognitive and psychomotor</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.420" end="00:11:26.500" style="s2">states and see how can we seek to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.340" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">benefit the adaptive capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.500" end="00:11:31.030" style="s2">whole system the endogenous regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:34.210" style="s2">capacity of the whole system and across</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.030" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">those kind of dialectic differences and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.210" end="00:11:40.230" style="s2">has it been in your experience like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:43.540" style="s2">stories of of success what have you been</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.230" end="00:11:47.320" style="s2">observing in your big site you know in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.540" end="00:11:49.900" style="s2">your own experience of course well I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.320" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">mean so with with this product that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.900" end="00:11:52.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to bring to a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:55.750" style="s2">now qualia we have a pretty meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.960" end="00:11:57.970" style="s2">amount of data that&#39;s come back to us</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.750" end="00:12:00.310" style="s2">mm-hm and one of the things that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.970" end="00:12:02.950" style="s2">of people have reported is increased</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.310" end="00:12:05.260" style="s2">empathy increased vicarious experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.950" end="00:12:06.130" style="s2">increased social intelligence social</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.260" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.130" end="00:12:12.370" style="s2">and a lot of decrease of inner anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.300" end="00:12:14.530" style="s2">inner critic that damages people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.370" end="00:12:16.690" style="s2">social capacity right that has them so</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.530" end="00:12:18.460" style="s2">caught in internal loop that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.690" end="00:12:21.460" style="s2">actually have less capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.460" end="00:12:24.040" style="s2">pay attention to other people rather</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.460" end="00:12:27.370" style="s2">than project possible triggers on other</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.040" end="00:12:28.900" style="s2">people and so even though that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.370" end="00:12:30.340" style="s2">what it was designed for it was a design</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.900" end="00:12:32.080" style="s2">constraint we were hoping it would move</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.340" end="00:12:34.570" style="s2">in the direction of it&#39;s been beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.080" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">to see that that&#39;s actually been the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.570" end="00:12:40.330" style="s2">experience of many people especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:41.740" style="s2">factoring that usually the processes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.330" end="00:12:47.530" style="s2">derived cognitive chemistry did the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.740" end="00:12:50.470" style="s2">opposite that&#39;s interesting yeah I use</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.530" end="00:12:52.900" style="s2">it once for for going into a keynote and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.470" end="00:12:54.820" style="s2">that I did a presentation and I was so</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.900" end="00:12:58.840" style="s2">happy that they first I was so exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.820" end="00:13:01.750" style="s2">the day before and then that day I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.840" end="00:13:04.890" style="s2">so on and then I felt so happy I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.750" end="00:13:09.430" style="s2">really literally feeling a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.890" end="00:13:10.750" style="s2">connection with people and very aware as</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.430" end="00:13:14.680" style="s2">you said like there&#39;s a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.750" end="00:13:17.020" style="s2">form of presence that happens so I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.680" end="00:13:19.900" style="s2">that there could be a lot of research</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.020" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">that can be done around what happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.900" end="00:13:26.470" style="s2">when we intentionally go into the space</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:30.130" style="s2">as individuals to create a specific way</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.470" end="00:13:33.310" style="s2">space while empowering ourselves or</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.130" end="00:13:35.730" style="s2">enhancing ourselves through the use of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.310" end="00:13:38.440" style="s2">nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.730" end="00:13:40.390" style="s2">so that that would be interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.440" end="00:13:42.040" style="s2">speaking about pattern recognition but</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.390" end="00:13:45.580" style="s2">in a collective I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.040" end="00:13:46.660" style="s2">definitely see that pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.580" end="00:13:48.910" style="s2">there&#39;s something fun that you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.660" end="00:13:51.870" style="s2">which is you know when we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.910" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">pharmacology of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.870" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">pattern recognition is significantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">mediated by dopamine right so when we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:00.970" style="s2">get excessive dopamine we get</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:04.080" style="s2">schizophrenia and see patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.970" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">aren&#39;t there and I mean that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.460" end="00:16:28.640" style="s2">moving on rapidly there&#39;s this really</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.300" end="00:16:30.350" style="s2">fun chemical that is in Phase two</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.640" end="00:16:32.120" style="s2">clinical trials for major depressive</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.470" end="00:16:41.290" style="s2">and it is basically a neurogenic this</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.650" end="00:16:43.820" style="s2">company neural stem started out doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.290" end="00:16:45.230" style="s2">ALS work and they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.820" end="00:16:46.610" style="s2">developing neural stem cells and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.230" end="00:16:49.730" style="s2">injecting them they were also going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.610" end="00:16:51.860" style="s2">do spinal cord injuries and they started</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.730" end="00:16:53.690" style="s2">looking for small molecules that could</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.860" end="00:16:55.130" style="s2">actually increase the proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.690" end="00:16:57.410" style="s2">the neural stem cells and they found</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.130" end="00:16:59.210" style="s2">about six that did and then an SI 189</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.410" end="00:17:00.950" style="s2">was their best shot and so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.210" end="00:17:03.170" style="s2">have to actually put the stem cells in</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.950" end="00:17:06.200" style="s2">they can use the small molecule orally</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.170" end="00:17:08.360" style="s2">and the body&#39;s own process of creating</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.200" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">you know of neurogenesis creating new</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.360" end="00:17:12.260" style="s2">neurons and hippocampus then they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:14.180" style="s2">move throughout anywhere in the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.260" end="00:17:16.130" style="s2">system is just increased this is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.180" end="00:17:18.260" style="s2">super interesting there&#39;s a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.130" end="00:17:19.670" style="s2">that you can increase neurogenesis but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.260" end="00:17:22.820" style="s2">this is actually a drug that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.670" end="00:17:25.310" style="s2">far along and even those for ALS to</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.820" end="00:17:27.560" style="s2">begin with and it was for then you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.310" end="00:17:30.440" style="s2">starting to look at actually repairing</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.560" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">damaged nervous system either from</p>

<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:35.990" style="s2">reason it&#39;s curing major depressive</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.340" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">disorder their hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.990" end="00:17:39.410" style="s2">they&#39;re actually seeing increased</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.340" end="00:17:48.020" style="s2">seeing decreased depression they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.800" end="00:17:50.090" style="s2">actually seeing the depression as an</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.020" end="00:17:52.280" style="s2">inability to process the total amount of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.090" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">emotional information within is coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.280" end="00:17:56.060" style="s2">and that as they can actually process</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:57.860" style="s2">the information better they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.060" end="00:17:59.960" style="s2">find solutions and conclusions and not</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.860" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">be overwhelmed and you know left in</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.960" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">those those emotional places and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:06.800" style="s2">a number of other techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:08.600" style="s2">processes that work through neurogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.800" end="00:18:10.070" style="s2">that are finding this so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.600" end="00:18:12.890" style="s2">interesting of like increased</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.070" end="00:18:14.630" style="s2">information processing capacity not</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.890" end="00:18:16.010" style="s2">being just a cognate thing but being</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.630" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">very related to emotion which then of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.010" end="00:18:22.220" style="s2">course relates to someone&#39;s capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:25.910" style="s2">we space right but then it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.220" end="00:18:27.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a capacity to perceive right</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.910" end="00:18:31.700" style="s2">because what is how do we perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.860" end="00:18:33.980" style="s2">emotional information so I said like 10</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.700" end="00:18:36.380" style="s2">I tend to think is the heart right there</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.980" end="00:18:39.020" style="s2">is like that we have like that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.380" end="00:18:41.060" style="s2">to sense and to sense if it&#39;s someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.020" end="00:18:43.130" style="s2">else when we&#39;re there in presence with</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.060" end="00:18:46.100" style="s2">them what is happening in their space or</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.130" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">intuition or instinct but then we get</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.100" end="00:18:48.740" style="s2">the inside</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:51.320" style="s2">from the verbal communication of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.740" end="00:18:55.330" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re telling us and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.320" end="00:18:59.180" style="s2">see when somebody is tight or is open or</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.330" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">and then that also creates a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.180" end="00:19:06.830" style="s2">space of trust a satanist space of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:10.360" style="s2">feeling together in in resonance I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.830" end="00:19:10.360" style="s2">say with one another</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.780" end="00:19:18.050" style="s2">you said perception I&#39;d say a way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.570" end="00:19:20.780" style="s2">we think about often is sensory input</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.050" end="00:19:22.670" style="s2">perception information processing of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.780" end="00:19:25.190" style="s2">that sensory input to make meaning out</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.190" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">choice actuator output and then being</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.350" end="00:19:49.100" style="s2">right action capacity would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.540" end="00:19:50.750" style="s2">meaningless if it couldn&#39;t be informed</p>

<p begin="00:20:05.290" end="00:20:10.160" style="s2">development and so then we think about</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.690" end="00:20:30.770" style="s2">nootropics would work on what would with</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.410" end="00:20:40.100" style="s2">like in the emotional one or would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.490" end="00:20:43.940" style="s2">because I have heard many learning right</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.100" end="00:20:46.040" style="s2">learning and a skill but I also seen</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.940" end="00:20:49.100" style="s2">videos of people that are doing artistry</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.040" end="00:20:51.710" style="s2">or not doing arts and are using it for</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.100" end="00:20:55.040" style="s2">more flow so it&#39;s right-brain left-brain</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.710" end="00:20:58.010" style="s2">aid so could you talk a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.040" end="00:21:00.620" style="s2">about that I think the word know tropics</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.010" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">is may be too narrow here right</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.620" end="00:21:07.160" style="s2">that that word is usually to denote</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:08.690" style="s2">cognitive function specifically but as</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.160" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.690" end="00:21:13.420" style="s2">emotional are not that separate and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.610" style="s2">athletic capacities that relate to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.420" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">sensing and motor capacity faster the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.610" end="00:21:20.090" style="s2">acetylcholine that increases motor</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:22.370" style="s2">capacity is the same a seagull calling</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.090" end="00:21:25.700" style="s2">that&#39;s focused on memory consolidation</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.370" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">and so the idea that those different</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.700" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">lines of development are totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:31.040" style="s2">different independent separately</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">developable pathways inside our</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.040" end="00:21:35.000" style="s2">physiology is just not how it works</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:38.750" style="s2">right it&#39;s much more integrated system</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.000" end="00:21:40.010" style="s2">than that and so affecting any of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.750" end="00:21:42.170" style="s2">things you&#39;re gonna have some effect on</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.010" end="00:21:45.080" style="s2">all of them and that&#39;s why we really</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.170" end="00:21:46.010" style="s2">think about how do we increase it but in</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.080" end="00:21:47.960" style="s2">one way you can call them all</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:49.250" style="s2">information processing different types</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.960" end="00:21:51.170" style="s2">of information being processed in</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.250" end="00:21:53.740" style="s2">different ways right and so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.170" end="00:21:56.059" style="s2">increase the effective information</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.740" end="00:21:58.600" style="s2">processing capacity of the entire system</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.059" end="00:22:01.460" style="s2">across all the lines of development</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.600" end="00:22:04.250" style="s2">thank you that made me think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.460" end="00:22:07.429" style="s2">information processing in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.250" end="00:22:10.540" style="s2">level and I know that part of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.429" end="00:22:14.450" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this work is larger than</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.540" end="00:22:16.790" style="s2">just medicine isn&#39;t why I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.450" end="00:22:19.460" style="s2">track what was your intent what is your</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.790" end="00:22:21.559" style="s2">true intent what lies behind this</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.460" end="00:22:24.140" style="s2">innovation what do you truly want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.559" end="00:22:28.730" style="s2">create in the world by launching this</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.140" end="00:22:30.650" style="s2">initiative its product the reason I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.730" end="00:22:35.090" style="s2">this product is one of lots of products</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.650" end="00:22:37.160" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got in development both for</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.090" end="00:22:39.950" style="s2">medical applications and wellness</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.160" end="00:22:41.510" style="s2">enhancement applications and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.950" end="00:22:44.440" style="s2">just scratching the surface of what kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.510" end="00:22:47.210" style="s2">of the future of human wellbeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.440" end="00:22:51.370" style="s2">optimization looks like but why that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.210" end="00:22:56.170" style="s2">whole field is interesting I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.370" end="00:23:01.550" style="s2">unnecessary suffering sucks right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.170" end="00:23:05.450" style="s2">our system of medicine and our system of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.550" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">well-being science is good at a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.450" end="00:23:09.080" style="s2">things and we&#39;ve kind of tapped those</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:11.720" style="s2">things out it&#39;s really good when the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.080" end="00:23:13.890" style="s2">causation is really obvious and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.720" end="00:23:16.230" style="s2">usually means acute causation</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.890" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">and if the causation is not really</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.230" end="00:23:22.049" style="s2">obvious because it&#39;s either delayed in</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:26.190" style="s2">time or it&#39;s multifactorial or it has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.049" end="00:23:27.750" style="s2">complex causal cascade then we call it</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.190" end="00:23:30.210" style="s2">not immune disease and neurodegenerative</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.750" end="00:23:31.470" style="s2">disease aging cancer and just really</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.210" end="00:23:33.630" style="s2">they&#39;re all idiopathic we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.470" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">know so we just do symptomatic treatment</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.630" end="00:23:41.280" style="s2">the underlying fiscal structure of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:44.400" style="s2">medicine is misaligned but doing good</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.280" end="00:23:46.650" style="s2">medicine because if we&#39;re as a business</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.400" end="00:23:48.270" style="s2">if we want to optimize the lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.650" end="00:23:52.500" style="s2">value of a customer and a customer is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.270" end="00:23:54.360" style="s2">patient then we&#39;re not really looking at</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.500" end="00:23:56.190" style="s2">preventing illness and we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.360" end="00:23:57.750" style="s2">looking at curing it quickly because if</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.190" end="00:23:59.460" style="s2">I got to do a billion dollars to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.750" end="00:24:01.020" style="s2">through phase three clinical trials and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.460" end="00:24:02.490" style="s2">then we cure someone very quickly how</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.020" end="00:24:04.710" style="s2">can we ever make the money back right</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.490" end="00:24:06.380" style="s2">we&#39;re not interested these is that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.710" end="00:24:08.730" style="s2">affect that many people in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.380" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">symptom treatment is great all right</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.730" end="00:24:11.610" style="s2">symptom treatment that causes side</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:13.380" style="s2">effects that you need another drug</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.610" end="00:24:14.910" style="s2">that&#39;s a cross seller and upsell like</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.380" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">from a business point of view that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.910" end="00:24:18.929" style="s2">great so the financial structure is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:20.700" style="s2">basically broken the IP structure where</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.929" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">we can only look at synthetic molecules</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.700" end="00:24:23.850" style="s2">that are patentable and then only during</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:25.260" style="s2">their patent life and then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.850" end="00:24:26.429" style="s2">pretend like we&#39;re innovating new better</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.260" end="00:24:28.350" style="s2">stuff just because they ran out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.429" end="00:24:31.830" style="s2">patent life like the IP structure is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.350" end="00:24:33.150" style="s2">broken and the epistemology which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.830" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to do complicated</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.150" end="00:24:38.340" style="s2">system science on complex systems right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.299" end="00:24:41.010" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to pretend that you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.340" end="00:24:43.530" style="s2">adjust one or two variables in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.010" end="00:24:47.610" style="s2">radically complex system and understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.530" end="00:24:49.410" style="s2">what its gonna do like causation doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.610" end="00:24:50.220" style="s2">make sense that way in a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.410" end="00:24:51.780" style="s2">we have to think of it more</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.220" end="00:24:54.809" style="s2">dispositional II and with much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.780" end="00:24:56.730" style="s2">complex dynamics of inner causation so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.809" end="00:24:58.860" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in just a completely</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.730" end="00:25:00.419" style="s2">new version of medicine and not even I</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.860" end="00:25:02.100" style="s2">mean obsoleting medicine of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.419" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">science and optimization at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.100" end="00:25:06.809" style="s2">physiology level but then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:08.910" style="s2">that&#39;s just the upper right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.809" end="00:25:10.410" style="s2">obviously affected by the environments</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.910" end="00:25:12.150" style="s2">that people are in and lower right by</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.410" end="00:25:16.260" style="s2">their psyche in the upper left right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.150" end="00:25:17.669" style="s2">then this now we get into how does the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.260" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">individual affect the collective and how</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.669" end="00:25:20.370" style="s2">are they affected by the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:22.710" style="s2">how do we work on those things together</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.370" end="00:25:24.990" style="s2">so if we make better if we make an</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.710" end="00:25:26.460" style="s2">environment that has less toxicity in it</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.990" end="00:25:26.910" style="s2">then we&#39;re not dealing with diseases</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.460" end="00:25:31.170" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.910" end="00:25:33.390" style="s2">toxicological origin right the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.170" end="00:25:35.910" style="s2">individual the better systems of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.390" end="00:25:40.230" style="s2">agriculture better systems of education</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.910" end="00:25:42.690" style="s2">media but the better economic system</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.230" end="00:25:44.460" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t create stress economic</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.690" end="00:25:46.530" style="s2">systems governance system sense making</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.460" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">systems now how can we affect</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.530" end="00:25:50.160" style="s2">individuals today so that they influence</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:53.280" style="s2">the collective in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.160" end="00:25:56.070" style="s2">both directions are true right the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.280" end="00:25:57.540" style="s2">Republican Democrat historic debates the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.070" end="00:25:59.070" style="s2">libertarian Marxist debates have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.540" end="00:26:01.580" style="s2">around which of those directions were</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.070" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">more important and they are reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.580" end="00:26:10.050" style="s2">and so why we were real interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:11.880" style="s2">the kind of individual optimization side</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.050" end="00:26:14.790" style="s2">is obviously human quality of life is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.880" end="00:26:16.140" style="s2">intrinsically meaningful period and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.790" end="00:26:19.020" style="s2">just intrinsically meaningful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.140" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">actually meaning reifies in subjective</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.020" end="00:26:26.130" style="s2">experience and the next step is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:28.050" style="s2">we&#39;re not just interested in humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.130" end="00:26:30.030" style="s2">having increased quality of life but</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.050" end="00:26:31.710" style="s2">also increase capacity to act</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.030" end="00:26:34.110" style="s2">meaningfully in ways that affect the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.710" end="00:26:37.410" style="s2">quality of life of everyone else right</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.110" end="00:26:40.410" style="s2">not just human but all all things and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.410" end="00:26:42.840" style="s2">it happens to be that what really</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.410" end="00:26:44.430" style="s2">increases human capacity and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.840" end="00:26:47.310" style="s2">increases their quality of life is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.430" end="00:26:53.190" style="s2">same thing this is again optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.310" end="00:26:57.870" style="s2">across a dialectic and so when we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.190" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">looking at existential crisis right</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.870" end="00:27:02.370" style="s2">existential threats who are looking at</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.170" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">economic dynamics when we&#39;re looking at</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.380" end="00:29:17.240" style="s2">influenced by physiology and what we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.660" end="00:29:19.370" style="s2">do with both better agriculture systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.240" end="00:29:22.010" style="s2">and better medicine systems better</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.370" end="00:29:24.290" style="s2">activity systems I mean everything the</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.270" end="00:29:41.480" style="s2">people who are interested and radically</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.040" end="00:29:44.090" style="s2">increase their quality of life and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.480" end="00:29:45.530" style="s2">capacity so then they can start to</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.530" end="00:29:49.900" style="s2">happen more and we can get virtuous</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.650" end="00:29:59.040" style="s2">okay that&#39;s that&#39;s an entry point to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.100" end="00:30:05.540" style="s2">integral civilizations design work that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.040" end="00:30:10.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve been doing and so what is in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.540" end="00:30:12.780" style="s2">perspective the things that people in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.740" end="00:30:17.940" style="s2">their ordinary people are listening to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.780" end="00:30:21.540" style="s2">us need to be looking into like these</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.940" end="00:30:25.830" style="s2">steps that people can be more aware in</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.540" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">their lives so that we move together</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.830" end="00:30:34.170" style="s2">into a pattern of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:35.850" style="s2">hmm well it&#39;s a tricky question because</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.170" end="00:30:38.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t know who&#39;s listening and what</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.850" end="00:30:41.820" style="s2">capacities they have and what interests</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.970" end="00:30:44.550" style="s2">and availabilities and etc so I would I</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.820" end="00:30:47.940" style="s2">would generally talk about that and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.550" end="00:30:55.170" style="s2">more personalized and hopefully relevant</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.940" end="00:30:57.810" style="s2">way most of the times we think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.170" end="00:31:00.500" style="s2">actions we can all do in our own life to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.810" end="00:31:03.660" style="s2">make things better at a global level we</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.500" end="00:31:05.700" style="s2">think about pretty trivial and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.660" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2">mean to say these things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.700" end="00:31:10.020" style="s2">important but trivial relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:11.940" style="s2">scope and urgency of the issues and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.020" end="00:31:18.800" style="s2">complexity we think about basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.940" end="00:31:21.090" style="s2">consuming less stuff and organic</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.800" end="00:31:23.970" style="s2">consuming better stuff or less stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.090" end="00:31:26.940" style="s2">right now which our focus is being less</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.970" end="00:31:29.550" style="s2">bad where we are net negative we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.940" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">basically liabilities on nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.550" end="00:31:33.150" style="s2">balance sheet right rather than assets</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.740" end="00:31:36.030" style="s2">on nature&#39;s balance sheet if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.150" end="00:31:37.710" style="s2">look at the code amount of biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.030" end="00:31:38.970" style="s2">or the health and complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.710" end="00:31:41.490" style="s2">biosphere as a whole and we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.970" end="00:31:42.840" style="s2">at can we slow how bad we are like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.490" end="00:31:45.780" style="s2">just a totally wrong way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.840" end="00:31:47.160" style="s2">about it I mean it&#39;s a fine starting</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.780" end="00:31:49.440" style="s2">point to think about but really we</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.160" end="00:31:51.330" style="s2">actually have to build a new human</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:53.030" style="s2">civilization that is fundamentally on</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.330" end="00:31:55.560" style="s2">the asset side of nature&#39;s balance sheet</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.030" end="00:31:58.140" style="s2">that is net positive to everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.560" end="00:31:59.850" style="s2">that&#39;s meaningful and that doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.140" end="00:32:01.630" style="s2">like a retrofit of this civilization at</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.850" end="00:32:06.310" style="s2">all it looks like fundamental ground</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.630" end="00:32:07.990" style="s2">redesign work I mean there now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.310" end="00:32:10.650" style="s2">know how deep will go and how familiar</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.990" end="00:32:14.860" style="s2">people are but there-there is no system</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.650" end="00:32:17.260" style="s2">there&#39;s no version of capitalism it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.860" end="00:32:19.030" style="s2">adequate as a system of macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.260" end="00:32:21.100" style="s2">in the presence of exponential</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.030" end="00:32:24.070" style="s2">technology and in the presence of answer</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.070" end="00:32:29.380" style="s2">biosphere at this point and etc that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.260" end="00:32:32.910" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lead to catastrophic giving</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.380" end="00:32:35.040" style="s2">phones there&#39;s no version of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.910" end="00:32:37.450" style="s2">representative democracy within</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.040" end="00:32:39.520" style="s2">nationalist governments that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.450" end="00:32:42.550" style="s2">lead to catastrophic problems so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.520" end="00:32:46.690" style="s2">kind of shift that we need is axiom</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.550" end="00:32:47.980" style="s2">level and I&#39;m not gonna propose Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.690" end="00:32:49.510" style="s2">or socialism or any other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.980" end="00:32:52.390" style="s2">hasn&#39;t worked I&#39;m gonna propose things</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.510" end="00:32:54.910" style="s2">that are reverse engineered from design</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.390" end="00:32:56.800" style="s2">constraints of what&#39;s actually necessary</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.910" end="00:32:58.150" style="s2">and sufficient they&#39;re fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.800" end="00:32:59.500" style="s2">different than any kinds of systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.150" end="00:33:02.530" style="s2">proposed so far but have learned from</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.500" end="00:33:09.130" style="s2">them and learn a lot from how nature and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.530" end="00:33:11.290" style="s2">complement systems work so yeah if I if</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.130" end="00:33:12.910" style="s2">I was to be saying in general what can</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.290" end="00:33:14.710" style="s2">people do to be helpful to that I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.910" end="00:33:19.150" style="s2">say be aware that civilization as we</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.710" end="00:33:23.560" style="s2">know it is self terminating stop trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.150" end="00:33:28.660" style="s2">to win at a self terminating game going</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.560" end="00:33:30.760" style="s2">I know what start really earnestly</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.660" end="00:33:32.500" style="s2">exploring what alternatives that might</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.760" end="00:33:33.810" style="s2">be viable look like and how you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.500" end="00:33:38.590" style="s2">contribute your life energy to them</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.810" end="00:33:41.500" style="s2">mm-hmm so yeah let me do that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.590" end="00:33:44.560" style="s2">agree with you in in regards to how</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.500" end="00:33:46.750" style="s2">we&#39;re facing in these collapse in all</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.560" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">levels and the complexity is way too</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.750" end="00:33:52.950" style="s2">fast for anyone to really know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:57.430" style="s2">how so the amount of number of paths</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.950" end="00:33:58.530" style="s2">possible it&#39;s overwhelming it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.430" end="00:34:02.470" style="s2">really overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.530" end="00:34:04.540" style="s2">so yeah why have you found in your</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.470" end="00:34:06.280" style="s2">research that gives a hope for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.540" end="00:34:08.379" style="s2">future what is that you found in your</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.280" end="00:34:10.870" style="s2">research that it would say have you find</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.379" end="00:34:13.090" style="s2">these places where you say we would find</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.870" end="00:34:16.070" style="s2">these then</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.090" end="00:34:18.649" style="s2">we could reverse into an infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.070" end="00:34:25.429" style="s2">we can actually do this can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.649" end="00:34:27.110" style="s2">do this yeah you know speaking to an</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.429" end="00:34:29.179" style="s2">inner audience there are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.110" end="00:34:32.330" style="s2">very helpful in each quadrant and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.179" end="00:34:41.060" style="s2">across all the quadrants that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.330" end="00:34:43.370" style="s2">already plausible and lower right we</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.060" end="00:34:46.760" style="s2">need to stop building complicated</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.370" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">technology complicated built worlds and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.760" end="00:34:54.440" style="s2">start actually building emergent complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">worlds that are extensions of the design</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.440" end="00:34:58.150" style="s2">principles and complexity of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:00.740" style="s2">world and that are commensurate with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.150" end="00:35:02.450" style="s2">and this means that you stop building</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.740" end="00:35:05.770" style="s2">individual pieces of tech and you build</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.450" end="00:35:08.900" style="s2">whole tech ecosystems right that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.770" end="00:35:11.720" style="s2">regenerative closed-loop post growth</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.900" end="00:35:14.300" style="s2">upcycling techy ecosystems and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.720" end="00:35:15.770" style="s2">means entire materials economies where</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.300" end="00:35:19.160" style="s2">you have a closed-loop on the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.770" end="00:35:23.060" style="s2">right the atoms are actually you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.160" end="00:35:25.130" style="s2">needing new atom acquisition from mining</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.060" end="00:35:26.540" style="s2">or virgin resource acquisition and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.130" end="00:35:28.910" style="s2">you&#39;re not turning any of the atoms into</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.540" end="00:35:30.950" style="s2">wastes your fundamental circle our</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.910" end="00:35:33.530" style="s2">economy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.950" end="00:35:35.600" style="s2">circular closed-loop economy and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.530" end="00:35:39.500" style="s2">where the same stuff gets to keep being</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.600" end="00:35:42.140" style="s2">better in better forms within a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.500" end="00:35:44.390" style="s2">number of atoms a post growth system so</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.140" end="00:35:45.620" style="s2">basically steady-state system with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.390" end="00:35:48.110" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at steady-state</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.620" end="00:35:49.700" style="s2">populations that are aligned with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.110" end="00:35:52.040" style="s2">carrying capacity of the planet and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.700" end="00:35:54.740" style="s2">they&#39;re up cycling because pattern</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.040" end="00:35:57.110" style="s2">information continues to evolve and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.740" end="00:36:00.860" style="s2">continue to impound new photons so we</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.110" end="00:36:03.770" style="s2">have to think of atoms photons energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.860" end="00:36:05.810" style="s2">and pattern as three totally different</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.770" end="00:36:07.580" style="s2">non fungible things in the future of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.810" end="00:36:09.380" style="s2">economics we&#39;re going to be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.580" end="00:36:11.480" style="s2">a finite number of atoms we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.380" end="00:36:14.030" style="s2">dealing with a much larger and less</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.480" end="00:36:19.070" style="s2">bounded amount of energy and an almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.030" end="00:36:21.560" style="s2">unbounded amount of information and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.070" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">those are those are non fungible with</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.560" end="00:36:24.440" style="s2">each other so you can&#39;t relate them all</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">to a currency and trade them it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.440" end="00:36:29.950" style="s2">make any sense because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:31.630" style="s2">tradeable so so building the right kinds</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:34.840" style="s2">of infrastructure that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.630" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">resilient complex closed-loop up cycling</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.840" end="00:36:40.900" style="s2">infrastructure that&#39;s a very hopeful and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:43.450" style="s2">exciting thing is possible right in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.900" end="00:36:46.210" style="s2">lower-left we can think about building</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.450" end="00:36:48.070" style="s2">new systems of sense-making intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.210" end="00:36:52.900" style="s2">right new systems of governance choice</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.070" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">making new systems of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.900" end="00:36:58.540" style="s2">collective meaning making you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:37:00.609" style="s2">culture I talked about economics</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.540" end="00:37:04.650" style="s2">actually new systems of basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.609" end="00:37:06.609" style="s2">resource allocation and human</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.650" end="00:37:08.050" style="s2">influencing patterns of human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.609" end="00:37:11.619" style="s2">which are the two things that economics</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.050" end="00:37:14.050" style="s2">really deeply does as we are moving to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.619" end="00:37:15.090" style="s2">world where most of the shitty jobs can</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.050" end="00:37:17.740" style="s2">be automated</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.090" end="00:37:19.630" style="s2">one of the major axioms of why</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.740" end="00:37:22.630" style="s2">capitalism mattered was how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.630" end="00:37:26.020" style="s2">people to be the shitty jobs they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.630" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">like it&#39;s fun to lay roads for a day for</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.020" end="00:37:29.260" style="s2">a couple days and learn how to do it but</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.060" style="s2">nobody wants to spend their whole you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.260" end="00:37:32.830" style="s2">know multiple decades doing that 40 plus</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.060" end="00:37:36.820" style="s2">hours a week but society needs it done</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.830" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">and so if the jobs need the people to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.820" end="00:37:41.290" style="s2">get done then we got to make it to where</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:42.670" style="s2">the people need the jobs otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.290" end="00:37:44.200" style="s2">know if you do a Marxist thing we spread</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.670" end="00:37:45.790" style="s2">the resources between everybody then</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.200" end="00:37:47.170" style="s2">nobody wants to do the shitty jobs in</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.790" end="00:37:49.030" style="s2">the state has to force when we call it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.170" end="00:37:51.250" style="s2">imperialism and so we don&#39;t like Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.030" end="00:37:52.599" style="s2">so we like it when the market which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.250" end="00:37:57.400" style="s2">if you don&#39;t do the shitty jobs you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.599" end="00:37:59.290" style="s2">starve right but that&#39;s free and then we</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.400" end="00:38:00.940" style="s2">say but you can educate yourself and get</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.290" end="00:38:02.710" style="s2">a better job but that&#39;s statistically I</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.940" end="00:38:04.900" style="s2">mean it&#39;s theoretically possible but</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.710" end="00:38:06.940" style="s2">statistically very hard when those who</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.900" end="00:38:08.830" style="s2">are born into more have more resources</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.940" end="00:38:10.420" style="s2">to create more resources with those were</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.830" end="00:38:15.880" style="s2">born into less have less she get these</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.420" end="00:38:18.550" style="s2">ever widening gaps etc so but when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.880" end="00:38:20.260" style="s2">can start to automate and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.550" end="00:38:22.089" style="s2">looking at automation of most of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.260" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">jobs over the next not not too many</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.089" end="00:38:27.550" style="s2">years I&#39;m not only you know all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:29.980" style="s2">jobs not only the automated very shitty</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.550" end="00:38:32.020" style="s2">jobs were also high level right like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.980" end="00:38:33.740" style="s2">diagnosis medical anything that you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.020" end="00:38:37.130" style="s2">write a procedure for</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.740" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">you can if you can write a procedure for</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.130" end="00:38:41.000" style="s2">it you can make a machine to a better</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:43.100" style="s2">than us if you can write a procedure for</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.000" end="00:38:44.600" style="s2">it it&#39;s not that fun for creative beings</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.100" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">to spend must at much of their life</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.600" end="00:38:48.860" style="s2">doing yeah and so you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">extrinsic Lee and sent them to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.860" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">because infants are consented wants to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:56.300" style="s2">do things that are either connection or</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:59.090" style="s2">creativity based yes and so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.300" end="00:39:00.770" style="s2">is either we try and stick with</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.090" end="00:39:02.750" style="s2">capitalism and have the most grotesque</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.770" end="00:39:06.110" style="s2">inequality come with technological</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.750" end="00:39:07.820" style="s2">unemployment or we say well wait the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.110" end="00:39:09.530" style="s2">whole reason major part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.820" end="00:39:11.060" style="s2">reason to the capitalism I&#39;m using one</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.530" end="00:39:12.940" style="s2">axiom there&#39;s obviously twenty others</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.060" end="00:39:16.250" style="s2">but we can go through all of them is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.940" end="00:39:17.660" style="s2">well now that we the people that jobs</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.250" end="00:39:19.550" style="s2">don&#39;t need the people anymore we can</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:26.270" style="s2">we move from an economics of extrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.970" end="00:39:27.470" style="s2">motive to a system of intrinsic motives</p>

<p begin="00:40:56.210" end="00:41:00.980" style="s2">get into it but we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.319" end="00:41:02.390" style="s2">architectures for how to do that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.980" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">giving a few examples but I want to let</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.750" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">want to go a little deeper in the realm</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.720" end="00:42:04.849" style="s2">those higher weeks right why does it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.150" end="00:42:06.980" style="s2">matter for people to right now get</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.849" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">together and get a better sense of each</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.980" end="00:42:12.529" style="s2">other and connect on not only mentally</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:16.009" style="s2">and cognitively but also in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.529" end="00:42:17.900" style="s2">resonance and and an energy because yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.009" end="00:42:21.319" style="s2">we want to be sign according to living</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.900" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">systems and according to nature and and</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.910" end="00:42:51.890" style="s2">do now and what is to get activated</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.670" end="00:44:37.970" style="s2">great ok so we can see the world in a</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.970" end="00:44:44.100" style="s2">currently in many parts of the world</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.100" end="00:44:52.860" style="s2">and the the political philosophy around</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.120" end="00:44:55.350" style="s2">this has been kind of the Machiavellian</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.860" end="00:44:56.820" style="s2">enemy hypothesis which is the only way</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.350" end="00:44:58.470" style="s2">to get people of very different</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.820" end="00:44:59.880" style="s2">dispositions together as if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.470" end="00:45:02.490" style="s2">larger enemy where they have to band</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.880" end="00:45:03.930" style="s2">together otherwise they&#39;ll keep going</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.490" end="00:45:08.820" style="s2">tribal until they get down to the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.930" end="00:45:14.570" style="s2">number and that has been mostly true</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.820" end="00:45:14.570" style="s2">right and so when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.670" end="00:45:21.480" style="s2">kind of very bizarre version of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.450" end="00:45:23.970" style="s2">postmodernism control left that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.480" end="00:45:25.380" style="s2">really driving the cohesion of a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.970" end="00:45:27.749" style="s2">of different groups into what&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.380" end="00:45:29.700" style="s2">called the alt-right and the white</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.749" end="00:45:31.890" style="s2">nationalist and etc movements with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.700" end="00:45:35.819" style="s2">and you look at how far apart those are</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.890" end="00:45:39.539" style="s2">from each other how the do you</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.819" end="00:45:41.279" style="s2">bring that together right and how the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.539" end="00:45:43.289" style="s2"> does that not become civil war and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.279" end="00:45:47.579" style="s2">how does civil war in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.289" end="00:45:49.289" style="s2">not become world war well if the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.579" end="00:45:50.970" style="s2">way to bring it together is to have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.289" end="00:45:53.190" style="s2">external enemy we&#39;ve been in more for</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.970" end="00:45:55.380" style="s2">decades now right if is to have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.190" end="00:45:57.450" style="s2">external enemy big enough that the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.380" end="00:45:58.859" style="s2">and left our friends in relationships a</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.450" end="00:46:03.059" style="s2">external enemy that&#39;s also a world war</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.859" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">yes all right so these strategies just</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.059" end="00:46:11.519" style="s2">don&#39;t look good at all and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:13.980" style="s2">things is that the first even people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.519" end="00:46:16.470" style="s2">understand military strategy military</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.980" end="00:46:19.049" style="s2">history I think underestimates both</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.470" end="00:46:21.390" style="s2">anthro complexity the complexity and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.049" end="00:46:24.180" style="s2">unpredictability of 7 billion people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.390" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">how many non-state actors have so much</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.180" end="00:46:29.190" style="s2">power and etc and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:31.319" style="s2">underestimate what exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.190" end="00:46:33.509" style="s2">really means in terms of making that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.319" end="00:46:36.749" style="s2">anything applicable in the past is it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.509" end="00:46:41.099" style="s2">like well now so to kind of get into</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.749" end="00:46:42.779" style="s2">that you know we saw a couple weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.099" end="00:46:46.289" style="s2">now I don&#39;t know when this airs maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.779" end="00:46:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;ll be months ago a drone drop a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.289" end="00:46:54.749" style="s2">thermite bomb in the in the Ukraine on a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.450" end="00:46:56.759" style="s2">munitions factory and it created a you</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.749" end="00:47:00.680" style="s2">know a multibillion-dollar level of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.759" end="00:47:05.160" style="s2">damage from one little drone you know a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.680" end="00:47:06.749" style="s2">near nuclear level of damage and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.160" end="00:47:09.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know who did it but it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.749" end="00:47:11.339" style="s2">do and that was not even a swarm of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.450" end="00:47:13.529" style="s2">drones in building a swarm of drones</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.339" end="00:47:15.690" style="s2">with AI swarming algorithms from github</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.529" end="00:47:18.269" style="s2">that you can build in your own garage</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.690" end="00:47:21.299" style="s2">and web like we have exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.269" end="00:47:22.710" style="s2">capability where non-state actors were</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.299" end="00:47:24.920" style="s2">little bitty actors that we can&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:36.109" style="s2">that&#39;s a big and it&#39;s in Greece</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.619" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">Christmas cards just became $1,000 a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.109" end="00:47:42.619" style="s2">year ago right and think about what that</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:46.599" style="s2">means think about what the increasing AI</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.619" end="00:47:50.539" style="s2">and nanotech capacities mean right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.599" end="00:47:52.069" style="s2">so the first existential technology we</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.539" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">had detect where we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.069" end="00:47:58.730" style="s2">everything that was the bomb but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:48:00.529" style="s2">bomb was such a expensive difficult</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.730" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">thing to build the US was the only one</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.529" end="00:48:03.740" style="s2">who had and then US and Russia two</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.740" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">to assure destruction with their Intel</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.210" end="00:48:20.390" style="s2">method safety yeah but as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.660" end="00:48:22.130" style="s2">have so many nuclear powers and you have</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.609" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">right how the did how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:36.200" style="s2">through that so one you know when we</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.200" end="00:48:43.430" style="s2">on one of the things we define is a</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.430" end="00:48:51.319" style="s2">fragile in the presence of extra Kalidas</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:52.940" style="s2">tributed exponential tech right how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.319" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">how do we have resilience and anti</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.940" end="00:48:58.490" style="s2">fragility in the presence of that well</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:49:02.000" style="s2">most answers to that go Orwellian in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.490" end="00:49:03.170" style="s2">hurry Vic we deceive ourselves and know</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:04.660" style="s2">who&#39;s doing what and be able to shut it</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.170" end="00:49:08.119" style="s2">down because we can&#39;t let it happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.660" end="00:49:10.069" style="s2">right well that&#39;s already a film state</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.119" end="00:49:12.410" style="s2">because that level of disco hearin</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.069" end="00:49:14.089" style="s2">stress perspective leads to failed</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.410" end="00:49:17.930" style="s2">failed state for other reasons in</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.089" end="00:49:20.930" style="s2">dystopian so the only answer we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.930" end="00:49:25.099" style="s2">make it through our power curve involves</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.930" end="00:49:27.019" style="s2">we space involved a radical upregulation</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.099" end="00:49:29.029" style="s2">of people knowing each other knowing</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.019" end="00:49:31.130" style="s2">when someone is off no one being that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.029" end="00:49:32.900" style="s2">off because they feel so isolated and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.130" end="00:49:36.670" style="s2">disenfranchised and existential angst</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.900" end="00:49:38.930" style="s2">&#39;full hmm right and that being</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.670" end="00:49:41.329" style="s2">structurally built in a way where it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.930" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">ubiquitous we actually have no way</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:48.019" style="s2">that at the center now let me say it</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.579" end="00:49:49.309" style="s2">another way because I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.019" end="00:49:51.769" style="s2">valuable to think of it this way you</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.309" end="00:49:55.130" style="s2">mentioned moving from finite to infinite</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.769" end="00:49:57.319" style="s2">games and if there&#39;s anyone who hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.130" end="00:50:00.619" style="s2">read that book it&#39;s a classic finding</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.319" end="00:50:02.630" style="s2">infinite games to come into I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.619" end="00:50:06.799" style="s2">speak to it in a even more popular and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.630" end="00:50:11.959" style="s2">simple way which is all finite games are</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.799" end="00:50:15.589" style="s2">win-lose games we&#39;re actually coming to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.959" end="00:50:17.809" style="s2">an end of when lose game theory at a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.589" end="00:50:20.229" style="s2">social level and this is actually a key</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.809" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">way of thinking about we space on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.229" end="00:50:24.709" style="s2">sports team we create a sense of we with</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.469" style="s2">our team and we&#39;ll have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.709" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">coherence with each other to be to beat</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.469" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">the other ones and we have a bay with</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:33.589" style="s2">them right so we get to do in-group</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">out-group mentality now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.589" end="00:50:37.369" style="s2">training - for kids to be good at that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:41.390" style="s2">psychology for when it&#39;s time for war</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.369" end="00:50:45.319" style="s2">and you know whatever else frame go back</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.390" end="00:50:47.809" style="s2">to tribes event the time of tribes would</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.319" end="00:50:49.549" style="s2">create coherence with each other to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.809" end="00:50:51.739" style="s2">able to be competitive with another</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.549" end="00:50:53.509" style="s2">tribe if need be now if there&#39;s low</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.739" end="00:50:55.729" style="s2">population relative to lots of resources</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.509" end="00:50:57.469" style="s2">we&#39;re all cool with each other if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.729" end="00:50:58.849" style="s2">population gets high relative to not</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.469" end="00:51:00.170" style="s2">that many resources we start raising</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.849" end="00:51:03.499" style="s2">that kill and the other people is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.170" end="00:51:05.150" style="s2">viable strategy and trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.499" end="00:51:07.759" style="s2">compete them for the scarce resources</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.150" end="00:51:09.380" style="s2">also and then strategy so those are two</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.759" end="00:51:10.969" style="s2">methods of competing now compete them</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.380" end="00:51:14.239" style="s2">for scarce resources and directly</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.969" end="00:51:17.029" style="s2">militarily attacks now throughout all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.239" end="00:51:18.890" style="s2">history two things have been true one</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.029" end="00:51:21.499" style="s2">this strategy worked</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.890" end="00:51:22.910" style="s2">you actually could kill the other people</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.499" end="00:51:26.029" style="s2">get the river front and life is better</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.910" end="00:51:28.309" style="s2">for you and your people and two if</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.029" end="00:51:30.309" style="s2">anyone else played win-lose games you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.309" end="00:51:32.630" style="s2">had two or lose by default</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.309" end="00:51:34.339" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t create a military and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.630" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">anyone else has realized this killing</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.339" end="00:51:39.019" style="s2">other people thing works didn&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">die by default and so militaristic</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.019" end="00:51:46.609" style="s2">win-lose games have been necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">then a couple tribes joined together to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.609" end="00:51:49.160" style="s2">be able to fight the bigger tribe they</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:50.839" style="s2">couldn&#39;t fight and so then you get more</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.160" end="00:51:53.180" style="s2">tribes banding together so now we get</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.839" end="00:51:54.890" style="s2">villages and kingdoms and nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.180" end="00:51:58.099" style="s2">and global economic trading bloc&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.890" end="00:52:00.650" style="s2">and the tools of commerce increase we</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.099" end="00:52:03.170" style="s2">get fiat currencies fractional reserve</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.650" end="00:52:04.880" style="s2">banking etc to increase our power our</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.170" end="00:52:06.319" style="s2">tools of extraction of resource from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.880" end="00:52:08.779" style="s2">environment and our military tools</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.319" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">increase this is just upping the ante on</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.779" end="00:52:13.789" style="s2">win-lose games right until we have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:15.170" style="s2">biggest players we can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.789" end="00:52:17.240" style="s2">have with the biggest tech we can have</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.170" end="00:52:18.799" style="s2">in both our ability to compete for</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.240" end="00:52:19.670" style="s2">scarce resource and to direct attack</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.799" end="00:52:23.299" style="s2">each other when needed</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.670" end="00:52:25.099" style="s2">but you get to a place about now where</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.299" end="00:52:28.789" style="s2">you have so much power that you can no</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.099" end="00:52:30.380" style="s2">longer win that winning requires</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.789" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">destroying the playing field equals</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.380" end="00:52:36.109" style="s2">losing and if we try to out-compete each</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:37.940" style="s2">other for the scarce resource we just</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.109" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">ruin the biospheres capacity to support</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.940" end="00:52:42.589" style="s2">us and we get then massive migrations of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.660" style="s2">humans causing Wars and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.589" end="00:52:46.220" style="s2">and if we try and actually beat each</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.660" end="00:52:47.480" style="s2">other with our military technologies</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.220" end="00:52:49.670" style="s2">everybody does because we have way too</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.480" end="00:52:51.829" style="s2">much military technology that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.670" end="00:52:53.299" style="s2">been true before war always worked out</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.829" end="00:52:56.869" style="s2">competing them for resource always</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.299" end="00:52:58.789" style="s2">worked it will never work again and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.869" end="00:53:00.500" style="s2">we&#39;re at a place where win lose game</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.789" end="00:53:02.509" style="s2">theory which equals strategy the word</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.500" end="00:53:04.009" style="s2">strategy means win lose game theory how</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.509" end="00:53:06.589" style="s2">to be effective in the menues game</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.009" end="00:53:08.150" style="s2">that&#39;s like all military strategy man</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.589" end="00:53:12.349" style="s2">business strategy derived from military</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.150" end="00:53:14.569" style="s2">strategy that&#39;s gone because that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.349" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">becomes Omni lose-lose so either we</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.569" end="00:53:18.950" style="s2">figure out Omni win-win which means how</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.329" style="s2">do we meet needs while meeting the needs</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.950" end="00:53:21.890" style="s2">of everyone else involved and the</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.279" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">what does that mean from a we space as</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:36.710" style="s2">it means there is no other so we</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:40.039" style="s2">actually have to get off in-group</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.710" end="00:53:42.680" style="s2">out-group mentality there is no answer</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.039" end="00:53:45.380" style="s2">to making it through our technological</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.680" end="00:53:46.819" style="s2">capacity an existential risk without</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.819" end="00:53:50.890" style="s2">mentality and having it all be in-group</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.109" end="00:54:02.040" style="s2">so by developing the capacity</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.990" end="00:54:12.280" style="s2">probably a good idea for people to be</p>

<p begin="00:54:12.280" end="00:54:19.690" style="s2">another for all the people who thought</p>

<p begin="00:55:55.310" end="00:55:59.990" style="s2">and when will you talk about your utopia</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.380" end="00:56:03.640" style="s2">said we would have utopic movies</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.990" end="00:56:03.640" style="s2">probably know where it would go right</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.570" end="00:56:10.820" style="s2">you know so but if we can hold that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.820" end="00:56:13.790" style="s2">together that we can go into that curve</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.820" end="00:56:16.970" style="s2">that we can lift each other up we can</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.970" end="00:56:35.630" style="s2">seems that is the time for us to get</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.630" end="00:56:40.340" style="s2">and enter and try to do those with</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.340" end="00:56:46.550" style="s2">necessarily similar to us this is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.490" end="00:56:49.100" style="s2">key part I want people to give it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.550" end="00:56:51.200" style="s2">easy for us to reach a point of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.100" end="00:56:53.420" style="s2">seems like fundamental disagreement and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.200" end="00:56:56.030" style="s2">then just disconnect I&#39;m not gonna hang</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.420" end="00:56:58.070" style="s2">out with this person for I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.030" end="00:57:00.230" style="s2">hang out this group of people or</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.070" end="00:57:02.780" style="s2">them let&#39;s start a war or let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.230" end="00:57:04.730" style="s2">ignore them right let&#39;s just get those</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.780" end="00:57:10.100" style="s2">people because they are effectively bad</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.730" end="00:57:11.690" style="s2">to us doesn&#39;t work anymore we actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.100" end="00:57:12.980" style="s2">can&#39;t win those wars because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.690" end="00:57:15.080" style="s2">lot of people that think that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.980" end="00:57:18.170" style="s2">that thing is and they have exponential</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.080" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">techtube and as soon as you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.170" end="00:57:22.670" style="s2">we share the planet and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:25.250" style="s2">can&#39;t get the other groups off then you</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.670" end="00:57:27.260" style="s2">say I&#39;ve got to actually figure out</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.250" end="00:57:29.840" style="s2">what is it that is meaningful to them</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.260" end="00:57:32.300" style="s2">and the day value and where can we build</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.840" end="00:57:34.700" style="s2">bridges and the whole just I</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.300" end="00:57:37.910" style="s2">I&#39;m going to not interact with them and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.700" end="00:57:41.470" style="s2"> them that just doesn&#39;t work and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.910" end="00:57:46.610" style="s2">then you start asking more questions and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.470" end="00:57:57.740" style="s2">you open up your willingness and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.610" end="00:58:00.020" style="s2">capacity for understanding understanding</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.740" end="00:58:01.820" style="s2">bridge building what so what is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.020" end="00:58:03.650" style="s2">understanding of bridge building and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.820" end="00:58:06.530" style="s2">where are transition technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.650" end="00:58:10.810" style="s2">you see already happening that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.530" end="00:58:13.700" style="s2">can start to be aware of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.810" end="00:58:15.590" style="s2">prototyping a very interesting process</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.700" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">of sense making right now that involves</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.590" end="00:58:22.100" style="s2">human sensors and I&#39;ll tell you one step</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:25.220" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.100" end="00:58:27.920" style="s2">partner partner mind forest land</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.220" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">redevelop this Partners got a really</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.920" end="00:58:33.020" style="s2">beautiful insight so group of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:35.210" style="s2">come together for governance for choice</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.020" end="00:58:36.590" style="s2">making you can&#39;t do choice making before</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.210" end="00:58:38.780" style="s2">you&#39;ve done since making because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.590" end="00:58:41.780" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the to do right you</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.780" end="00:58:44.450" style="s2">and so one of the one thing we can say</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.780" end="00:58:47.800" style="s2">is that if your governance system</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.450" end="00:58:50.630" style="s2">involves voting it&#39;s already broken</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.800" end="00:58:52.690" style="s2">because voting means that some things</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.630" end="00:58:54.860" style="s2">that are valuable are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.690" end="00:58:56.210" style="s2">benefited at the cost of other things</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.860" end="00:58:58.100" style="s2">that are valuable we&#39;re gonna see who</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.210" end="00:59:00.080" style="s2">values which ones more again in an</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.100" end="00:59:01.490" style="s2">exponential curve world that just</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.080" end="00:59:03.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work whenever things are being</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.490" end="00:59:05.420" style="s2">harmed and they&#39;re becoming catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.070" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">and you polarized the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.420" end="00:59:09.080" style="s2">associated with the different values so</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">typically when we have a choice to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.080" end="00:59:13.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like do we bow yes or no on this</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:14.330" style="s2">proposition both sides suck because it</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.010" end="00:59:17.540" style="s2">was a welfare it was a ill firm</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.330" end="00:59:18.950" style="s2">proposition right so we get the we get</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.540" end="00:59:20.210" style="s2">the economics but we destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.950" end="00:59:22.760" style="s2">environment or we keep the environment</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.210" end="00:59:24.370" style="s2">destroy the economy we actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.760" end="00:59:26.570" style="s2">do a better job of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.370" end="00:59:27.770" style="s2">everything that is meaningful regarding</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.570" end="00:59:29.420" style="s2">this decision and all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.770" end="00:59:31.280" style="s2">interconnected first and take all those</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.420" end="00:59:33.980" style="s2">as design constraints to an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.280" end="00:59:36.230" style="s2">design process and so there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.980" end="00:59:37.940" style="s2">making the proceeds a choice making and</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.230" end="00:59:42.500" style="s2">so part of how this process works is</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.940" end="00:59:44.780" style="s2">group of people come together to do the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.500" end="00:59:48.530" style="s2">sense-making regarding an issue and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.780" end="00:59:50.420" style="s2">let&#39;s say the the issue is do we build</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.530" end="00:59:53.840" style="s2">this bridge or not right or the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.420" end="00:59:56.150" style="s2">what is a adequate governance system or</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.840" end="00:59:59.150" style="s2">whatever so we start with a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.150" end="01:00:00.950" style="s2">of questions right we have a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.150" end="01:00:03.870" style="s2">of questions that are relevant to answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.950" end="01:00:06.430" style="s2">this and and so the question might be</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.870" end="01:00:08.660" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.430" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say we&#39;re asking say we were</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.660" end="01:00:12.650" style="s2">leading one on governance itself what do</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:14.510" style="s2">we think of liquid democracy what do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.650" end="01:00:16.360" style="s2">think of voting currencies what do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.510" end="01:00:18.860" style="s2">think of non voting systems would we</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.360" end="01:00:21.050" style="s2">what are the strengths and weaknesses of</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.860" end="01:00:22.130" style="s2">dynamic governance or socio cracy where</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.050" end="01:00:23.480" style="s2">you know whatever right you have a whole</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.130" end="01:00:26.330" style="s2">bunch of things what about when is</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.480" end="01:00:28.640" style="s2">meritocracy useful versus consensus so</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.330" end="01:00:31.160" style="s2">then you have all these questions and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:32.360" style="s2">then people that are interested in those</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.160" end="01:00:37.610" style="s2">questions break off into small groups</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.360" end="01:00:39.380" style="s2">and they ask a few questions related to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.610" end="01:00:40.940" style="s2">that question one question is in order</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.380" end="01:00:42.650" style="s2">to answer this question what additional</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.940" end="01:00:44.800" style="s2">questions would we have to ask and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.650" end="01:00:49.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a process that is facilitated</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.800" end="01:00:52.780" style="s2">well I guess in order to to you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.160" end="01:00:54.950" style="s2">answer that question regarding say is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.780" end="01:00:57.080" style="s2">voting currency a good system we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.950" end="01:01:00.410" style="s2">to say well what what are the effects of</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.080" end="01:01:03.410" style="s2">voting systems at all and how do we</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.410" end="01:01:05.300" style="s2">define what kind of choice should be</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.410" end="01:01:07.010" style="s2">benefited or are there different kinds</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.300" end="01:01:09.110" style="s2">of choices that need different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.010" end="01:01:10.430" style="s2">governance systems and how do we relate</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.110" end="01:01:12.220" style="s2">it to sense making so you start to find</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.430" end="01:01:14.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole taxonomy of questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.220" end="01:01:15.980" style="s2">underneath it that you just either</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.450" end="01:01:18.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t pay attention to or you assumed</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.980" end="01:01:20.000" style="s2">the answers to now everyone in the group</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.500" end="01:01:21.140" style="s2">will have different insights as to what</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:23.150" style="s2">questions what is the level of</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.140" end="01:01:24.650" style="s2">consciousness and and training of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.150" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">people that are involved in order to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.650" end="01:01:27.800" style="s2">able to engage in it how much civic</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">engagement training is necessary</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.800" end="01:01:33.950" style="s2">whatever at all these questions and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:35.780" style="s2">you also ask what underlying assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.950" end="01:01:37.310" style="s2">are there and what is ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.780" end="01:01:39.770" style="s2">meaningful that this is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.310" end="01:01:41.420" style="s2">address now as you go around in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.770" end="01:01:43.340" style="s2">structured process no one is actually</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.220" end="01:01:50.300" style="s2">question has these other questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.810" end="01:01:51.320" style="s2">connected and then everyone gets be like</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.300" end="01:01:53.240" style="s2">oh I wouldn&#39;t have even thought of</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.320" end="01:01:55.040" style="s2">that question oh that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.240" end="01:01:56.840" style="s2">and because we&#39;re not jumping straight</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.040" end="01:01:58.220" style="s2">to vote you don&#39;t get pissed off that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.840" end="01:01:59.330" style="s2">want this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.220" end="01:02:01.010" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s gonna take away from</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.330" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">your thing you get to say well yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.010" end="01:02:04.910" style="s2">guess spotted owls are interesting too</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:09.140" style="s2">right if there&#39;s a way of doing it that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.910" end="01:02:11.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t damage my kid getting a job and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.140" end="01:02:13.430" style="s2">oh I guess I do have that assumption</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.450" end="01:02:14.720" style="s2">underneath it and I guess this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.430" end="01:02:15.740" style="s2">actually what&#39;s meaningful to me well</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:17.030" style="s2">should the things that they said are</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.740" end="01:02:20.570" style="s2">meaningful to them or meaningful to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.030" end="01:02:22.490" style="s2">too so in the process not only does a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.570" end="01:02:24.260" style="s2">huge amount of information get surfaced</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.490" end="01:02:26.930" style="s2">that then can go into a choice making</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.260" end="01:02:29.510" style="s2">process they can lead to better choices</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.930" end="01:02:32.540" style="s2">but all of the people understood each</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.510" end="01:02:35.780" style="s2">other better and they actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.540" end="01:02:37.430" style="s2">understood how to do an aspect of we</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.780" end="01:02:40.280" style="s2">space better which is I understood how</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.430" end="01:02:41.900" style="s2">to notice their own assumptions how to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.280" end="01:02:44.210" style="s2">notice what&#39;s actually meaningful to</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.900" end="01:02:46.640" style="s2">them that is driving where their motion</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.210" end="01:02:48.260" style="s2">is and how to ask more questions and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.640" end="01:02:50.090" style="s2">they became more it you know educated</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.260" end="01:02:51.950" style="s2">about the topic and they after they do</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.090" end="01:02:54.230" style="s2">this a bunch of times they start to take</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.950" end="01:02:55.310" style="s2">for granted that there&#39;s a huge amount</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.230" end="01:02:56.890" style="s2">of stuff they don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.310" end="01:02:59.150" style="s2">everything they&#39;re passionate about and</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.890" end="01:03:00.470" style="s2">they start to take for granted that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.150" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">other people that have perspectives that</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.470" end="01:03:03.080" style="s2">they thought they would have differed</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:06.020" style="s2">with actually have meaningful things to</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.080" end="01:03:07.490" style="s2">share that they didn&#39;t know via going</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.020" end="01:03:09.530" style="s2">through that process so of course we end</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.490" end="01:03:10.849" style="s2">up surfacing some sense-making in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.530" end="01:03:12.380" style="s2">form of documents but we surface</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.849" end="01:03:15.470" style="s2">sense-making in the form of all of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.380" end="01:03:16.700" style="s2">people being better sense makers are you</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.470" end="01:03:18.470" style="s2">actually training a kind of civic</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.700" end="01:03:20.599" style="s2">engagement so when you ask what are some</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.470" end="01:03:22.580" style="s2">tools or processes to be able to help</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.599" end="01:03:26.420" style="s2">people actually connect and relate</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.580" end="01:03:29.750" style="s2">better that&#39;s this one example I just</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.420" end="01:03:31.460" style="s2">said okay so it&#39;s like by is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.750" end="01:03:33.320" style="s2">develop selves breaking by developing</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.460" end="01:03:35.420" style="s2">more sense making in the forms of</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.320" end="01:03:37.400" style="s2">questions and then starts by asking</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.420" end="01:03:40.070" style="s2">those questions and then helping people</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.400" end="01:03:42.470" style="s2">to actually relate first to that instead</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.070" end="01:03:44.720" style="s2">of trying to get into the answers I am</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.470" end="01:03:46.550" style="s2">by doing that they create some empathic</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.720" end="01:03:48.470" style="s2">connection because there&#39;s nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.550" end="01:03:50.300" style="s2">oppose there are just questions</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.470" end="01:03:54.800" style="s2">we&#39;re just surfacing that which we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.300" end="01:03:56.839" style="s2">know and then but then how do you go</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.800" end="01:03:58.180" style="s2">from that because you know in the in our</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.839" end="01:04:00.800" style="s2">when we do collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.180" end="01:04:03.349" style="s2">processes we can have all these huge</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.800" end="01:04:05.839" style="s2">amounts of data and this huge amount of</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.349" end="01:04:09.830" style="s2">harvesting but I tend to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.839" end="01:04:11.840" style="s2">like in form of a spiral right so we go</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.830" end="01:04:13.850" style="s2">from the outer to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.840" end="01:04:16.130" style="s2">inside and the inside is where we want</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.850" end="01:04:18.140" style="s2">to find that answer to our question and</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.130" end="01:04:20.990" style="s2">sometimes what happens is that people</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.140" end="01:04:23.030" style="s2">are not able to then see the whole of</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.990" end="01:04:26.300" style="s2">what is emerging in a way that makes</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.030" end="01:04:28.220" style="s2">sense we can develop a huge map but that</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.300" end="01:04:30.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean people will be able to make</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.220" end="01:04:33.110" style="s2">sense of that map so what is the process</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.980" end="01:04:35.990" style="s2">in which you going through that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.110" end="01:04:41.180" style="s2">huge amount of data and questions into</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.990" end="01:04:44.810" style="s2">the actual more focused way of sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.180" end="01:04:48.080" style="s2">making from that to this seeing what</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.810" end="01:04:50.600" style="s2">you&#39;re actually wanna see yeah so the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.080" end="01:04:53.210" style="s2">second simplicity on the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.600" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">the complexity is actually an integrated</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.210" end="01:04:58.790" style="s2">design itu surface all of this</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:05:00.080" style="s2">complexity of questions and of things</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.790" end="01:05:03.230" style="s2">that are meaningful and things that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.080" end="01:05:05.300" style="s2">matter right that&#39;s ultimately gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.230" end="01:05:08.300" style="s2">create a series of design constraints</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.300" end="01:05:10.460" style="s2">right for sure and then the design</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.300" end="01:05:13.670" style="s2">constraints are going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.460" end="01:05:15.980" style="s2">beginning of a integrated design process</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.670" end="01:05:17.720" style="s2">and the simplicity the choice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.980" end="01:05:21.740" style="s2">made is actually a design that meets all</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.720" end="01:05:23.660" style="s2">the design constraints and so the future</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.740" end="01:05:29.810" style="s2">of governance and economics actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.660" end="01:05:32.870" style="s2">here is around integrated design this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.810" end="01:05:36.530" style="s2">a really different thing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.870" end="01:05:38.270" style="s2">optimization and it&#39;s not game theory so</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.530" end="01:05:40.490" style="s2">when we think of optimization right we</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.270" end="01:05:43.880" style="s2">say okay we have a bit of a system and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.490" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of different needs</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.880" end="01:05:47.900" style="s2">that need met and I&#39;ve got you know I</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:49.190" style="s2">have my government budget my state</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.900" end="01:05:50.810" style="s2">budget or my federal budget or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.190" end="01:05:52.010" style="s2">it is and I&#39;ve got military needs and</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.810" end="01:05:53.180" style="s2">healthcare needs and all these things</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.010" end="01:05:54.200" style="s2">where I have a company and I have our</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.180" end="01:05:56.210" style="s2">total amount of money and I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.200" end="01:05:58.970" style="s2">marketing needs and HR needs and product</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.210" end="01:06:01.850" style="s2">needs and R&amp;D needs but now I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.970" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">allocate the resources the same scare</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.850" end="01:06:06.740" style="s2">seemingly competitive resources to each</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">of the different areas in light of what</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.740" end="01:06:09.500" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to do in that area how</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:10.970" style="s2">it all comes together that will create</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.500" end="01:06:13.540" style="s2">the best whole I&#39;m thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.970" end="01:06:18.200" style="s2">whole from an optimization point of view</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.540" end="01:06:19.970" style="s2">so we look for global Optimum&#39;s when we</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.200" end="01:06:21.260" style="s2">look for Nash equilibriums and things</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.970" end="01:06:24.020" style="s2">like that that&#39;s kind of how we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.260" end="01:06:26.020" style="s2">it that will definitely not work moving</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.020" end="01:06:30.250" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.020" end="01:06:34.690" style="s2">and for a few reasons</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.250" end="01:06:38.890" style="s2">one is when we think about optimization</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.690" end="01:06:40.720" style="s2">we are assuming that we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.890" end="01:06:43.420" style="s2">theory of trade-offs that the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.720" end="01:06:45.190" style="s2">resource going to this area is taking</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.420" end="01:06:46.869" style="s2">away from this area and coming here is</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.190" end="01:06:48.400" style="s2">taking away from this one which when you</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.869" end="01:06:49.540" style="s2">actually get into integrated design</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.400" end="01:06:51.940" style="s2">where you look at the synergy</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.540" end="01:06:54.040" style="s2">possibility of how can these things be</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.940" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">mutually beneficial it&#39;s not about how</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.040" end="01:06:57.099" style="s2">much resource goes here and here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:59.140" style="s2">about what is a design that works for</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.099" end="01:07:00.760" style="s2">both of these things together better</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.140" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">than the inside of either of them on</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.760" end="01:07:07.930" style="s2">their own would have and so as long as</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.440" end="01:07:10.210" style="s2">we have underlying theory of trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.930" end="01:07:12.490" style="s2">we will have people that are associating</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.210" end="01:07:15.010" style="s2">with whatever value metric they care</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.490" end="01:07:16.839" style="s2">about particularly and will continue to</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.010" end="01:07:18.099" style="s2">radicalize and polarize people just</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.839" end="01:07:21.430" style="s2">through the underlying theory of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.099" end="01:07:23.829" style="s2">trade-offs though the key is not how do</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.430" end="01:07:25.690" style="s2">we top-down allocate or how do we</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.829" end="01:07:28.390" style="s2">bottom-up have a bunch of agents that</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.690" end="01:07:30.579" style="s2">try to find Nash equilibriums it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.390" end="01:07:33.490" style="s2">does everyone surface what is ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.579" end="01:07:35.170" style="s2">meaningful to them and we take all these</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.490" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">sources of meaningfulness as design</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.170" end="01:07:40.480" style="s2">constraints and then we go into a</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:41.460" style="s2">collaborative design process with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.480" end="01:07:43.630" style="s2">people who have the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.460" end="01:07:46.359" style="s2">capabilities for that particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.630" end="01:07:48.490" style="s2">thing and a design that meets all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.359" end="01:07:52.839" style="s2">design constraints can move forward with</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.490" end="01:07:55.750" style="s2">consent Wow so that&#39;s how would you</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.839" end="01:07:57.970" style="s2">describe integrated design when we go</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.750" end="01:08:00.069" style="s2">from the sense making into identifying</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.970" end="01:08:03.700" style="s2">the design constraints and then we find</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.069" end="01:08:07.089" style="s2">the most simple elegant way of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.700" end="01:08:09.220" style="s2">those design constraints and what about</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.089" end="01:08:11.980" style="s2">paradox what about those design</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.220" end="01:08:14.290" style="s2">constraints that come from paradoxical</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.980" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">sets of needs some people may think they</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.290" end="01:08:18.040" style="s2">need this and another people think they</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.000" end="01:08:22.569" style="s2">need it and there&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.040" end="01:08:25.299" style="s2">opposition on that so always false</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.569" end="01:08:28.449" style="s2">dichotomy and the key there is to move</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.299" end="01:08:32.160" style="s2">from false dichotomy into dialectic and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.449" end="01:08:34.750" style="s2">then synthesis on the dialectic and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.160" end="01:08:36.600" style="s2">people&#39;s strategies for how to meet a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.750" end="01:08:38.890" style="s2">need will be fundamentally and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.600" end="01:08:40.390" style="s2">reconcilable but the actual need</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.890" end="01:08:42.730" style="s2">will not be fundamentally unreconciled</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.390" end="01:08:44.260" style="s2">so we have to be able to tease apart the</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.730" end="01:08:47.230" style="s2">strategy for how to meet the need in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.260" end="01:08:48.850" style="s2">actual need and so this is again where</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.230" end="01:08:52.120" style="s2">we get into assumptions right there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.850" end="01:08:56.080" style="s2">assumption that this particular strategy</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.120" end="01:08:58.810" style="s2">is the way to meet that need and there</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.080" end="01:09:01.360" style="s2">is a meaningful - right what is actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.810" end="01:09:03.490" style="s2">meaningful here well ok so my strategy</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.360" end="01:09:05.020" style="s2">to meet the need for freedom is lays a</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.490" end="01:09:07.030" style="s2">fair free market capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.020" end="01:09:10.360" style="s2">well no but my strategy for the way of</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.030" end="01:09:12.190" style="s2">meeting my need for tending to though</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.360" end="01:09:16.120" style="s2">tending to the disabled and those who</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.190" end="01:09:18.520" style="s2">are in you know harder off positions and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.120" end="01:09:21.160" style="s2">tending to the Commons as Marxism well</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.520" end="01:09:23.980" style="s2">no let&#39;s let go of the strategies and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.160" end="01:09:26.800" style="s2">say what I care about is individual</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.980" end="01:09:29.830" style="s2">freedom and sovereignty and the creative</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.800" end="01:09:31.750" style="s2">capacity of the individual what I care</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.830" end="01:09:33.850" style="s2">about is the Commons and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.750" end="01:09:35.710" style="s2">Commonwealth and those who are not in</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.850" end="01:09:37.090" style="s2">positions to be able to fully take care</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.710" end="01:09:39.600" style="s2">of themselves sovereignly being taken</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.090" end="01:09:41.610" style="s2">care of great those are not in</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.600" end="01:09:44.560" style="s2">fundamental dichotomy with each other</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.610" end="01:09:46.990" style="s2">but the strategies to fulfill that might</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.560" end="01:09:48.670" style="s2">be in fundamental dichotomy so we come</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.990" end="01:09:50.440" style="s2">to what is fundamentally meaningful and</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.670" end="01:09:52.960" style="s2">ultimately what we end up finding is</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.440" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">that the same things are meaningful to</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:57.970" style="s2">everyone that&#39;s not obvious at all but</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:09:59.260" style="s2">everything that is actually meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.970" end="01:10:03.250" style="s2">when you strip the strategy away is</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.260" end="01:10:05.020" style="s2">meaningful to everyone now that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.250" end="01:10:06.760" style="s2">process of Revelation that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.020" end="01:10:09.430" style="s2">all have the same values which is all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.760" end="01:10:13.240" style="s2">them right everything fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.430" end="01:10:17.230" style="s2">valuable then we get to say how do we do</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.240" end="01:10:19.150" style="s2">an integrated design strategy it meets</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.230" end="01:10:21.460" style="s2">both of these things simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.150" end="01:10:24.040" style="s2">takes them out of being seen as</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.460" end="01:10:26.470" style="s2">paradoxical right out of being seen as</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.040" end="01:10:29.160" style="s2">fundamentally dichotomous because we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.470" end="01:10:29.160" style="s2">meet them both simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.340" end="01:10:49.640" style="s2">I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re in this world they</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.880" end="01:10:51.380" style="s2">mail and - so how far is this initiative</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.640" end="01:10:53.570" style="s2">and is there gonna be tools or is there</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.380" end="01:10:56.930" style="s2">gonna be a process that will help people</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.570" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">to do the sense-making and and and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.930" end="01:11:01.610" style="s2">plan to release that process or is there</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">a certain technology certain tool that</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.610" end="01:11:05.630" style="s2">would help to do that and in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:08.600" style="s2">beginning I think I heard you say</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.630" end="01:11:10.730" style="s2">sensors but that I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.600" end="01:11:15.080" style="s2">applies to sense-making or to actual</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.730" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">sensors yes there I was saying human</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.080" end="01:11:19.390" style="s2">sensors meaning that we&#39;re not in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">particular process we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.390" end="01:11:25.670" style="s2">humans as things that have sensed into</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:27.440" style="s2">the world around them and can then share</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.670" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">their sense making and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.440" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">way of being able to synthesize very</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:37.790" style="s2">harvesting something as opposed to sense</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:40.100" style="s2">making from say data mining on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.790" end="01:11:41.900" style="s2">internet or physical sensors which are</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.100" end="01:11:46.220" style="s2">also important and where you know they</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.900" end="01:11:49.040" style="s2">those all need combined when we start to</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.220" end="01:11:50.930" style="s2">talk about the future of infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:58.370" style="s2">physical sensors are actually a major</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.930" end="01:12:00.200" style="s2">part of a self adapting system the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.370" end="01:12:02.450" style="s2">system I was just sharing of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.200" end="01:12:05.780" style="s2">small group sense making process has</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.450" end="01:12:07.070" style="s2">gone through architecture which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.780" end="01:12:10.100" style="s2">actually very non-trivial as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.070" end="01:12:13.070" style="s2">hearing it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a small</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.100" end="01:12:15.230" style="s2">adaptation of holacracy or so she offers</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.070" end="01:12:17.240" style="s2">here some other thing it was starting by</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.230" end="01:12:21.770" style="s2">reverse engineering from the actual</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.240" end="01:12:23.570" style="s2">social dynamic means and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.770" end="01:12:26.540" style="s2">there&#39;s several different processes that</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.570" end="01:12:28.190" style="s2">was one of them and just started to go</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.540" end="01:12:30.350" style="s2">into prototyping and now there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.190" end="01:12:34.040" style="s2">of prototype work to do and I would</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.350" end="01:12:35.420" style="s2">actually love to have people from the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.040" end="01:12:39.320" style="s2">you know collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.420" end="01:12:41.600" style="s2">communities especially if they were</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.320" end="01:12:43.850" style="s2">interested in helping to develop these</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.600" end="01:12:48.220" style="s2">things further to do so because you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.850" end="01:12:49.370" style="s2">a lot of work is needed yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.220" end="01:12:50.810" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.370" end="01:12:53.990" style="s2">just as you were saying that I was</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.810" end="01:12:56.180" style="s2">thinking about how to then enhance the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.990" end="01:12:58.790" style="s2">capacity of the sensors right and how do</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.180" end="01:13:00.230" style="s2">you do that when you enter in collecting</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.790" end="01:13:02.750" style="s2">intelligence because we can operate here</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.230" end="01:13:04.280" style="s2">and we can interview our fears or we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.750" end="01:13:06.770" style="s2">enter through our emotion or we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.280" end="01:13:08.720" style="s2">enter that we can bring our whole selves</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.770" end="01:13:10.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s literally all the good and</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.720" end="01:13:13.730" style="s2">the bad and the ugly and the beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.160" end="01:13:16.340" style="s2">and and so when you prepare a collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.730" end="01:13:19.880" style="s2">field like if you think about the we</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.340" end="01:13:22.970" style="s2">spaces preview part of who over the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.880" end="01:13:26.540" style="s2">practices are developing collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.970" end="01:13:28.970" style="s2">sentence I&#39;m developing a way on on how</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.540" end="01:13:31.130" style="s2">we connect to each other so deeply but</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.970" end="01:13:32.300" style="s2">also to the center to do that which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.130" end="01:13:36.700" style="s2">bigger than ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.300" end="01:13:40.010" style="s2">and then through that when we have</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.700" end="01:13:42.680" style="s2">reached a certain space where where were</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.010" end="01:13:45.470" style="s2">literally buzzing it would literally</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.680" end="01:13:49.280" style="s2">feel the space is impregnated with our</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.470" end="01:13:51.710" style="s2">beingness together with our easiness in</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.280" end="01:13:54.650" style="s2">that particular moment of the collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.710" end="01:13:56.750" style="s2">and then we go to the mind then more</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.650" end="01:13:58.480" style="s2">powerful things can happen and I feel</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.750" end="01:14:01.190" style="s2">that bad when you mix that and</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.480" end="01:14:03.770" style="s2">experience when you mix that with music</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.190" end="01:14:05.540" style="s2">let&#39;s say that in a certain point the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.770" end="01:14:07.640" style="s2">group reach the limit of their sensing</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.540" end="01:14:10.910" style="s2">and then you bring an important piece of</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.640" end="01:14:13.190" style="s2">music or art or so that that you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.910" end="01:14:15.620" style="s2">meant the possibilities of the right</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.190" end="01:14:18.110" style="s2">brain and left brain interaction in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.620" end="01:14:20.630" style="s2">space and the body so I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.110" end="01:14:22.700" style="s2">it would have to be larger than the mind</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.630" end="01:14:25.670" style="s2">it would have to involve all of who we</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.700" end="01:14:28.250" style="s2">are so that our sense source are really</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.670" end="01:14:32.690" style="s2">fully activated and that would be my</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.250" end="01:14:35.630" style="s2">answer I think that is beautiful and</p>

<p begin="01:15:34.180" end="01:15:39.190" style="s2">and then all dance together and have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.180" end="01:15:40.870" style="s2">sniper party and like it connect them</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.190" end="01:15:42.820" style="s2">that way and then they do strategy and</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.870" end="01:15:44.590" style="s2">there are other groups of autists who</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.820" end="01:15:48.370" style="s2">actually do really good strategy</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.590" end="01:15:52.900" style="s2">together just by starting with data and</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.370" end="01:15:54.730" style="s2">so I want to make it as deep and rich as</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.900" end="01:15:58.300" style="s2">possible and as widely appealing as</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.730" end="01:16:01.150" style="s2">possible thank you that addresses that</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.300" end="01:16:03.370" style="s2">we are unique and that there is these</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.150" end="01:16:06.040" style="s2">places for uniqueness and then the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.370" end="01:16:08.410" style="s2">places where certain groups I think that</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.040" end="01:16:12.790" style="s2">that you know one of the recordings that</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.410" end="01:16:15.880" style="s2">that I did on fury of the embodied we</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.790" end="01:16:20.710" style="s2">with Erik Hersman or our God and they</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.880" end="01:16:23.380" style="s2">were speaking about certain practices</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.710" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">like game shifting to make some words</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.380" end="01:16:27.400" style="s2">that create collective awareness of</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:30.070" style="s2">where we are at so it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.400" end="01:16:32.320" style="s2">immediate sense making while we are in</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.070" end="01:16:35.710" style="s2">process to know if we have bypassed</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.320" end="01:16:38.080" style="s2">something that that we actually wanted</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.710" end="01:16:40.930" style="s2">to agree upon in the in the moment how</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.080" end="01:16:43.239" style="s2">help us keep our agreements in the field</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.930" end="01:16:46.540" style="s2">help us know where we&#39;re at in regards</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.239" end="01:16:49.330" style="s2">to a process in any given moment jumping</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.540" end="01:16:52.060" style="s2">from example from a facilitated fully</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.330" end="01:16:55.690" style="s2">facilitated group to oh now we&#39;re girl</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.060" end="01:16:59.380" style="s2">facilitating or now we&#39;re popcorn doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.690" end="01:17:01.810" style="s2">popcorn oh now we need to to dive deeper</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.380" end="01:17:03.760" style="s2">into ourselves and connect vertically</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.810" end="01:17:05.950" style="s2">and we want to soar so let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.760" end="01:17:07.060" style="s2">brief before breath before we speak and</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.950" end="01:17:09.390" style="s2">let&#39;s try to make the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.060" end="01:17:11.860" style="s2">slower and that but then you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.390" end="01:17:14.190" style="s2">dynamically do that</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.860" end="01:17:17.190" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like in in a way</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.190" end="01:17:19.710" style="s2">you could have you know boards that</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.190" end="01:17:22.830" style="s2">could that could show that that could</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.710" end="01:17:25.350" style="s2">indicate where the collective is at in</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.830" end="01:17:28.080" style="s2">any given moment and individual words</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.350" end="01:17:33.300" style="s2">that could indicate where you are at in</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.080" end="01:17:38.000" style="s2">any individual moment yes and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.300" end="01:17:38.000" style="s2">tricky because when we think about</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.540" end="01:17:47.430" style="s2">complex when we think about complex</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.880" end="01:17:49.380" style="s2">adaptive systems and the kind of mmm</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.430" end="01:17:53.190" style="s2">merging changing flowing dynamics that</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.380" end="01:17:55.170" style="s2">can occur right if we look at at bees</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.190" end="01:18:00.540" style="s2">and termites and ants and flocks and</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.170" end="01:18:04.380" style="s2">schools like you mentioned earlier they</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.540" end="01:18:07.140" style="s2">don&#39;t have prefrontal cortices and in</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.380" end="01:18:09.150" style="s2">the stigma jeddak dynamics that do hive</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.140" end="01:18:12.210" style="s2">intelligence that can be that adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.150" end="01:18:16.020" style="s2">all of the members of the hive are</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.210" end="01:18:20.550" style="s2">fungible to each other right they there</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.020" end="01:18:22.380" style="s2">is no uniqueness of activity or role</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.550" end="01:18:24.150" style="s2">based on the individual they all can do</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.380" end="01:18:25.830" style="s2">exactly the same thing so they which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.150" end="01:18:27.120" style="s2">why sting or G works as a signaling</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.830" end="01:18:29.969" style="s2">system because they&#39;ll all do the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.120" end="01:18:31.469" style="s2">thing to the same signal it&#39;s also why</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.969" end="01:18:35.670" style="s2">they&#39;re fairly expendable as part of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.469" end="01:18:37.350" style="s2">strategy of the hive but it&#39;s also why</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.670" end="01:18:38.460" style="s2">they can count on each other to they can</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.350" end="01:18:41.100" style="s2">pretty much know what the one intern of</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.460" end="01:18:43.199" style="s2">them is going to do now when we come</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.100" end="01:18:44.670" style="s2">into a situation and people have very</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.199" end="01:18:46.230" style="s2">different learning styles and they have</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.670" end="01:18:48.330" style="s2">different skills and different</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.230" end="01:18:50.100" style="s2">attributes and so much so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.330" end="01:18:54.270" style="s2">into full kind of uniqueness of self</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.100" end="01:18:55.620" style="s2">then I can&#39;t assume that these six</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.270" end="01:18:58.650" style="s2">people are going to operate at all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.620" end="01:19:00.540" style="s2">same as the last six that I had which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.650" end="01:19:01.860" style="s2">why command and control hierarchy has</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.540" end="01:19:03.420" style="s2">worked so else is just all that</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.860" end="01:19:04.770" style="s2">complexity let&#39;s make a complicated</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.420" end="01:19:06.570" style="s2">system that we can rule and let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.770" end="01:19:08.430" style="s2">people fungible let&#39;s make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.570" end="01:19:09.690" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s had an MBA can do these</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.430" end="01:19:11.969" style="s2">things and everyone who&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.690" end="01:19:14.250" style="s2">assembly line can do these things but of</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.969" end="01:19:16.830" style="s2">course that system is end-of-life right</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.250" end="01:19:18.239" style="s2">and and running out so one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.830" end="01:19:19.590" style="s2">I would say is that as we move in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.239" end="01:19:22.770" style="s2">systems where we have to have more</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.590" end="01:19:26.910" style="s2">complex and inner dynamical you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.770" end="01:19:30.750" style="s2">relationships we&#39;ve got to learn to</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.910" end="01:19:33.570" style="s2">listen so much better and to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.750" end="01:19:38.760" style="s2">so much better and to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.570" end="01:19:41.070" style="s2">actually adapt to different processes</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.760" end="01:19:44.970" style="s2">and different people which requires real</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.070" end="01:19:47.160" style="s2">authentic full communication and so this</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.970" end="01:19:48.450" style="s2">is where you&#39;re saying what is the what</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.160" end="01:19:52.200" style="s2">is the development at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.450" end="01:19:58.410" style="s2">individuals needed to make those kinds</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.200" end="01:20:01.680" style="s2">of processes effective a lot Wow I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.410" end="01:20:03.990" style="s2">gonna rap because we&#39;ve been going on</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.680" end="01:20:05.850" style="s2">and of course we can keep going on and</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.990" end="01:20:09.660" style="s2">it&#39;s just so beautiful but I want a name</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.850" end="01:20:14.070" style="s2">into that last piece just said on this</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.660" end="01:20:17.640" style="s2">make it really presence that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.070" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">be listening better that we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.640" end="01:20:24.360" style="s2">then developing our sensing capacities</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:27.600" style="s2">and our scent source and our way to</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.360" end="01:20:30.420" style="s2">receive signals so that we can become</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.600" end="01:20:33.680" style="s2">better players over that we space of</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.420" end="01:20:36.210" style="s2">that collective and that is a beautiful</p>
