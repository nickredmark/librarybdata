<p begin="00:00:07.740" end="00:00:12.900" style="s2">interpretation of that is possibly not</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.240" end="00:00:14.490" style="s2">kind right but there&#39;s a lot of rules we</p>

<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">unwritten rules so as someone who maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t great at recognizing them until</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">they&#39;ve been pointed out to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:34.500" style="s2">being like okay I can do that some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">the time I would really like it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.500" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">etiquette guide and I think that at</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">least shows in the difficulty in doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:42.660" style="s2">it like can ask okay well when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:46.110" style="s2">someone&#39;s house do you bring a bottle of</p>

<p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:50.129" style="s2">you&#39;d be rude not to ten percent are</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">like if they&#39;re not alcoholics and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.129" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">think 10 percent would be like like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">would plant is a better option whatever</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">it happens to be you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">crowdsource the actual etiquette so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">at least when you get angry that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">somebody didn&#39;t bring a bottle of wine</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">or that somebody did you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">actually 80% of people agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">this is like holding the audience but on</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">everyday etiquette and then also with</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">that and similar to knowing laws all</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">around the world doing the etiquette all</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">around the world where you know I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">Vancouver and one of our local</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">etiquettes that it annoys among people</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">who aren&#39;t here do and I&#39;m like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">they&#39;re not from here maybe they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:27.720" style="s2">know they don&#39;t take the schedule is on</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">the SkyTrain site it&#39;s the sky train</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.720" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">escalators especially you walk left and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">stand right it is even I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:36.119" style="s2">they&#39;re actually at the newer sky trains</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">but they&#39;re definitely at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.119" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">sky dreams those signs and so because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">that and so many people use the sky</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">train then becomes customary at any</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">elevator that would allow two-way</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:47.659" style="s2">traffic so which you look at stand</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">beside each other that you walk left is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.659" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">walk left and right and so yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">having a local etiquette guide would</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:58.340" style="s2">also be wonderful</p>
