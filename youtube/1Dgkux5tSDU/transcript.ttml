<p begin="00:01:54.800" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">day I see that but I find him interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.300" end="00:02:01.460" style="s2">with the film because I saw the film</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:03.680" style="s2">like before the departure or before the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.460" end="00:02:05.570" style="s2">the awareness of the departure that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.680" end="00:02:07.790" style="s2">makes sense and I was with monitoring</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.570" end="00:02:10.549" style="s2">people&#39;s reactions to it and depending</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.790" end="00:02:11.690" style="s2">on like your viewpoint you people were</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.549" end="00:02:14.690" style="s2">getting completely different vibes in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.690" end="00:02:16.340" style="s2">the film some people it&#39;s scared like</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.690" end="00:02:17.690" style="s2">some people were quite terrified at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.340" end="00:02:20.510" style="s2">end some people have got this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.690" end="00:02:22.040" style="s2">like like dark thing from it it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.510" end="00:02:25.549" style="s2">really I think it was very kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.040" end="00:02:26.389" style="s2">made in that it didn&#39;t present itself in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.549" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">any fashion</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.389" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">other than being a document and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">essentially you see in it what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:34.830" style="s2">used to the reflection as in you see</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.030" end="00:02:36.209" style="s2">your own biases or what have you coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.830" end="00:02:40.159" style="s2">through and you get and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.209" end="00:02:42.690" style="s2">it was impartial I fell yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.159" end="00:02:44.489" style="s2">if you go if you search reactions around</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">Twitter some people were terrified by it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.489" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">some people saw a very clear document of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.400" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">a deliberate like Messiah type thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">being Bill deliberately they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:03:02.760" style="s2">see out of that documentary yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">and what did you get out of it I felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:10.200" style="s2">like it was the first part of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">beautiful trilogy oh you know we talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.200" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">about this stuff you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:15.060" style="s2">everything&#39;s in stories and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">completely sense that you boy piece and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.060" end="00:03:22.650" style="s2">would have his whole life become a sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">of archetypal story it was like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.650" end="00:03:29.549" style="s2">first Star Wars maybe right yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:33.780" style="s2">got you basically launched a mini wave</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.549" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">thing with Peterson so the first song I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.780" end="00:03:39.209" style="s2">did that you would call me wave I did</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:41.010" style="s2">low as a proto meaning wave like my</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.209" end="00:03:43.859" style="s2">whole life I made songs that sampled</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.010" end="00:03:45.269" style="s2">people talking but the first song he</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.859" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">would go meaning wave was indeed a song</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.269" end="00:03:49.019" style="s2">the sample Jordan Peterson talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:52.859" style="s2">the importance of being a really good</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.019" end="00:03:55.109" style="s2">plumber you you know which really struck</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.859" end="00:03:56.940" style="s2">me at 4:00 in the morning half-baked</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.109" end="00:03:59.220" style="s2">coming back from DJing in West Hollywood</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.569" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">being on and you certainly starts</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.489" end="00:04:09.500" style="s2">talking about you know be a plumber be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:11.549" style="s2">good one and it really hit me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.500" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">really hit me I was like damn I need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.549" end="00:04:14.760" style="s2">sample this right now that&#39;s just epic</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:16.680" style="s2">be a plumber be a good work because if</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.760" end="00:04:18.570" style="s2">you had to notice something about him</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.680" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">talking about the importance of just</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.570" end="00:04:24.030" style="s2">like you know just doing an honest thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:25.500" style="s2">I mean the power of that in the world it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.030" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">seems like in it seems like an odd thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.500" end="00:04:29.400" style="s2">that would be the thing that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:32.729" style="s2">really spark complete inspiration but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.400" end="00:04:34.020" style="s2">did three things out that week and one</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.729" end="00:04:35.849" style="s2">of them was there and one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.020" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">attract that sampled grand theft auto</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.849" end="00:04:41.099" style="s2">san andreas all you had to do was follow</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">the damn train CJ some people mean you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.099" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:46.889" style="s2">and another song about the Welsh notion</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:48.629" style="s2">of Hittites which is a nostalgic for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.889" end="00:04:52.979" style="s2">place that doesn&#39;t exist anymore</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.629" end="00:04:57.509" style="s2">and uh three songs and uh that one was</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.979" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">the one that reading resonated yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.509" end="00:05:04.409" style="s2">began that Jimmy so I have two questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">and I have a strategy I want to share</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.409" end="00:05:09.479" style="s2">with you if everyone has any questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:11.159" style="s2">just write in the chat box or any</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.479" end="00:05:13.259" style="s2">statements and then I&#39;ll calling you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.159" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">meet yourself so the first question then</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.259" end="00:05:18.599" style="s2">I&#39;ll make I&#39;ll share the strategy is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.990" end="00:05:20.759" style="s2">we&#39;re talking okay so I mention this in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.599" end="00:05:22.529" style="s2">the last session that so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.759" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">Peterson that client for two years and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.529" end="00:05:26.189" style="s2">the last my last session with him was</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:27.599" style="s2">when he released a pronoun video</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.189" end="00:05:31.169" style="s2">actually just worked out like that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.599" end="00:05:32.550" style="s2">then he&#39;s just famous but just before I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.169" end="00:05:33.629" style="s2">saw him I started to see him as a client</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.550" end="00:05:35.969" style="s2">so basically two years before he came</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.629" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">famous I was saying to buddy of mine</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.969" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">like how come this guy is not more</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.770" end="00:05:41.340" style="s2">famous right now is he in toronto he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.870" end="00:05:42.689" style="s2">like an indie band like you know people</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.340" end="00:05:44.759" style="s2">kind of knew him but he wasn&#39;t that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.689" end="00:05:46.500" style="s2">popular then now I was like how&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.759" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">guy this fucking famous it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:51.000" style="s2">yeah he says he&#39;s he says things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:53.129" style="s2">are good but it&#39;s like it&#39;s not like big</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.000" end="00:05:54.509" style="s2">like groundbreaking in a way but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.129" end="00:05:56.460" style="s2">like there&#39;s like a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.509" end="00:05:59.250" style="s2">things about him that makes him special</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.460" end="00:06:01.289" style="s2">so I&#39;m curious what your thoughts have</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.250" end="00:06:03.150" style="s2">been why Peterson was the guy that had</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.289" end="00:06:05.009" style="s2">such a force in this culture and had</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.150" end="00:06:08.099" style="s2">such controversy and polarization around</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.009" end="00:06:10.860" style="s2">him well it&#39;s the thing I always say and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.099" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">people people forget certain people</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.860" end="00:06:14.759" style="s2">having these sorts of comforts that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:17.879" style="s2">conversations forget that it&#39;s pointless</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.759" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">to preach to the choir you want to reach</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.879" end="00:06:23.819" style="s2">the normies and you want to reach people</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.330" end="00:06:26.689" style="s2">outside the choir and a Peterson had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.819" end="00:06:29.699" style="s2">way of communicating quite complex epic</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.689" end="00:06:32.339" style="s2">ideas to regular people in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.699" end="00:06:34.919" style="s2">they could understand and in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.339" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">they felt was genuine he&#39;s not talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.919" end="00:06:41.779" style="s2">down to you he&#39;s not talking in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:44.430" style="s2">that&#39;s overtly unnecessarily complicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.779" end="00:06:47.339" style="s2">he has a way of boiling down quite big</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.430" end="00:06:49.399" style="s2">ideas into concepts that you can grip if</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.339" end="00:06:52.649" style="s2">you&#39;re RIT like a regular person</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.399" end="00:06:54.180" style="s2">you know so he had that going for it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.649" end="00:06:55.210" style="s2">then on the other side he had this</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.180" end="00:06:57.960" style="s2">wonderful knack of getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.210" end="00:07:00.910" style="s2">in some kind of an epic drama every week</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.960" end="00:07:03.550" style="s2">you know which that&#39;s the milkshake that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.910" end="00:07:05.620" style="s2">brings all the boys to be yard you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.550" end="00:07:07.870" style="s2">is that drama so you being a new beef</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.620" end="00:07:09.699" style="s2">every week and he be getting he got a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.870" end="00:07:11.949" style="s2">new supervillain enemy to fight every</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.699" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">week so you know that became exciting</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.949" end="00:07:15.490" style="s2">and then people would go and so some</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:16.990" style="s2">people would tune in for the drama but</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.490" end="00:07:19.330" style="s2">then they would stay for the epic back</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.990" end="00:07:21.160" style="s2">catalog of bangers there was his YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.330" end="00:07:26.710" style="s2">channel there was stuffed full of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.160" end="00:07:28.990" style="s2">lectures of just breaking down the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.710" end="00:07:33.849" style="s2">in terms that atheists could understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.990" end="00:07:35.770" style="s2">like he reintroduced Western culture to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.849" end="00:07:37.110" style="s2">generations of people who didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.770" end="00:07:39.190" style="s2">nothing about it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.110" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">which is why I can compare him with</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.190" end="00:07:42.610" style="s2">what&#39;s because walleston what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:43.780" style="s2">introduced Eastern culture to people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.610" end="00:07:45.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t know nothing about it and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.780" end="00:07:47.770" style="s2">you had two generations of Western</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.910" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">people who didn&#39;t really have Western</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.770" end="00:07:54.190" style="s2">culture explain to them in a way other</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:56.590" style="s2">than it&#39;s bad okay you know and he came</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.190" end="00:07:59.130" style="s2">in and he&#39;s like in the similar way say</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.590" end="00:08:01.449" style="s2">like Joseph Campbell came in and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.130" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">translated things he translated old</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.449" end="00:08:05.500" style="s2">things in a way that made sense now</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:07.720" style="s2">and Petersen did something similar but</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.500" end="00:08:11.139" style="s2">he had the anat added bonus of all that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.720" end="00:08:11.740" style="s2">drama he did the 50s damn thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.139" end="00:08:13.719" style="s2">said this before</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.740" end="00:08:19.259" style="s2">he used exactly the same playbook than</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.719" end="00:08:21.550" style="s2">50 cent did and 6-9 more recently and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.259" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">they could continue something we talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.550" end="00:08:26.620" style="s2">about a previous conversation we had</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:27.699" style="s2">like so when I was as a client used to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.620" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">go to his office and he had all this</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.699" end="00:08:32.979" style="s2">books and then a bookshelf to the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:35.140" style="s2">had this whole section on hell on serial</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.979" end="00:08:36.219" style="s2">killers evil all this time is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.140" end="00:08:39.550" style="s2">like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.219" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">and and when I sort of like I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.550" end="00:08:43.029" style="s2">talking to you like I&#39;m following this</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:44.350" style="s2">energy I&#39;m calling the Dame on and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.029" end="00:08:47.140" style="s2">like the Dame on sort of leads you to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.350" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">like demonic energies and you actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.140" end="00:08:50.050" style="s2">feel like when you&#39;re following that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:51.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like sounds a woo to some people</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.050" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s like this primordial language</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.370" end="00:08:56.950" style="s2">that you&#39;re speaking and Peterson speaks</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:58.899" style="s2">that language I feel it&#39;s like you feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.950" end="00:09:00.490" style="s2">his fucking words we&#39;re all these sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.899" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">of like disembodied intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.490" end="00:09:02.380" style="s2">they&#39;re just talking from like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">monotone</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.380" end="00:09:07.329" style="s2">space and I feel you&#39;re plugged into</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:09.100" style="s2">that primordial language as well or you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.329" end="00:09:12.700" style="s2">can write</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.100" end="00:09:15.310" style="s2">Segan it&#39;s the conduit saying yes like</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.700" end="00:09:17.020" style="s2">you because if you if you if you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.310" end="00:09:19.510" style="s2">into that zone if you get particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.020" end="00:09:22.120" style="s2">good enough a thing and if u fokin a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.510" end="00:09:24.430" style="s2">focus off focus enough on that thing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.120" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">doing that thing you know what do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.430" end="00:09:26.440" style="s2">spend forty years thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.720" end="00:09:28.750" style="s2">same fuckin thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.440" end="00:09:30.580" style="s2">in incredibly obsessive detail and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.750" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">reading everything about it I&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.580" end="00:09:34.630" style="s2">decades on this music thing the similar</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">way if you just keep doing that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.630" end="00:09:38.530" style="s2">become a conduit for something alan</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:39.970" style="s2">moore used to call it idea space or</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.530" end="00:09:42.070" style="s2">whatever grande Morrison calls it a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.970" end="00:09:44.830" style="s2">fifth dimension whatever like you become</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.070" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">a conduit so that whatever that is and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.830" end="00:09:49.150" style="s2">if you are pure in your intention of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:50.830" style="s2">where have you that just comes through</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.150" end="00:09:53.290" style="s2">and people fucking recognize that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.830" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">it&#39;s undeniable it&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.290" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">can&#39;t be copied yes that&#39;s what happened</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:01.870" style="s2">with the IDW things lots of people try</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:04.690" style="s2">to like get them get that but they</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.870" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">couldn&#39;t because they were not fucking</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.690" end="00:10:09.820" style="s2">conduits in that fashion for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:11.140" style="s2">reason it&#39;s like not a thing it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.820" end="00:10:13.380" style="s2">thing you can copy and it&#39;s not a thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.140" end="00:10:17.530" style="s2">you can do over the course of a weekend</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.380" end="00:10:19.720" style="s2">yeah that way and some people study and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.530" end="00:10:21.730" style="s2">some people have an accident it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.720" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">what any kind of superpower you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.730" end="00:10:25.690" style="s2">someone falls into a very vast it you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:27.970" style="s2">know somebody builds a fucking machine</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.690" end="00:10:29.500" style="s2">and spends a long time doing it someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.970" end="00:10:34.810" style="s2">has some cosmic rays or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.500" end="00:10:37.510" style="s2">fuck it is or someone&#39;s born a mutant so</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.810" end="00:10:39.840" style="s2">here&#39;s the strategy I agree with that by</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.510" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">the way but here&#39;s the strategy</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.840" end="00:10:46.300" style="s2">so Jordan Hall reached out to John</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:47.830" style="s2">breaking and I and this is it was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.300" end="00:10:50.740" style="s2">of synchronicity surrounding this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.830" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">the idea is to get Peterson into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:10:55.240" style="s2">private conversation in dialog O&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:10:58.690" style="s2">John and a few other people in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.240" end="00:11:00.340" style="s2">making web before he enters into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:03.010" style="s2">sort of the culture war or whatever if</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.340" end="00:11:04.420" style="s2">we can kind of do that move in order to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.010" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">push him at his edge of his thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:07.000" style="s2">two phases</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:10.660" style="s2">maybe postmodern shadows or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.000" end="00:11:12.370" style="s2">is and on a sense that I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.660" end="00:11:13.870" style="s2">you could help with that but anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.370" end="00:11:19.780" style="s2">that resonates with you with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.870" end="00:11:22.540" style="s2">strategy what has anyone spoken to him</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.780" end="00:11:25.540" style="s2">there&#39;s anyone like Larry</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.540" end="00:11:27.730" style="s2">yahuwah was his re-entry plan is there</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.540" end="00:11:29.020" style="s2">anything like that people were where</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.730" end="00:11:35.220" style="s2">where is that but they don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.020" end="00:11:38.530" style="s2">does reentry plan is and i think we yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.220" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">those it wasn&#39;t I mean if you want any</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.530" end="00:11:42.460" style="s2">more specifics about topics or anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:44.560" style="s2">of that nature or the way you would like</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.460" end="00:11:46.030" style="s2">to do it or whatever forum or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.560" end="00:11:49.300" style="s2">kind of thing it is I know he&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.030" end="00:11:50.260" style="s2">homies with rocky anyway right yeah so</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.110" end="00:12:02.560" style="s2">Peterson they had a lot of disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.340" end="00:12:04.210" style="s2">but there was respect and then Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:05.770" style="s2">just and then reveille he too started</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.210" end="00:12:07.930" style="s2">coming on the scene recently in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.770" end="00:12:09.580" style="s2">a kind of a sense making rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.930" end="00:12:15.400" style="s2">space with his meeting crisis series</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.110" end="00:18:26.950" style="s2">book writer and a friend of mine and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.520" end="00:18:28.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve learnt a lot of his processes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.950" end="00:18:29.740" style="s2">what-have-you from hanging out with him</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.270" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2">and he wrote a comic book called the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.740" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">Invisibles which was a cent which was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.780" end="00:18:36.790" style="s2">deliberate hyper sigil designed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:40.300" style="s2">change the world in which the lead</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.790" end="00:18:41.590" style="s2">character was an insert of him and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.300" end="00:18:43.600" style="s2">kept putting this character in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.590" end="00:18:45.160" style="s2">situations and those things would then</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.600" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">happen in his life two or three months</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.160" end="00:18:48.340" style="s2">later which is how long it takes to put</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:50.260" style="s2">a fucking comic out so it&#39;s like once it</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.340" end="00:18:52.030" style="s2">goes in the world it gets supercharged</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.260" end="00:18:55.900" style="s2">it seems to the point that he had his</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.030" end="00:18:57.490" style="s2">character being tortured and given</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.900" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">essentially a flesh-eating disease and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.490" end="00:19:03.100" style="s2">then he got it in real life and nearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">died in the same situation you put his</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.100" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">character into so after that happened he</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:09.820" style="s2">started writing his character just into</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:11.770" style="s2">having audience and and then that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.820" end="00:19:12.730" style="s2">started happening in his life yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.770" end="00:19:13.990" style="s2">gotta be careful with the shit man</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.730" end="00:19:15.910" style="s2">because again as we were just saying the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.990" end="00:19:21.700" style="s2">closer you are to the source the closer</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.910" end="00:19:24.910" style="s2">that shit comes to actually affecting</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.700" end="00:19:33.610" style="s2">the fucking physics of your life thank</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.910" end="00:19:42.280" style="s2">you for your art so we have for about 10</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.610" end="00:19:44.020" style="s2">minutes left six six so we were talking</p>
