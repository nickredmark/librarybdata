<p begin="00:00:54.449" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">I did not write it down though Michael</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.629" end="00:01:02.809" style="s2">Moore presents planet of the humans full</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">documentary what&#39;s the guy&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.809" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">directed by Jeff Gibbs so basically I</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:12.330" style="s2">can save you two hours in the entire</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:15.170" style="s2">documentary is that the green industries</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">in a green industry that every solar</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.170" end="00:01:21.060" style="s2">farm every wind farm is basically still</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">run on fossil fuels and quite frankly</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.060" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">the same people who run the fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">are running the new projects there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:29.310" style="s2">new infrastructure projects and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">basically you know screwing over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:33.049" style="s2">environment in order to put them in and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">not getting electricity out of them any</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.049" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">alternative energy is intermittent that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2">you can&#39;t run a city on purely solar or</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:44.060" style="s2">wind because there&#39;s you can&#39;t guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">solar wind so you need a backup system</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.060" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">to and if the backup system is there it</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">can&#39;t just up and down regulate because</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">that costs a lot of energy for like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">coal processing plant and such so and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">then basically they just they were like</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">humans were the cause of everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.310" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">which they seemed to think was an</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like I think that&#39;s pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">established that humans are the cause</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">but it&#39;s not co2 fault it&#39;s human&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">fault I&#39;d like to be where we ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:13.640" style="s2">actually blaming the molecule the reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s there is because of humans</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.640" end="00:02:22.290" style="s2">but that piece that our focus on what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:27.210" style="s2">a solution has shifted to green energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.290" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">and the green New Deal and yet how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.210" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">have a green new deal or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">that when there isn&#39;t technology there</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">yet it&#39;s Al Gore puts out a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">and then he gets all of his money from</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.040" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">all these the same corporations that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:47.430" style="s2">he&#39;s working against and the Sierra Club</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:49.590" style="s2">whose environmental organizations</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.430" end="00:02:52.050" style="s2">getting all the money from from the oil</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.590" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">and energy companies and so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.050" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">basically the same old single game one</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">game a they&#39;re playing game a they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:02.190" style="s2">trying to green wash it but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:05.300" style="s2">playing gave me and yeah like everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.190" end="00:03:09.950" style="s2">that is wrong with our society there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.300" end="00:03:14.820" style="s2">few fundamental things that fix it our</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.950" end="00:03:17.459" style="s2">ignorance to what is going on even those</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.820" end="00:03:19.860" style="s2">of us who don&#39;t want to be ignorant and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.459" end="00:03:22.739" style="s2">constantly seek out new information and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.860" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">what&#39;s going on even if we have perfect</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.739" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">knowledge right even if we actually know</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">what&#39;s going on it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:33.060" style="s2">matter because the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:36.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t we&#39;re seeing now that even if</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.060" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">you are a doctor a microbiologist even</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.450" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">if you understand Co mid-nineteen the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:43.100" style="s2">fact that other people don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">it but that other people don&#39;t trust the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.100" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">the systems that are supposed to inform</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:50.489" style="s2">us and instruct us and govern us on</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:53.550" style="s2">things that are that are this big that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.489" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">we don&#39;t trust them costs all of us that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.550" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">they can tap into our ignorant and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:03.690" style="s2">complexity of our world and just push</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:05.610" style="s2">things through without us without us</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.690" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">knowing that like well it&#39;s solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.610" end="00:04:10.620" style="s2">of course it&#39;s of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:13.290" style="s2">environmentally friendly no no like how</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.620" end="00:04:15.239" style="s2">did the solar panels mean how how much</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.290" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">energy goes into it how much water goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.239" end="00:04:19.310" style="s2">into it how much life do you get out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">it I mean that the soul this the wind</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.310" end="00:04:28.380" style="s2">farms even if they were efficient aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">are there for 20 years well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.380" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">sustainable because the amount of metal</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:36.750" style="s2">that goes into them and then what do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:44.030" style="s2">do with it we&#39;re not designing them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">be durable to last a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.030" end="00:04:49.050" style="s2">luckily we&#39;re gonna do a solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:52.340" style="s2">raising in two weeks two weeks faster</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.050" end="00:04:55.639" style="s2">days so I think it&#39;s like May 6 on</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.340" end="00:04:57.690" style="s2">energy how do we get energy as here as</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.639" end="00:05:00.360" style="s2">watching Elsa&#39;s documentary they had one</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.690" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">point where they had a American town</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.360" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">that had had all of their their jobs</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">leave during that I think that they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">talking with the 2008 financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:08.610" style="s2">what they might&#39;ve been talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:13.590" style="s2">previous one of course manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.610" end="00:05:16.860" style="s2">jobs all left and they have put in I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.590" end="00:05:19.410" style="s2">think they&#39;re it was a wind farm and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.860" end="00:05:23.690" style="s2">they they had all of these jobs for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.410" end="00:05:26.490" style="s2">very small period of time and this is I</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.690" end="00:05:29.340" style="s2">look at any project and that is what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.490" end="00:05:31.830" style="s2">see I&#39;m like how can you sell your soul</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.340" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">to the devil for a thousand temporary</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.830" end="00:05:36.660" style="s2">jobs do the government&#39;s not know</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:38.070" style="s2">they&#39;re temporary like the regular</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.660" end="00:05:39.539" style="s2">everyday people I get it you just want a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.070" end="00:05:40.979" style="s2">job so you just want to get hired there</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.539" end="00:05:44.100" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s not permanent</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.979" end="00:05:48.180" style="s2">right like once this thing has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.100" end="00:05:50.039" style="s2">built if unless maintenance of it costs</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" end="00:05:51.870" style="s2">it needs you need a physical human being</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.039" end="00:05:53.130" style="s2">to maintain it and then how many do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.870" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">mean so that you don&#39;t have let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.130" end="00:05:56.220" style="s2">they have hundreds of people employed</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.740" style="s2">now they have three people employed but</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.220" end="00:06:01.850" style="s2">watching this small town yeah if it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.740" end="00:06:03.960" style="s2">a city watching a small city big town</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.850" end="00:06:05.220" style="s2">talk about right they had jobs now they</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.960" end="00:06:07.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have jobs and didn&#39;t have jobs</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.220" end="00:06:09.030" style="s2">this wood fire became they get made jobs</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.200" end="00:06:10.650" style="s2">they were temporary and now they have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.030" end="00:06:13.110" style="s2">deal with wind burns if we&#39;re biofuels</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.650" end="00:06:14.430" style="s2">like a whole big huge issue because</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.110" end="00:06:17.580" style="s2">they&#39;re like basically cutting down</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.430" end="00:06:19.410" style="s2">trees in order to loan to fuel it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.580" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not efficient</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.410" end="00:06:24.180" style="s2">that&#39;s not environmentally friendly that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:27.320" style="s2">does not make sense in anything but game</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.180" end="00:06:30.360" style="s2">a profitability and greenwashing things</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.320" end="00:06:31.860" style="s2">but having in with a small town there</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.360" end="00:06:33.720" style="s2">was this like moment of clarity where I</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.860" end="00:06:35.370" style="s2">was like like why doesn&#39;t this small</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.720" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">town and it&#39;s what I feel but basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.370" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">anything and everything get together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">figure it out for themselves</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.050" end="00:07:33.240" style="s2">up our world is we need solutions we</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.569" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">need to actually create great so if</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.629" end="00:07:50.039" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist in game a it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.180" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">in our current infrastructure but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.039" end="00:07:55.110" style="s2">game a like that you have to lie that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:58.529" style="s2">you have to fudge the data that you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.110" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">to mark it in a way that isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.529" end="00:08:05.639" style="s2">instead of okay it if I owned a solar</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:06.930" style="s2">panel company I can&#39;t even look at all</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.639" end="00:08:08.430" style="s2">of the energy and water that went into</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.930" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2">the solar panel I have to just look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.430" end="00:08:12.060" style="s2">the solar panel in order to sell it</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">right in order to say hey you get this</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.060" end="00:08:15.900" style="s2">many gigawatt hours out of it right but</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:17.400" style="s2">how many gigawatt hours went into</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.900" end="00:08:21.300" style="s2">producing it don&#39;t ask that question</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.400" end="00:08:24.389" style="s2">looking just here if it&#39;s our company if</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.300" end="00:08:27.469" style="s2">we want actual electricity for the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.389" end="00:08:30.509" style="s2">efficient environmentally friendly way</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.469" end="00:08:32.310" style="s2">then there are certain problems that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.509" end="00:08:36.089" style="s2">need to get solved mainly the storage of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.310" end="00:08:39.180" style="s2">the energy which is batteries which</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.089" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">supposedly one company owns the patent</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.180" end="00:08:43.349" style="s2">though even Tesla has to buy batteries</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:48.110" style="s2">and put them together it&#39;s a Panasonic</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.349" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">that owns it or something but together</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.110" end="00:08:51.940" style="s2">both we</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:55.900" style="s2">and break the patent system in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.940" end="00:08:57.550" style="s2">ethical way because we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.900" end="00:09:00.850" style="s2">have the capacity to follow it just like</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.550" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">under Co bid 19 the state home orders or</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.850" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">there&#39;s now companies you&#39;re like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">gonna sue you you&#39;re printing your 3d</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:07.960" style="s2">printing things for the respirators that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:11.230" style="s2">are our our intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.960" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">good luck suing after this you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.230" end="00:09:15.700" style="s2">sue something that saved people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:19.390" style="s2">they were in an emergencies the laws are</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.700" end="00:09:22.510" style="s2">bendable we&#39;re also in a much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.390" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">emergency that is the climate crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.510" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">that is the environmental degradation</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:31.420" style="s2">that is the massive disparity between</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:32.890" style="s2">the rich and the poor and so yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.420" end="00:09:35.350" style="s2">together we can break the patents the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.890" end="00:09:36.580" style="s2">patents so that any ingenuity is all our</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.350" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">ingenuity it doesn&#39;t even need to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.580" end="00:09:44.770" style="s2">done in a way that&#39;s illegal like we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:46.600" style="s2">when you have enough people like they do</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.770" end="00:09:50.100" style="s2">it all the time right the big couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.600" end="00:09:52.840" style="s2">corporations that own the patents and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.100" end="00:09:54.970" style="s2">our own most of the patents then they</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.840" end="00:09:56.950" style="s2">find a patent they don&#39;t own if they</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.970" end="00:09:58.810" style="s2">can&#39;t buy it first cheap as they want it</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.950" end="00:10:00.400" style="s2">they will break that pocket they will</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.810" end="00:10:04.780" style="s2">just make it and be like you sue us go</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.400" end="00:10:07.510" style="s2">ahead try we got lots of lawyers what do</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.780" end="00:10:09.100" style="s2">you got you you didn&#39;t have a profitable</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.510" end="00:10:12.610" style="s2">business you just had an idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.100" end="00:10:18.090" style="s2">patented we&#39;re the we&#39;re the big boys we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.610" end="00:10:20.350" style="s2">have the power we have and so it&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.090" end="00:10:21.580" style="s2">so the corporation&#39;s don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.350" end="00:10:23.590" style="s2">to follow patent law it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.580" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">little guys that I&#39;m with and they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.590" end="00:10:26.350" style="s2">to of course fall between each other the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:28.840" style="s2">big guys can&#39;t take patents from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.350" end="00:10:33.850" style="s2">other big guys but and I&#39;m using guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.840" end="00:10:39.250" style="s2">purposely it&#39;s named Glenn having the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.850" end="00:10:41.380" style="s2">system that we together keep great</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.250" end="00:10:43.570" style="s2">things and that unveils the point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.380" end="00:10:46.990" style="s2">this with with them especially renewable</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.570" end="00:10:50.410" style="s2">energy is that I have an assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.990" end="00:10:52.420" style="s2">every problem is already been solved by</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.410" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">somebody alone in their house it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.420" end="00:10:59.410" style="s2">really hard to get an idea to market so</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:11:01.150" style="s2">somebody knows how to store batteries</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.410" end="00:11:02.950" style="s2">they understand batteries yes they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.150" end="00:11:03.730" style="s2">do it because of patents but they know</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.950" end="00:11:05.859" style="s2">batteries</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.730" end="00:11:08.980" style="s2">there&#39;s people who who have</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.859" end="00:11:10.929" style="s2">next-generation wind and solar but they</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.980" end="00:11:12.669" style="s2">have to compete with like bp&#39;s division</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.929" end="00:11:13.929" style="s2">of wind and solar and there are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.669" end="00:11:15.100" style="s2">that have the politicians ears those</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.929" end="00:11:17.470" style="s2">other ones have the regulators so they</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.100" end="00:11:19.089" style="s2">don&#39;t just because you have a better</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.470" end="00:11:20.649" style="s2">material just because you have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.089" end="00:11:24.850" style="s2">better way to create energy doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.649" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">it&#39;s out there doesn&#39;t just mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.850" end="00:11:29.049" style="s2">easy to get it out there like well if it</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:31.389" style="s2">if it&#39;s a better mousetrap it&#39;ll be easy</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.049" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">to market it no no because all the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.389" end="00:11:44.049" style="s2">trap companies aren&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:49.119" style="s2">fighting against you but together we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.049" end="00:11:51.459" style="s2">we can go to youtube go to youtube um on</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.689" end="00:12:16.629" style="s2">alternative solutions right but like if</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.739" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">we don&#39;t prop those up if we don&#39;t help</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.289" end="00:12:45.419" style="s2">human waste for biofuel like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.389" end="00:12:49.689" style="s2">use the actual byproducts of living</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.419" end="00:12:50.829" style="s2">instead of creep like Oh biofuel sounds</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.740" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">governments cuz guarantee they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.970" end="00:14:59.080" style="s2">give it the projects to their buddies</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:01.720" style="s2">who have no intention of creating good</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.200" end="00:15:08.650" style="s2">now they like the big corporations are</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:09.940" style="s2">getting the bailouts and then the ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.650" end="00:15:14.920" style="s2">that it was actually designed for art</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.940" end="00:15:16.090" style="s2">and so if we created together there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.920" end="00:15:17.830" style="s2">few things we can do we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.090" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">system of information that we trust a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.830" end="00:15:23.410" style="s2">system of information on corporations</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:25.780" style="s2">and on technology it like innovation</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.410" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">that&#39;s not technology innovation of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.780" end="00:15:29.560" style="s2">okay is this actually innovative cuz</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:30.100" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna tell me it is when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.560" end="00:15:31.779" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.100" end="00:15:33.100" style="s2">and you&#39;re profiting off of it and quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.779" end="00:15:36.610" style="s2">frankly you&#39;re not you be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.100" end="00:15:38.470" style="s2">when it&#39;s not innovative so being able</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.610" end="00:15:42.009" style="s2">to design a system that can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.470" end="00:15:44.550" style="s2">more neutral and say what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.009" end="00:15:46.600" style="s2">form of energy that Vancouver can use</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.550" end="00:15:50.050" style="s2">because then there&#39;s this this other</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.600" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">side that&#39;s like well our energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.050" end="00:15:54.310" style="s2">consumption goes up and up as</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:56.769" style="s2">individuals and yet we want our</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.310" end="00:16:00.519" style="s2">governments to be able to create perfect</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.769" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">solutions and they create anything but</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.519" end="00:16:07.449" style="s2">perfect solutions like in BC in</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">Vancouver do we have enough energy for</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.449" end="00:16:12.009" style="s2">for our population yeah I think the math</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">shows that we do we do in fact have</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.009" end="00:16:16.779" style="s2">enough energy for our population they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:18.639" style="s2">also creating the sight see down why so</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.779" end="00:16:20.019" style="s2">that other corporations can come in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.639" end="00:16:22.269" style="s2">have more electricity for less and less</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.019" end="00:16:24.190" style="s2">money it&#39;s not for the population and if</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.269" end="00:16:26.380" style="s2">we had that information transparently</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.190" end="00:16:31.089" style="s2">available we wouldn&#39;t be led in sight</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.380" end="00:16:32.829" style="s2">CDF go through and but you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.089" end="00:16:33.579" style="s2">right if we did actually need that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.829" end="00:16:34.990" style="s2">electricity</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.579" end="00:16:36.189" style="s2">okay government we need electricity I</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.990" end="00:16:37.990" style="s2">need it to be cheap I need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.189" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">afford it I need to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.990" end="00:16:43.089" style="s2">plentiful and you know a are you allowed</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:45.250" style="s2">to flood the flood of river valleys so</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.089" end="00:16:46.360" style="s2">we can have a new down you need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.250" end="00:16:48.579" style="s2">figure out how to get us electricity</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.360" end="00:16:50.439" style="s2">without that together we could figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.579" end="00:16:53.439" style="s2">that out but the government can&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.439" end="00:16:55.720" style="s2">that out they cannot create social</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.439" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">safety nets environmental policies make</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.720" end="00:17:00.069" style="s2">everybody happy and not raise taxes</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:01.269" style="s2">which is what we kind of want them to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.069" end="00:17:03.639" style="s2">right we want them to have this like</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.269" end="00:17:05.530" style="s2">perfect solution like he uses no more</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.639" end="00:17:06.970" style="s2">money and it makes everybody happy</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.530" end="00:17:08.409" style="s2">at least we want them to make me happy</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.970" end="00:17:10.179" style="s2">forget about everyone else make me happy</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.409" end="00:17:13.720" style="s2">whole way to make me happier to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.179" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">other people miserable we together can</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.720" end="00:17:20.140" style="s2">figure out things like electricity</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:25.419" style="s2">plumbing water food food especially food</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.140" end="00:17:28.089" style="s2">we can figure out and if we have food it</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.419" end="00:17:30.220" style="s2">both destroys our economy and helps it</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.089" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">yes it destroys it in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.220" end="00:17:35.110" style="s2">copa90 knows where things dude start to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:37.390" style="s2">break down when you take the profit out</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.110" end="00:17:40.030" style="s2">of it our entire gaming system is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.390" end="00:17:42.429" style="s2">designed on corruption and profit and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.030" end="00:17:43.570" style="s2">like that it needs to flow and it needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.429" end="00:17:44.860" style="s2">to keep flowing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.570" end="00:17:46.179" style="s2">keep destroying the environment in order</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.860" end="00:17:47.470" style="s2">for us to keep pretending that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.179" end="00:17:49.779" style="s2">economy is a real thing that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.470" end="00:17:51.610" style="s2">keep going like our lives depend on it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.779" end="00:17:54.340" style="s2">for real and they don&#39;t depend on it for</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.340" end="00:17:59.190" style="s2">economy inner because of the economy if</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.429" end="00:18:01.210" style="s2">we have real food getting to real people</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.190" end="00:18:03.460" style="s2">we don&#39;t need the food supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.210" end="00:18:04.990" style="s2">right that exists as it currently is and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.460" end="00:18:05.470" style="s2">has all the waste and all of that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.990" end="00:18:10.360" style="s2">crap</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.470" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">but if we all of a sudden fed everyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.360" end="00:18:15.970" style="s2">tomorrow people aren&#39;t as desperate and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:17.409" style="s2">they don&#39;t need to go to work and if</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.570" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">you cannot pay them next to nothing</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:28.269" style="s2">the sake of profit and that breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.259" end="00:18:29.919" style="s2">our economy but it breaks it down at</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.269" end="00:18:36.600" style="s2">least in solitary way to solid there</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.919" end="00:18:41.679" style="s2">anyways we&#39;re like wheat like fed people</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.600" end="00:18:45.610" style="s2">who are looking for purpose can fix all</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.679" end="00:18:48.730" style="s2">of our issues together the key is to not</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.610" end="00:18:51.700" style="s2">focus on controlling other people but on</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.730" end="00:18:54.370" style="s2">helping other people when no solution</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.620" end="00:19:00.730" style="s2">right you can&#39;t we&#39;re not making like</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.429" end="00:19:19.269" style="s2">figure out how we grow food together</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.889" end="00:19:21.700" style="s2">what does that infrastructure look like</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.269" end="00:19:25.059" style="s2">Vancouver can grow enough food for our</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.700" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">citizens if we start right like if we</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.450" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">I&#39;m like oh we can do solution raisings</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.100" end="00:33:26.870" style="s2">with it we can actually create that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:28.820" style="s2">be the bed that did you believe which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.870" end="00:33:31.100" style="s2">a little confusing it&#39;s it&#39;s not my it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.820" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">the idea that when enough people sign up</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.100" end="00:33:33.950" style="s2">for something it tips it over and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">that&#39;s when you take action so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.950" end="00:33:37.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a moratorium on rent</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:39.110" style="s2">right right what&#39;s what&#39;s going on if</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.670" end="00:33:41.180" style="s2">they&#39;re the only one not paying rent you</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.110" end="00:33:43.420" style="s2">can get evicted except the lovable you</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.180" end="00:33:46.070" style="s2">can get evicted if nobody&#39;s paying rent</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.420" end="00:33:47.450" style="s2">no they can&#39;t evict everyone right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.070" end="00:33:48.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a tipping point where you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.450" end="00:33:51.020" style="s2">taking the action until you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.920" end="00:33:54.260" style="s2">enough people taking the action that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.020" end="00:33:57.610" style="s2">that it is no longer as risky that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.260" end="00:34:00.800" style="s2">what Jubilee has become synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.610" end="00:34:01.850" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one time - Jubilee it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.800" end="00:34:07.250" style="s2">little confusing wouldn&#39;t you believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.850" end="00:34:09.409" style="s2">talks about it you believe but creating</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.250" end="00:34:11.300" style="s2">solutions together creating something</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.409" end="00:34:15.230" style="s2">that 10,000 people could participate in</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.300" end="00:34:19.490" style="s2">in whatever depth they want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.230" end="00:34:21.530" style="s2">participate in it in so 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.490" end="00:34:25.460" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to be on a board of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.530" end="00:34:26.929" style="s2">directors working 40 hours a week please</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.460" end="00:34:28.580" style="s2">nobody on the Board of Directors review</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.929" end="00:34:30.880" style="s2">for a week or I won&#39;t be able to be on</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.580" end="00:34:33.260" style="s2">the board of directors but having a</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.880" end="00:34:35.929" style="s2">10,000 people putting in ten dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.260" end="00:34:38.870" style="s2">month or ten dollars total to say yes we</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.929" end="00:34:40.550" style="s2">want we want a solution to education I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.870" end="00:34:42.710" style="s2">willing to put ten dollars into a pool</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.550" end="00:34:46.550" style="s2">to come up with a way to move education</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.710" end="00:34:47.870" style="s2">forward even if I know because out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.550" end="00:34:48.919" style="s2">the ten thousand people creating and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.870" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s never gonna be a perfect solution</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.919" end="00:34:51.770" style="s2">for all of them it&#39;s not about creating</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:53.060" style="s2">the perfect solution it&#39;s about creating</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.770" end="00:34:55.490" style="s2">a solution that works for enough people</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.060" end="00:34:57.950" style="s2">enough at the time and then continually</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.490" end="00:35:00.650" style="s2">improving it so that it works for more</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.950" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">and more people at a deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.650" end="00:35:05.900" style="s2">better and better level so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:08.360" style="s2">start with an education system because</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.900" end="00:35:12.650" style="s2">we had the education solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.360" end="00:35:13.670" style="s2">before the lockdown and we created so</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.650" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty cool but it was like well</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.670" end="00:35:17.180" style="s2">yeah but we&#39;re not gonna we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:18.950" style="s2">like my kids deletes doing school I</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.180" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">still think child cares know some child</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.950" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2">cares god you&#39;re like oh actually it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">little more feasible than normal but so</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.150" end="00:35:28.410" style="s2">our idea for 10,000 people $100,000 was</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">basically like an after-school right my</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.410" end="00:35:32.069" style="s2">like how can I get my kid to learn what</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:34.530" style="s2">she needs to learn in with stuff she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.069" end="00:35:36.390" style="s2">interested in in her learning style how</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.530" end="00:35:38.309" style="s2">do we have a lifelong learning and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.390" end="00:35:41.490" style="s2">it&#39;s just really about like curating</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.309" end="00:35:43.260" style="s2">Missouri out there we can do that with</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.490" end="00:35:45.240" style="s2">with two thousand people one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.260" end="00:35:47.369" style="s2">thousand dollars it&#39;s about what does</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.240" end="00:35:48.539" style="s2">your family need what does your kid need</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.369" end="00:35:49.799" style="s2">right maybe we don&#39;t start with ten</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.539" end="00:35:51.809" style="s2">thousand people maybe we start with ten</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.799" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">thousand people with kids that are in</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.809" end="00:35:54.990" style="s2">elementary school or ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:56.819" style="s2">that don&#39;t have kids and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.990" end="00:35:58.980" style="s2">lifelong learning great it&#39;s about adult</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.819" end="00:36:02.039" style="s2">learning learning when you&#39;re a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.980" end="00:36:04.319" style="s2">what do you want to learn any problem we</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.039" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">can create a solution for it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.319" end="00:36:08.130" style="s2">be way better than what a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:11.010" style="s2">company can do because even if they</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.130" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">created the exact same thing five people</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.010" end="00:36:14.369" style="s2">sitting around being like oh we could</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:15.630" style="s2">totally Orkut we could curate the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.369" end="00:36:18.329" style="s2">information that&#39;s already out there</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.630" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">make a money or a non-profit they decide</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.329" end="00:36:21.930" style="s2">they want to create a non-profit or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:23.910" style="s2">goodness of their heart and work they we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.930" end="00:36:25.260" style="s2">could do this everyone has education did</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.910" end="00:36:27.000" style="s2">enough to prove they&#39;re there for other</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.260" end="00:36:28.200" style="s2">the goodness of their own heart prove</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.000" end="00:36:30.180" style="s2">they&#39;re not there for the various</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.200" end="00:36:33.299" style="s2">reasons as opposed to if we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.180" end="00:36:34.829" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter whether we&#39;re the ten</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.299" end="00:36:38.039" style="s2">thousand as long as we&#39;re willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.829" end="00:36:40.200" style="s2">transparent to the ten thousand which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.039" end="00:36:43.529" style="s2">part of the deal you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.200" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">so ten thousand people what is a process</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.529" end="00:36:46.260" style="s2">ten thousand people can be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:48.420" style="s2">without meeting ten thousand people to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.260" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">be at the board table right ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.420" end="00:36:54.569" style="s2">people are funding it so they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">allowed and able to participate at</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.569" end="00:37:01.710" style="s2">whatever level they want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:03.869" style="s2">at so ways for them to volunteer varies</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.710" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">for them to stay informed that are easy</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.869" end="00:37:08.970" style="s2">and simple and if those things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:12.119" style="s2">working improving those two right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.970" end="00:37:13.140" style="s2">improving the method of creation of how</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.119" end="00:37:18.020" style="s2">do we create a solution with ten</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.140" end="00:37:21.990" style="s2">thousand people and we&#39;re improving the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.020" end="00:37:25.230" style="s2">projects themselves once we have one how</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.990" end="00:37:28.619" style="s2">do we create the beta and constantly</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.230" end="00:37:31.890" style="s2">improve it there&#39;s going to be a group</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.619" end="00:37:34.859" style="s2">of people that are employed to create</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.890" end="00:37:38.520" style="s2">and run that tech project right but</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.859" end="00:37:40.410" style="s2">instead of the current system where</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.520" end="00:37:42.060" style="s2">again a tiny group of people has to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.410" end="00:37:43.530" style="s2">up with an idea that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.060" end="00:37:47.430" style="s2">to be sold to the masses and they have</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.530" end="00:37:49.170" style="s2">to be able to make it purposeful enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.430" end="00:37:50.430" style="s2">that they can profit off of it enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.170" end="00:37:52.530" style="s2">that they can stay in business in order</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.430" end="00:37:54.020" style="s2">to actually do anything in their purpose</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.530" end="00:37:58.710" style="s2">right so someone comes up with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.020" end="00:38:00.660" style="s2">team-building app that helps you with</p>

<p begin="00:41:22.109" end="00:41:25.650" style="s2">the point that like the only way Google</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.089" end="00:41:28.619" style="s2">and Facebook could actually out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.650" end="00:41:32.099" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do is by them becoming</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.619" end="00:41:34.799" style="s2">us which we still win right if Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.099" end="00:41:37.020" style="s2">actually became a collectively</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.020" end="00:41:40.829" style="s2">could decide what&#39;s done with it</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:42.569" style="s2">we all would couldn&#39;t crowdsource</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.569" end="00:41:48.059" style="s2">problems and the security issues and see</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.349" end="00:41:51.150" style="s2">transparently why we&#39;re choosing to use</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.059" end="00:41:53.849" style="s2">it then they became us that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.150" end="00:41:55.349" style="s2">way they can out-compete us so instead</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.849" end="00:41:57.329" style="s2">of us recreating them they basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.349" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">just gave themselves to humanity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.329" end="00:42:02.339" style="s2">that&#39;s a win like it&#39;s like they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:04.260" style="s2">actually market us out of existence not</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.339" end="00:42:06.359" style="s2">in the beginning they could once you</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.260" end="00:42:09.140" style="s2">have enough people in the process itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.359" end="00:42:11.870" style="s2">is enjoyable if</p>

<p begin="00:58:02.589" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">and less and less we can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.380" end="00:58:10.000" style="s2">actual system wealth we raise the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:11.470" style="s2">actual rate of our employees by five</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:13.930" style="s2">dollars an hour we would bankrupt</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.470" end="00:58:15.880" style="s2">ourselves let&#39;s do that let&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.930" end="00:58:19.000" style="s2">bankrupt ourselves but how can we give</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.880" end="00:58:22.030" style="s2">the equivalent value of five dollars an</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.000" end="00:58:24.130" style="s2">hour to our employees without actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.030" end="00:58:28.660" style="s2">having to hand over $5 an hour to each</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.130" end="00:58:31.480" style="s2">and every one of them more an hour to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.660" end="00:58:33.609" style="s2">$25 an hour right there are 20 we had to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.480" end="00:58:36.190" style="s2">bring them up to $25 an hour so our</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.609" end="00:58:39.570" style="s2">workforce could could afford the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.190" end="00:58:42.910" style="s2">standard of living at was a living wage</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.570" end="00:58:46.270" style="s2">well to pay each of them five more</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.910" end="00:58:50.140" style="s2">dollars an hour is expensive to bring</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.270" end="00:58:52.780" style="s2">down the cost of living by $5 per hour</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.140" end="00:58:53.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just benefit our employees and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.780" end="00:58:56.560" style="s2">benefits everyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.770" end="00:58:57.880" style="s2">and so if weird trance we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.560" end="00:58:59.260" style="s2">enough workforce we&#39;re gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.880" end="00:59:02.800" style="s2">increase our age we&#39;re gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.260" end="00:59:05.800" style="s2">compete if everyone is able to eat and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.800" end="00:59:07.390" style="s2">live and educate and be educated and</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.800" end="00:59:09.580" style="s2">have energy and have all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.390" end="00:59:12.040" style="s2">are that make life worth living and</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.580" end="00:59:15.730" style="s2">abundance and beautiful and they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.040" end="00:59:17.800" style="s2">to have that at $25 an hour and we bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.730" end="00:59:18.790" style="s2">that cost of living down to 20 our</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.800" end="00:59:21.160" style="s2">dollars an hour</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.790" end="00:59:22.300" style="s2">times 40 hours a week times 52 weeks a</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.160" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">year right that&#39;s how much it costs to</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.300" end="00:59:26.849" style="s2">live then we&#39;re bringing it down for</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">everyone and we can bring it down our</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.849" end="00:59:31.930" style="s2">society our economic system our</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:33.760" style="s2">government system is designed to inflate</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.930" end="00:59:35.980" style="s2">and inflate and inflate and we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.760" end="00:59:39.430" style="s2">inflation we can design a system that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.980" end="00:59:41.130" style="s2">deflates we can design it it costs forty</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.430" end="00:59:42.880" style="s2">thousand dollars a link to live at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.130" end="00:59:45.099" style="s2">standard of living you&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:46.630" style="s2">living at we can bring that down further</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.099" end="00:59:47.250" style="s2">and further so now it cost thirty-eight</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.630" end="00:59:50.530" style="s2">thousand</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.250" end="00:59:53.349" style="s2">35000 cost 30,000 instead of meaning to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.530" end="00:59:55.089" style="s2">pay everybody that amount of money we</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.349" end="00:59:56.500" style="s2">and again it doesn&#39;t just benefit our</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.089" end="00:59:59.020" style="s2">employees and benefits everyone</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.500" end="01:00:01.869" style="s2">right if what it costs you to feed your</p>
