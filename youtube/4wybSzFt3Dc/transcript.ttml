<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">leave as much as possible for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">um so i just want to complete two things</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">i want to talk about sense making at</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">and i want to do that in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:13.599" style="s2">different types of data</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">and i want to finish that off with some</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.599" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">speculation about reversing ashby&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">and the importance of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">so people from an information science</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">background will know what i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">about and anybody else i&#39;ll explain it</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">when i get to that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like the plan yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">so if i can share my screen</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">gaping void call them illustrations yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">i quite like the cartoon world</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know gaping void it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">going onto the website you get regular</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">mailers</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">um they&#39;re very into something called</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">semiotics</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">and that&#39;s something we&#39;re about to run</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">a major retreat on if you check on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the road of semiotics</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">and aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">in sense making that&#39;s a participative</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">retreat</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">um and we know from a whole body work</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">i&#39;ve already mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">that art is fundamental to human sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">art comes before language in human</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">it turns out the abstraction of art</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">allows us to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">novel and unusual connections between</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">things and that appears to be its</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">evolutionary advantage</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">and within the context of that we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">the role of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">now this is where i kind of like got</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">started in complexity theory many years</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:58.840" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">i was working in knowledge management</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">and this was in ibm&#39;s institute for</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">knowledge management it was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">the then hot um</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">hot thing and i was taking a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">contradictory perspective which is by</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">now you realize it&#39;s very unusual for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">i was arguing against nanaka now if</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">anybody hasn&#39;t come across nanaka</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">he&#39;s a management guru from japan he</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">created a thing called the seki</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">socialization externalization</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">combination internalization</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">and basically what he was saying is you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">could make tacit knowledge explicit</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">and i and many others said you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">and i adapted a phrase of pilani which</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">is we always know more than we can stay</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">and added to that we will always say</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">more than we can write down</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">so that started myself with brasso and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">into the concept that there&#39;s knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">um low abstraction low codification</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">which is kind of like the example i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">used for that is a london</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">taxi driver in this lecture before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">deep knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">acquired over time through experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">in the other extreme you have the map</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">and i was using maps most of the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">week in the lake</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">district maps have conventions they have</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">symbology they&#39;re highly codified</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">they&#39;re highly abstract if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">understand you can use them</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:23.919" style="s2">um but when i got stuck in the deep mist</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">on high cap nick i was really grateful</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.919" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">i&#39;d been there before</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">i had experience as well it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">like a native guide in the map</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">two very different people but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">which links the two together is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">so if somebody with deep expertise wants</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">to explain what they&#39;re doing and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">see this in apprentice models</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">they tend to tell stories good lecturers</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">tell stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s much easier to understand text if</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">somebody tells stories about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">so narrative is a transition between</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">high codification high abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">and low codification low abstraction the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">expert tells stories once you get enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:04.479" style="s2">stories the stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">can be written down they can be codified</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.479" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">that it can be distributed</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">if when you&#39;re reading a document you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">can hear the stories it has more meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">and as you acquire sufficient stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">and experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:18.840" style="s2">effectively build tacit knowledge into</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">the system so that was kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.840" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">and i still stand by that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">work i did with the us army was focused</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">on what&#39;s called narrative enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">so if you actually link um codified</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:33.199" style="s2">knowledge in the form of doctrine into</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">multiple</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.199" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">anecdotal data items you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">see your sense patterns and the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">codification goes down significantly</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">so narrative is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">narrative is also more important if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">look at the current political situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">and i want to make a few statements here</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">because this is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">general to organizational change as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">as the politics</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">one of the associations we&#39;ve made is</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">between what is called a trope in</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">narrative theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">a strange attractor in complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">and an assemblage</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">if you move into delusion epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to run</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.800" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">through those three so</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">one of the things i hate hate and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">sorry you&#39;ve had susan blackmore and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:21.639" style="s2">a major confrontation with her in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">hay festival on this and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.639" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">non-nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">she talks about free will i intensely</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">dislike the concept of memes</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s actually really bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.759" style="s2">um it was developed by dawkins and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">basic concept is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.759" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">i mean the selfish gene is an appalling</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">book anyway marilyn mitchell and others</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">you know extensively demolished it the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">concept that there&#39;s something which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">a unit which you seek into its replicate</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">is like going back to the pre-socratic</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know a single geneticist who</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">dawkins theory talking seriously because</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">the gene is not the primary unit</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">and that ignores epigenetics if nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">and the same is problem with the meme</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a single story which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">seeking to replicate itself</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">what you actually have are multiple</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">anecdotes which are clustering around</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">the theme</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">so in complexity terms they form a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">strange attractor</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you&#39;ve got something which</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">is seeking to infect and replicate</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">magmatic concept what you&#39;ve got is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">body of narrative that you can&#39;t escape</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve been sucked into it and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">very different way of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">uh so this is what the lewis calls as an</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">assemblage</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">in that i tell a story you tell a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">similar story we like telling stories to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">each other gradually</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">as those stories start to cluster and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">form a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:50.519" style="s2">um this narrative or the assemblage</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.519" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">independently of the storytellers</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">and you can see that with for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">some of the narrative structures around</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">around trump and various other things</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">what you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">is an attractor and if you know about</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">strange attractors in complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">you know the lorenz butterflies the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">famous example nothing ever follows the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">same pattern but there is a pattern in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">the overall sense of movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you see in this so a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">trope and assemblage of strange</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">detractor</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">is a pattern of narrative which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.880" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">controlling the way that people think</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s not simply a matter of changing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">one narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">to change that you&#39;ve actually got to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">change the attractor well or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">attractor pattern</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">and this is important all right so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">terms of changing attractors there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">various things you can do you can change</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">you can create adjacent attractors</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">and one of the big things that we talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">about is that if you have a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">negative narrative pattern a negative</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">trope</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">arguing against it directly makes it</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">worse not better</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">what you have to do is to create an</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">adjacent attractor which can suck energy</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">away from it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:06.079" style="s2">and then gradually shift the system in</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">the right direction so i want to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.079" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">little bit about how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">and then come into some conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">remarks so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">i think i did this one last time okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">could somebody just confirm i did show</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">this last week yeah that&#39;s cool okay so</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">remember the concept here is is big data</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">algorithmically interpreted contrasted</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">with thick data which is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">ethnographer</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">our work focuses on what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">self-ethnography or distributed</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:38.920" style="s2">ethnography</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">so we transfer the power of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.920" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">interpretation to the research subject</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">and so the research subject places their</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">narrative into a quantitative framework</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">now the best example i&#39;ve got of that or</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:53.680" style="s2">the one i normally give it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">the best but it&#39;s what i normally use</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.680" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">is at some stage in your lives you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">all done an employee satisfaction survey</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">everybody done a satisfaction survey of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">some type</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:05.519" style="s2">and we got one of these when i was in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">ibm</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">and it basically said one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">questions was does your manager consult</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">on a regular basis scale of 0 not at</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">all 10 all the time that&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">typical right it&#39;s called a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">based</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">question so the hypothesis is yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">you can see what it is they assume that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">managers consulting you is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">so they want more of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">so i found that hr and i was delayed in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">the uk i had to wait to talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">in the u.s i</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">realized then i was on a watch list i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">actually run a six-month program which</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">had experimentally proved that astrology</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">was more accurate than myers-briggs in</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">predicting team behavior and hr hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">quite forgiven me for that yet so it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">um i was a marked person</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a good experiment actually i</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">recommend running it whenever you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">astrology at least doesn&#39;t claim to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">um so i got to this woman and i said</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">okay so how am i meant to answer this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">because i&#39;ve got several managers</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">and sometimes they consult me and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">sometimes they don&#39;t and sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">should and sometimes they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">you&#39;re asking a context-specific</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:18.120" style="s2">question in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">a context-free question in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.120" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">context-specific world and remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the key things about</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:23.760" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">context specificity as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.760" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">context-free</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure she understood me but she</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">said average your experience over the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">year and stopped causing trouble and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">slapped the phone down on me</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">which meant she didn&#39;t hear what i said</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">about her being a hr person in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">research department</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:42.360" style="s2">and having that attitude we take a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">different approach we&#39;ll ask a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.360" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">non-hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">question so one for example we use there</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">is what story would you tell your best</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">friend if they would offer a job in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">work group</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:58.880" style="s2">yeah this is highly context specific and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">then we ask people to self-interpret</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.880" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">that question yeah the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">question so they&#39;re interpreting the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">contextual</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">answer to a open non-hypothesis question</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">and they do that for example into six</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">triangles took a long time to make it</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">one of the triangles will say in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">the manager&#39;s behavior was altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">assertive</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">analytical three balanced positive</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">now what that actually does and one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">the advantages of having a visiting</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">chair in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">psychology department is i can use</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">first-year students as experimental</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">subjects</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">and wire them up right they have to sign</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">up to that when they come into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">department</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">is what that does is it causes a degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">of cognitive load on the brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s answering a series of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">light card scales they know what answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">is expected of them and you can see them</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">just going through it very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing there is called</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">autonomic processing</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">if you actually create a cognitive load</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">either three positive or three negative</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">then they don&#39;t know what answer you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">expect of them so they have to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">and you get a switch into what is called</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">novelty receptive processing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">cardamom calls this thinking fast and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">thinking slow</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">and one of the great ironies is we knew</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">all about everything that cardamom</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">discovered</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">about 10 years before he discovered it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">it&#39;s just he didn&#39;t walk across to his</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">colleagues in cognitive neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">ask them some questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">so in cognitive neuroscience it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">autonomic and novelty receptive</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">and we don&#39;t flip into novelty receptive</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">processing unless we&#39;ve really got to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">because it consumes a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">remember i said in the first lecture you</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">make a decision on the first fit pattern</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">match</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">it&#39;s low energy cost and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">focuses to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">so the cognitive load gets us into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">secondary form of thinking which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">reality in its nature</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">and so for example if i have six</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">triangles i get 18 data points</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">and you can see then how we scale this</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">because the person who inputs the data</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:11.760" style="s2">is also interpreting it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">so there&#39;s no need for an interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.760" end="00:15:15.680" style="s2">by an algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">or by a qualitative researcher this is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.680" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">quant technique</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">in what is traditionally a qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s important to realize we also</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">have some interesting ones we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">10 plus years now work on patient</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">journey in northern ireland</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">and one of the scales we got there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">actually a canvas which has</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">empathy balanced against pain and people</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">markers on it to say this is how i see</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">it this is how i think the doctor sees</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:46.399" style="s2">it this is how i think the nurse sees it</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.399" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">the patient agency</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">in reporting their own situation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">providing quantitative data of something</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">which would normally just be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">conversation when a medical profession</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:00.639" style="s2">came to the bed</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">and that question of agency is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.639" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">critical one we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">i think the other thing this also does</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">it fits into the feminist literature</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">about epistemic injustice</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">because what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">transferring the power of interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">to the subject</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">rather than somebody from a different</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">cultural background</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:26.079" style="s2">and we&#39;ve done some pioneering work here</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">for example in africa in young girls who</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.079" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">mean subject to genetical mutilation and</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">rape</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:32.560" style="s2">and we&#39;ve had those girls acting as</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">ethnographers</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.560" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">to people at risk of the same horror in</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">their own communities</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">and then they can sit down with people</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">in those communities and show the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">results and say what can we do tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">to create more stories like this and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">fewer stories like those</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">this is the whole new theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to give you some more</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">illustrations in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">to ask somebody what can we do tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">to create more of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">and fewer of those can engage anybody at</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:02.839" style="s2">any educational level</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s no judgment implied in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.839" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">if you say how can we actually create a</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">safer patient environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:12.799" style="s2">everybody will say we&#39;re doing that on</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">the other hand if you show actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.799" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">stories of patients and nurses</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">and say what can we do to have more of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.120" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">these and fewer of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">people can come up with things to do and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">they don&#39;t take it personally</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">right so that&#39;s called vector theory of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">change but the other interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">we did with the guild story is we still</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">clusters of stories indexed the same way</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">and we gave them</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">to experts in female sexual health</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">in washington the hague and london and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">asked them to interpret those stories</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">the way they thought the girls had</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">interpreted them</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:47.679" style="s2">and they interpret them completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">differently so we&#39;re now showing two</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.679" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">pictures say this is what they did in</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">the field this is what you did</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">now that actually is quite powerful when</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">you do that with qualitative researchers</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">because it makes their bias visible</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">yeah and often they haven&#39;t realized it</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">and there are kind of like three</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">responses we see to this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">the legitimate one is okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">different what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">in complexity this is called a gradient</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">you&#39;re an expert</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">yeah you are bound to see it differently</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">from the subject so the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">the oh my god we&#39;ve got to see it like</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">them well the only way you&#39;ll see it</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">like them is if you grow up in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">community and you get yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:29.760" style="s2">genetically mutilated then you might see</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">it like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.760" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">the worst reaction then we get this</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">frequently is they don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">their own stories</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">i&#39;m the expert and you&#39;d be amazed how</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">frequent that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">now we did a big project with roma in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:45.919" style="s2">eastern europe where we used roma</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">children to act as ethnographers to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.919" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">romer adults</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:51.679" style="s2">and when we did the same exercise with</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">the european union anthropologists in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.679" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">vienna</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">that was exactly the reaction we got</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">they do not understand their own stories</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">we are the experts</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">so this is kind of like an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">challenge so that&#39;s the basic approach</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">and what it allows us to do and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">remember i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">strange attractors fitness landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">tropes</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:15.280" style="s2">it allows us to map the different</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">patterns in play</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.280" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">so i can look for example if i&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">mass capture</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">you know the blue cluster here might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">males</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">the green might be females top red might</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">be children whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">this is taking the output of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">six different triangles and it&#39;s a this</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">is a true fitness landscape so basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:40.799" style="s2">the closer things are if something was</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">everything was indexed on the in exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">the same point on all six triangles</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">there&#39;d just be a big thick dot in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">middle</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">so this is a distribution pattern based</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">on indexing so it shows</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">underlying patterns or belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">and when we do this on for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">cultural mapping and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">cultural map so in that case i think in</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">this one we presented cartoons from</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">gaping boy</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">people chose the cartoon which most</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">resonated with their experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">told a story about why and then indexed</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">it onto a set of triangles</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">the labels of which came from cultural</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">anthropology that was kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">research base</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">and so what you actually got in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">picture is different divisions and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">different companies</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">yeah actually mapped as different</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">colored blobs</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">and what that immediately tells you is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">that actually this is going to be an</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">interesting problem you&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">outliers you&#39;ve got like red blob at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.600" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">top</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">which overlaps with some of the greens</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">but it&#39;s completely disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">the blue so that&#39;s a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">think differently</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">remember from the first one when i</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">talked about finding the 17</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">the people who are seeing something</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">other people aren&#39;t seen this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">the ways we do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">and what that actually tells you is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">this one is actually not bad because</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">there are always overlaps</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">so i can nudge the system around so i</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">might click on that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">purple overlap with green in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">okay i need more stories like this and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">fewer stories like the ones on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">extreme on the blue</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">so i can get the system to start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">align</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of like one illustration</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">or one example</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">of the way this works this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">triangle this is actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">ways where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re doing journaling um</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">very valuable process by the way i</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">started on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">knowledge management you get people to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">keep a journal in the software of every</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">time they make a decision and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">from that you produce a map of decision</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">and information flows</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">which is the reality of what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">and the contrast between that and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">process map is always extreme</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">now it&#39;s actually one of the ways you</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">get executives to realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">informal networks are making things work</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">despite the system not because of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">so this is one of the questions when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">made this decision</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">did you analyze it logically act</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">intuitively or make a decision based on</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">three positive values now if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">that you can immediately see that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">organization is going to have a real</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">problem in a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">because they&#39;re very sort of analytical</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">or principle based they&#39;re not good at</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">intuitive instinctive decision making</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">so we can start to see a general pattern</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">this is another of those landscapes this</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">comes from work on conflict management</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">in latin america</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">so what we did here is we presented a</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">perspective on the future peace</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">settlement</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">um the blue is ex army people</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">the green is x terrorists and the red is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">so they&#39;ve all been presented with</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">exactly the same statement</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">and as you can see there&#39;s no connection</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:02.559" style="s2">between green and blue</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">there is absolutely no point in sitting</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.559" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">them down in a workshop and talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:07.919" style="s2">about things</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">is given the same data and the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.919" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">interpretive framework they see things</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">radically differently</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">the one thing you find out when you work</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">with them is they both hate the people</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">in red</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">they regard them as compromises now the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">here which was extremely successful was</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">we took</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">the sort of extreme of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:29.280" style="s2">and we said how can we make this more</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">extreme</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.280" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">and the extreme of the green more</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">extreme</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">so people in the center started to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:38.320" style="s2">coalesce</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">and that was done with more like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.320" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">fuel like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">and we do a lot of this on mapping</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">different attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">different beliefs identifying common</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">areas and it all comes back to this key</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">complexity principle</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">of you&#39;re dealing with dispositional</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">states not causal states</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of like a dispositional</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">um this is another example this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">public example</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">um work we did with um pricewaterhouse</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">looking at attitudes to artificial</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">intelligence and machine augmentation</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">um so exactly the same process across</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">multiple ceos in multiple companies</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">and you can start to start see the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">differences which occur between</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">different countries that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:30.080" style="s2">a general pattern</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">yet to tend towards the top right but if</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">you look at germany and china there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">radical differences between them in</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">terms of the way it works</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">so what we&#39;re really doing here is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">measuring attitudes and that&#39;s critical</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">because attitude&#39;s a lead indicators</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">whereas compliance is a lag indicator</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">so this is used a lot in safety a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">politics and elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">to create a map based on the way people</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">interpret their own data</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">and say okay if we want to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">this this is our starting point remember</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">i said that on day one</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">in convexity you start journeys with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">sense of direction</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t try and achieve goals</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:15.600" style="s2">right so the sense of direction is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">effectively a nurse</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.600" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">this is another example this is where we</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">gather stories about safety in the west</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">coast manufacturer</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">and what you now see is the map for each</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2">division</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">so each division is in a different place</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.880" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">you haven&#39;t got an</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:32.880" style="s2">average for the whole company so the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.880" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">shift the system assuming the top right</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.200" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">is the desired state</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">yeah kind of like you know the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">right hand picture there</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve already got a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">are doing the right sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">whereas actually top left you&#39;re way</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">over in one space</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">so what this allows is intervention at</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">people&#39;s own level of competence to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">a difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">so instead of having an average program</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">across the whole company</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">you instead work on different companies</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">in different divisions</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">and this draws back to something i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">said a few times</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">complexity is about the tales of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">pareto distribution</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">not the center of a normal distribution</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a fat tail and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">that most</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">interventions most plans are based on a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">normal distribution</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">and they don&#39;t realize the level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">diversity within the system</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">so this actually allows us to map the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">overall position and diversity</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">and to give an example of this one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">the big projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">we did in south wales is we got children</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">to act as ethnographers to their</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">own communities in the valleys so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">nobody doesn&#39;t respond to a child on a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">you know the fascinating one by the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">in ohio</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">which was funded by victoria&#39;s secrets</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">on obesity</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">i&#39;m still recovering from that right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">we made children and ethnographers</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">on adult obesity and the children change</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">their eating habits</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">yeah and just think about you know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">you make children</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">investigators of a problem they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:10.640" style="s2">likely to realize it than if you try and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:12.960" style="s2">teach them</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">either way we&#39;ve got kids to gather</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.960" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">stories in the valleys</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">and then we can present to a minister a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">government official</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">the picture for the whole of south</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">quails but then actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">individual councils or individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">community centers could see the picture</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">for their people</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">and that meant the more like this fuel</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">like that intervention</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">was taking place to the level where</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">people could make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">rather than sort of big corporate or</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">government programs as they go down</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">and that also interestingly means you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">get into what are called micro</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">interventions</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">and multiple micro interventions are</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">more successful in nudging a system</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">than macro interventions and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">this is the also the next generation of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">behavioral economics</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">which actually doesn&#39;t really nudge it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">it yanks</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">it&#39;s manipulative what you do here is</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">you map and identify when the system is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">ready to change</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">and then small energy input can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">trigger a change</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">so you don&#39;t start with where you want</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">to be you start with where you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">and you look at the energy gradients</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">this is another example</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">and this is again is from the pwc one</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">and again you can start to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">differences this is key to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">sense making in complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">seeing a pattern which is what we evolve</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">to do as a human species we like</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">responding to that pattern and saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">how do we want to change it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">another one here um this is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">transports</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">yeah and again you can see an identical</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">process running different groups and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">we&#39;re now looking at what&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">what&#39;s the same what&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">as we go through that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">all right so i&#39;ve done that fairly</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">right and apologies for that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">more material which i can</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">send you what i wanted to do really</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">there was to talk about this concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">of managing complex patterns in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">the way we work</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">and this concept of data at scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">now the reason i wanted to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">if you want to actually deal with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">negative trope or a negative concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">let&#39;s take my concept of children all</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">right so we&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">done children&#39;s ethnographers in sweden</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">in wales in singapore in algeria</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">in egypt and in colombia</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">and what we&#39;re working towards at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">moment is a programme</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">in which every 16 year old in every</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">school in the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">can be an ethnographer to their own</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">and capturing stories from that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">community about what works and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">and the key thing on that is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">actually we&#39;re creating an</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">agency in the local community and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">introducing a human buffer</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">into the internet at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.399" style="s2">the internet isn&#39;t effectively an</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:22.640" style="s2">unbuffered feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.399" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">an amber for feedback loops always lead</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.640" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">to perversion</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s to tyranny of the tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">of the herd rather than the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">the crowds to be honest so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:33.039" style="s2">of like a big ambition on this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.039" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">um in patient journey that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">particularly powerful if patients keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">journals and doctors and nurses can look</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">at those journals</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">you give the human agency within the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">system but you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">also in quantitative terms account for</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">so in one project um you can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">patients with identical</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:55.679" style="s2">uh chronic this is chronic pulmonary</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:31:00.240" style="s2">so you can look at patients with</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">identical physiological condition</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.240" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">but with radically different take-ups in</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">oxygen so some people just need it some</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">we can actually account for about 90</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">percent of that variation</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">by the way they interpret their</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">narrative so we&#39;re starting to measure</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">human motivation in complex decision</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">in terms of the way it works and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t take much</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">for you to see how this can be used</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">politically</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">because you&#39;re using real anecdotal data</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:30.840" style="s2">from the field</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">rather than artificial narrative</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">centrally</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">now that leads into this issue about</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">ashby&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">and this comes back to the origins of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">this stuff in counter-terrorism</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">for those who don&#39;t remember ashby ashby</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">is a famous information scientist</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">and he said that only variety can match</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">variety</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">so as variety of input goes up you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">to increase your variety of response</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">now if you look what happens with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">terrorist in government the terrorist</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">actually is doing small things but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">government doesn&#39;t know what they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">there are thousands of things they</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">should pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">so the cost of preventing terrorism goes</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:11.600" style="s2">out of all proportion</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">effectively they get pushed up the ashby</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.600" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">what we started to do with darpa was and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">this is kind of like where we got into</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">the concept of children</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">is a government can use its citizens as</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">sensors</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">a company can use its citizens as</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:29.919" style="s2">sensors</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">so the energy cost of processing large</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.919" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">volumes of data</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:35.679" style="s2">is distributed into a network not into</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">the center</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.679" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">right so that actually means you start</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">to gain asymmetric advantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">at the same time you start to stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">the terrorists</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">so you start to throw information at</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">that they have to take account of and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">that forces them apache peace curve</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s a point where you cross over</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">where you gain strategic advantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">now i remember i was presenting this to</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">a one of those conferences in maryland</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">where it takes you about two hours to</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">get through security to get in</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">you present it to an audience and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">send you out to the room because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">not security cleared but they have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">discussion and then they bring you back</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">in to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">and you know what they were talking now</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a crazy system i&#39;ve been through it</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">many times in my life</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">and somebody from the back of the hall</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">said well give me an example of what we</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">could do to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">al-qaeda and i don&#39;t know whether you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.840" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">ever been in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">but um you think of the perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">question but the wrong example for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">audience but then you can&#39;t get it out</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">of your mind right so this is american</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">intelligence people</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">so i just gave up and went for it and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">said well the next time</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">sharon comes to washington remember the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">israeli prime minister</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">you arrest him as a war criminal and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">there was his stunned silence</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">over the hall and somebody from the back</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">of the hall said what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:58.399" style="s2">that buddy</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">now for people who know you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.399" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">it this is a danger sign you know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">you mean by that buddy</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">i found with americans is a warning sign</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">right it&#39;s like the rattlers tail</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">uh and i thought oh how how the hell do</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">i get out of here right the only route i</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">know to the dulles airport is the lease</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">retreat from gettysburg maybe it will</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">work a second time right so i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:20.399" style="s2">and i said well what would al qaeda do</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.399" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">it would take so much energy to counter</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">something completely unexpected that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">they would have to reveal so much to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">you could do something about it and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">eventually got it</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">so this question about using networks to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">give yourself advantage</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">because networks have cognitive cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">diversity within them</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s how you start to rethink things</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">like ashby&#39;s law and attributes</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">limitations</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">and human network in human sensing as i</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">said before is based on patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">so uh in the first talk i talked</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">generally about sense making i took five</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">about five schools of sense making i</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">then went on to kinevin from that i went</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">on to apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve now completed with narrative-based</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.240" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">sense making</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">um i could have done a lot more than</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">that all right i mean four four hours</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">um but i wanted to finish with something</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">which is eminently practical and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">eminently scalable</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ll come back to this key principle</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">in complexity you start journeys you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">don&#39;t try and achieve goals</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">well if you&#39;re going to start a journey</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">you need a map of the territory to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">which pathways are possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">and which pathways are impossible and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">you need to stop this goal-based</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">achievement and start</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">and you know a vector is direction and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">speed of travel for intensity of effort</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">so open to questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">arguments disputes beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">um so yeah if you have any questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">start throwing them in the chats</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:57.920" style="s2">uh i have one cooking up but i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">want to sit on it for a bit so i will</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">take in andy</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">uh andy and then these questions could</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">be about this lecture or all the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">lectures we heard today</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">or throughout the series so andy you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">um you talked about the value</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:18.520" style="s2">in both complex and complicated</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">systems of um</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.520" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">interdisciplinary generalists can you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">how you value the relative competency</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">of interdisciplinary generalists in</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">other words</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">how do you quantify i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">difficult i mean i think in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">complicated space you can have genuine</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">experts you don&#39;t need generalists</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">yeah you do when they come into conflict</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s a special liminal domain</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">um complexity which has novel</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">uncertainty requires journalists now i</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">think there are two false models on this</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">one is the neo-journalist concept</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">which links in with the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">t-shape</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">right so the t-shape is i&#39;m deep expert</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">in one area but i know a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">about others that&#39;s not a generalist</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">because your own discipline will</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">dominate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">a journalist knows a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">many things and has the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">synthesize them</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">they also know enough to know what they</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">so they know when to call in according</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">to deep specialist</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">now my own view on this to be honest is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s something a famous phrase from</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">kierkegaard nature may deal the cards</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:39.040" style="s2">but nurture plays them</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">yeah which which i&#39;m very fond of right</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">so i think first of all you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">have to have the sort of early childhood</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">which actually creates the right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">cortex and other connections</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">and also the right physical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">remember the idea that your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">co-located with your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">is actually a very it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">cartesianism cartesian concepts of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">consciousness is distributed function of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">the brain the body it&#39;s social</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">environment it&#39;s narrative etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">um sorry i&#39;m jumping around too much so</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">a generalist right if you have the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">upbringing</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">and you&#39;re constantly encountering</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">different things and you have an</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">inquisitive household and you argue</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">about multiple subjects over dinner</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re not afraid to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">conversations with your friends about</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">things and you read a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">you gradually go to be a generalist um</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">in the school i went to and this was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">norm in welsh grammar schools</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">we used to do impromptu debating every</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">week which means you&#39;d walk to the front</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">of the class and you&#39;d be given a card</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">and it would say support capital</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">punishment that was my first one</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">i hate capital punishment i think people</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">who supported are evil</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">um but i had to argue for it without</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">warning and without preparation for</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">seven minutes we did that every week</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">from the age of 11 to 18.</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">yeah that means you read everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">you you never know what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">deal with and that generation and there</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">are very few generalists left under the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">age of 50</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">in the uk because the educational system</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">became modular</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">and specialist and by the time you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">your early 20s unless you suffer trauma</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">the brain is plastic isn&#39;t plastic</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">um just as a sideline on that by the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">if you want innovation you want young</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">people to know people that the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">plastic up until about 1819 and plastic</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">again after about 40</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">50 naturally it&#39;s it&#39;s synthesis and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">integration with older people</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">and novelty and younger people between</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">about 25 and 45 forget it you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">in the structure of the community you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:48.800" style="s2">in and you&#39;re not going to change much</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:51.119" style="s2">now we do a lot with what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.800" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">transgenerational pairing</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.119" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">yeah put in very young people with older</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">people so you&#39;ve got sort of bright</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">ideas and idealism</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">coupled with a bit of cynicism and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">knowledge and network</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">so i think we need desperately need</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">generalists but we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">breed them</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">and try and train them right</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">remember i talked about acceptation in</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">the first thing generalists see</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">acceptive connections naturally</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">now there are one class of people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">are quite good at it</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re people who are partially</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">dyslectic not disabled dyslexic but</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">partially dyslexic</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">sorry i i fit into this category so i</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">know about it all right if the spell</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">checker doesn&#39;t pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t get it just don&#39;t get it um but</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">the thing about dyslexia is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">constantly making connections between</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t see the individual components</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t build things up in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">structured way</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing connections between</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s a very strong correlation</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">between dyslexia and innovation</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">the other one which is actually also</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">really interesting i&#39;ve worked with two</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:58.800" style="s2">signal cesiats in my time</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:40:59.760" style="s2">um silent series acts are cross wired so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">for example they see</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.760" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">text as colors so they literally</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">can&#39;t sit read some writing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:09.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in an ugly color</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">yeah and those people can also see</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.920" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">connections that other people don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">and i think where we are now overall on</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">this is that so-called educational</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">deficiencies are actually part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:23.599" style="s2">you need people on the autistic end of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">the spectrum you need people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.599" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">dyslectic you need people who have</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">sinusiac</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:32.839" style="s2">the system needs that variety within it</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">sorry you hit me on one of my pet</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.839" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">subjects</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">um alex</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:47.200" style="s2">warren you had a question oh cool</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">yeah super stoked uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.200" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">okay so maybe you&#39;ll chalk me up as uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">in the mode of uh reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">organizations having a religious</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">thesis um so i</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">uh like a little bit of context as i did</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">in 18</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">month uh like business and leadership</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">and then in practice uh we did a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:10.880" style="s2">of like interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">looking interpersonal patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.880" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">reactivity and it&#39;s kind of like healing</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">training a state of being uh and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">that state of being enabled</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">a group of 40 people we like got in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">fishbowl</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">and uh there&#39;s like three women in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">middle that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">channeled a purpose for us around</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">self-organizing our last retreat and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">then that retreat was this magical</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">experience with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">serendipity and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:43.520" style="s2">my question is uh like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">with sensemaker with with this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">ability to get like larger amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">people like is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">like uh like i have this example of 40</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">people experiencing collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:54.560" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">so i&#39;m wondering like what would it be</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.560" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">like for 400 people to have this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">sense of self-awareness and and also a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">suggestion is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">uh or possibilities i wonder if the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">stella could use uh sensemaker and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">and like what sort like yeah like how do</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:13.520" style="s2">you react to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">i think different things i mean once a</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.520" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">year i teach meditation with a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">all right and i come at it from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">point of view of ignatius loyola&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">spiritual exercises and she comes at it</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">from a buddhist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:31.280" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">body on the body of religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:35.119" style="s2">and the way that people interact in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">religious environments</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.119" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">and particularly if you have a very high</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:40.079" style="s2">degree of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">ritual i think one of the big mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.079" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">the catholic church made was to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">of the latin mass and to get the priest</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">to face the populace</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">because it lost the ritual and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">universality of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">and you know i was strongly in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">vatican ii and peace and justice and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">liberation theology but i think that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">so you can actually change the way that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">people think in those environments</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">the trouble is once you go beyond a</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">certain level it almost inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">becomes a cult</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">and if if you actually speak to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">audiences you know this all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">bigger audiences are much easier to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">manipulate than small audiences</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">yeah i think the proximity causes a</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:22.400" style="s2">reaction</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">um so i think and i i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.400" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">let the spiritual i mean i think if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">look at the evidence coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">evolutionary psychology</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">uh human beings are religious by</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">you can&#39;t get rid of it if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">read richard dawkins and go to his</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">he&#39;s created a new religion called</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">scientism and he&#39;s the first prophet he</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">even has testimonies to people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">became atheists after they heard him</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">preach all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">so he&#39;s following the exact form um and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">i think this goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">the fact that we evolved in abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">means we can&#39;t avoid a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">something material or other</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">we&#39;re running a program at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">you might be interested in where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">looking at the role of the numinous in</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">human sense making</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">yeah that goes back to otto&#39;s concept of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">the idea of holy so</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">things like religion and the sense of or</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">i mean i was in lake district lake</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">district on the when that sense of war</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">at 3 000 feet where you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">landscape open up before you</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.359" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something about that which</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">is human right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">we need those elements yeah i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">that&#39;s where we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">sensemaker because what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">do is to show</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">differences yeah and show this is this</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">perspective this is this perspective why</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">are they different what do you think can</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:41.680" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">rather than trying to homogenize people</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">and i think the danger is once you go</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">above 30 40 50</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">in a small facilitated group</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">you tend to get homogenization because</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">people won&#39;t depart from the norm</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">because they get excluded</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s scale things like sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">maker work but i wanted to go through</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:01.119" style="s2">that first bit because i think those</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">sort of experiences are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">critical</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.400" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t have them when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.960" style="s2">young you you become</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">you lose a lot right that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.960" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">something other than yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">i mean when i&#39;m with mary boone in</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">connecticut</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">um i stay in a house and she</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m a catholic all right but i go</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2">to a protestant church</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">and to be quite honest in connecticut</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">they all go to church but i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">they sing a couple of hymns just for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">sake of it but then the sermon is all</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">palestine or trump or something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">that and then they all sort the politics</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">out afterwards over tea and coffee</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">and i think if you go to the catholic</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">church in ireland you&#39;ll see the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">religion centers the community it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">separate from the community it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">but you did ask me about metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">last time so it was in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">all right uh richard you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">uh we can&#39;t hear you richard</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.160" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">my mike&#39;s broken yeah it&#39;s you we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.319" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">hear you now okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">um zoom was telling me my mic was broken</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">um this is a very basic question dave my</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">brain has exploded again listening to</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">you but</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:22.839" style="s2">um with the triads when i thought about</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">using them</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.839" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">um one issue that has sort of comes up</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">is how does</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s completing them how do</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">they differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">how do you differentiate between</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">somebody who wants to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">none of the none of these in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">the vertices and</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">somebody who wants to say all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">but sort of roughly equally</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">uh there&#39;s another applicable button so</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.559" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">say it doesn&#39;t apply um</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">we sometimes actually dismiss stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">the center anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">yeah um in terms of sense making and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2">think the thing to remember about</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">sense making you&#39;re looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:02.319" style="s2">pattern not precision this is what</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">people need to understand about</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">yeah the pattern matters you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t have precision a priori</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">because the system is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">shifting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">so whether that so that that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s done it&#39;s it&#39;s an n a type function</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.559" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">or you can move triads around and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">can actually link them with dyads and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">give relative weight</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:30.000" style="s2">do you always use positive i mean i know</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">you try and use things that are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">have equal weight um</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">but all positive we&#39;re all negative</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">all positive are all negative right but</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">you never have a positive and two</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">negatives because people then know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">you want</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s quite interesting i mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">one thing we found</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">balancing three things gets you better</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">results than</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">a simple than say three linear scales</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">so one things we found on the pw study</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">for example they&#39;d ask people what was</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">important in the company yeah and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">had strategic intent</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">operational effectiveness ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">disrupt the market and when there were</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">three lecture scales they were all</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:14.559" style="s2">scored at 95</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:16.319" style="s2">when we put them onto a triangle we got</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.559" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">radically different patterns</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.319" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">so we found out what was actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">important to people</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">thanks thanks richard um</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">peter you had a question peter s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">i think ah which oh peter s that s</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">okay go ahead peter oh that was you</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">peter that&#39;s the one i was uh with</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">statistics yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll take the other peter in a moment i</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">was i was kind of curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">statistical framing</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">that might be appropriate as you go from</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">qualitative into quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">information is this based in a bayesian</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">statistics or a frequentist because</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">frequent as i was hearing like like long</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">tails</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">and it made me think okay we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">thinking about the mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">and uh normal distributions</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:10.480" style="s2">but when people are doing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">self ethnography</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">does that are they sort of up uh more of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">a bayesian kind of updating their</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">assumptions and probabilities of where</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">as they interpret their own stories i</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re doing anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">anything remotely that&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">sophisticated all right what they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.760" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">is six triangles and they&#39;ve got a dot</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">and they move the dot around on each</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">triangle to the comfortable with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">relative position</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s what they do okay we also</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">diodes and we have what we call stones</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">so we have various geometrical</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">shapes and we&#39;re trying to do this on</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">mass</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">so one individual results really doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re trying to look for results</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">over a large number</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">i normally explain it by talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">difference between pareto and gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">distributions</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">um partly because that&#39;s you know you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">can basically say look you can use</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">you know the center of a gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">distribution is complicated</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a common pattern you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a many-to-many relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:17.280" style="s2">but as you move towards the tails of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:20.319" style="s2">pareto distribution you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:21.839" style="s2">a few to many relationship and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.319" end="00:51:23.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve got weak signals you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.839" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">variety</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.119" end="00:51:26.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you do the other name</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">for this and i prefer logic</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.800" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">is is called adductive research so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:34.800" style="s2">have deductive inductive abductive</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">yeah so inductive research assumes once</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.800" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got enough data</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">all the cases of a have b you can assume</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">a causal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">abductive research which is a great</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">contribution of american philosophy to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">logic</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">is sometimes under the logic of hunches</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">so what&#39;s the most what&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">logical connection between apparently</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2">unconnected things</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:52:00.480" style="s2">and the problem of abduction this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:02.839" style="s2">what poindexter set me to solve is how</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.480" end="00:52:06.400" style="s2">do you create objective approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.839" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">abduction so how is your intuitive leap</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">more objective than my intuitive leap</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s where sensemaker comfort came</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">because if i present the same result the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">same data to a thousand people and get</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">them to interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:23.359" style="s2">the patterns of the interpretation give</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:23.359" style="s2">me objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">now then within that you can play all</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">sorts of grains with spearman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">coefficient and things like this so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">do a hell of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">statistics with the data but the key</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">the primary meaning comes from the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">people interpret the data not from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.160" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">the narrative is in explainums</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not the primary meaning</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">did that make sense or did it make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">worse it did a bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">it made a lot better um i was imagining</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">also sort of an organizational context</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">uh the bosses the executives would want</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">to have some statistical power to</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">understand how they were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s maybe against the point of of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">now it&#39;s actually very important what i</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">say is what sensemaker does is it gives</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">you the objectivity of numbers and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2">explanatory power of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">but it puts them together all right</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">and you need them together right other</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">otherwise it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:26.800" style="s2">won&#39;t work and it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">effective at changing executives</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.800" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">um because the numbers drag them in they</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">pay attention to it but then they read</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">the stories and they start to understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">what the numbers mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:39.359" style="s2">yeah and that can be really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:40.079" style="s2">because they discover it for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.359" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">rather than you</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.079" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">telling them as a consultant</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">all right we&#39;ll do uh take in your long</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">lost relative the other</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">peter s peter snowden with the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">spelling yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">um yeah thank you again for</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">this session really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">stimulating and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">um this follows on quite well from what</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">you were just saying i think um</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;ve been involved over the years</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">and both as an observer from outside and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.079" end="00:54:16.720" style="s2">as uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">inside making things happen in um this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.720" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">sort of overlap zone between</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">participatory development projects and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">participatory media projects and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">one of my impressions enduring</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:28.240" style="s2">impressions that often the people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">run the project are bringing</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.240" end="00:54:34.400" style="s2">agency into a context that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">that is going to end up extracting the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">value from the agency</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">and throwing the agency away once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">left and so i&#39;m interested in what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">said about</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">just there about um you know changing</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">executives but i&#39;m also interested</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:48.799" style="s2">in you know the projects you were</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">talking about before working with</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.799" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">patient journaling in wales and</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:54.640" style="s2">i mean what is that that you&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">over the years which</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.640" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">um can help to tip the balance</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">particularly when you&#39;re coming in as</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:03.599" style="s2">what i i suppose you might call the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">junior partner yeah not the person</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.599" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">bringing the money</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">i think i mean there&#39;s several things</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:09.040" style="s2">all right we did some work around</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">grenville</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.040" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">yeah which if you don&#39;t know was the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">tower block which went up in flames and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">god knows how many people died</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:21.119" style="s2">now this to me proved the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">facilitating workshops for sense making</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.119" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">because people had workshops they</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">gathered narrative it was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">participative action research</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">yeah and i&#39;ve got a long-standing set of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">disagreements with participative action</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">research because it privileges the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">facilitator over those facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">yeah and also the facilitator can</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">influence too much what comes out of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:48.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s two things that we work on</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">first of all when we develop our methods</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.480" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">we did them all in denmark so we could</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">facilitate in english and people would</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">speak in danish and we couldn&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:58.400" style="s2">what they were saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">and we actually remove facilitators from</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.400" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">the process we don&#39;t let them engage</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">yeah because then they&#39;re too powerful</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">and that real and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:08.160" style="s2">facilitators who hate that because they</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">like to be the person who gets the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.160" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">meaningful story</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">the second thing is if you make people</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:17.200" style="s2">ethnographers to their own condition</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">on a distributed basis over time</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:20.559" style="s2">you give them an evidence based to argue</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">their position</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.559" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">because normally they&#39;re disabled</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have evidence</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">they&#39;re reliant on the third party</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">expert coming in what narrative</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:31.520" style="s2">databases do</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">is they give them that statistical</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.520" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">evidence to support their arguments</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:38.799" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s the most sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:40.960" style="s2">basis so to me that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.799" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">and as i said the concept of epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.960" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">justice is critical to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">um because it&#39;s the way that i mean beth</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">smith who works for me he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">wonderful way of phrasing that she says</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">to if you want to understand epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">injustice old wives tell tales</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">old men are philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:01.839" style="s2">yeah which is actually quite a good way</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:04.839" style="s2">of expressing it all right</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.839" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">and power does it power comes in</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.839" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">not in source material yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:14.559" style="s2">that&#39;s where you get corruption so</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">we we push that power of interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.559" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">right into the community and away from</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">and some quality searches absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">hate that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.119" end="00:57:28.319" style="s2">so in a way it&#39;s not that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.799" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">magic wand you can wave</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.319" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">at the people in power but that you can</p>

<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">not by exactly and also i think it also</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">means advocacy is taught based into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:51.760" style="s2">so if you go to a politician you say</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve got 5000 narratives here collected</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.760" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">from 3 000 constituents self-interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:59.040" style="s2">by them and this is the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">they pay attention if you go and say</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:02.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve done a study and run a workshop and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">they don&#39;t like the result they just</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.400" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">ignore you</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:08.640" style="s2">so the and i mean i give an illustration</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:10.240" style="s2">we did one on um</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.640" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">reasons for leaving the air force in</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.240" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">australia so that they had a large</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">amount of people to you know take in</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:18.240" style="s2">early retirement</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s very expensive so we pulled</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">in 3 000 stories in a week from</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">offices and spouses of offices</p>

<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">environments is often much better than</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">going to the military people themselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">and the prompting question we had for</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:35.839" style="s2">that is imagine you&#39;re a grandparent</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">and your grandchild says they want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.839" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">join the air force what story will you</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">tell them</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">which got lots of stuff right so sit</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">under the bird on the stick in canberra</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:47.920" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">no deference to the americans giving</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.920" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">them an american eagle they call it the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:54.319" style="s2">bird on a stick with the implication</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">they&#39;re going to barbecue it right</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.319" end="00:58:57.680" style="s2">and we had an absolute correlation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.680" end="00:59:01.599" style="s2">poor leadership willingness to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">air force and recent implementation of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.599" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">lean six sigma</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">now this is not something the head of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">the air force wanted to hear</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">because six sigma was his pet project</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:14.799" style="s2">um and he&#39;d insisted on having this</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">question about which major initiative</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.799" end="00:59:18.640" style="s2">does this relate to so now he was you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:20.240" style="s2">know eating his own words</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">and he looked at the squadron leader at</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.240" end="00:59:22.400" style="s2">the bottom of the table that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.400" end="00:59:26.799" style="s2">captain in in terms of people not who</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">are british right</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.799" end="00:59:31.119" style="s2">and he said we by which he means you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t communicated hour</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.119" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">by which he meant my six sigma policy</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">properly</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">this is a classic senior executive they</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">don&#39;t like it it&#39;s your bloody fault for</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">not telling them</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">go and tell them harder and i remember</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.599" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">saying so we don&#39;t know look at the data</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:48.240" style="s2">yeah you got the screen up there so just</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">click on it and you can see the story</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.240" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">and remember the question what story</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">would you tell them if your</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">grandchildren the first one which comes</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:56.720" style="s2">out was i&#39;ll shoot them first and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll be grateful</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">and he went that&#39;s some disgruntled</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">young officer and i said i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">look at the demographics</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">30-year service female warrant officer</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">now if you know anything about military</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">environments you&#39;ll know that we now</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.040" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">have absolute silence around the table</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">this means they&#39;ve got a real problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.359" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">and he clicks on the next one and i</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">always love this one the title of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">story and the names people give stories</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:20.799" style="s2">are often more significant than the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:22.480" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.799" end="01:00:24.799" style="s2">was why do we have to under the</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:24.799" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">and it was a new base which had been set</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.799" end="01:00:29.359" style="s2">up in a temporary camp on the red desert</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:32.079" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.359" end="01:00:34.640" style="s2">bureaucracy of lean six sigma meant they</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.079" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">hadn&#39;t got a mobile latrine</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.640" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">so they were having to dig holes in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:40.480" style="s2">desert instead</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">now that&#39;s bad enough in the uk but</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.480" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:44.480" style="s2">live in holes in the ground in australia</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:46.400" style="s2">you would don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.480" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">unsighted bear skin you know they have</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:50.480" style="s2">eight of the world&#39;s 10 most poisonous</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">snakes and so on</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.480" end="01:00:53.599" style="s2">and he looked at that and he got up from</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:55.599" style="s2">the table walked to his desk and had a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.599" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">very quiet conversation with somebody if</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">you again if you know military quiet</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">conversations are scary shouting is okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:04.319" style="s2">and i gather over the next hour</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">helicopters flew in mobile latrines to</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.319" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">the space to the point where they had a</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">surf it and the staff sergeant sold the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">extras on his internal black market so</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">everybody was happy</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">but then he came and sat at the table he</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">said we&#39;ve taken six sigma too far</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">yeah now that was numbers and narrative</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s what i call see attend act</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:25.520" style="s2">he paid attention to something because</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.520" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">of the numbers and he acted differently</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">because of the narrative</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.480" end="01:01:35.520" style="s2">thanks great cool</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:37.200" style="s2">so we&#39;re at the hour are you good to</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.520" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">stay 15 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.200" end="01:01:42.799" style="s2">over cool so i have a question</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">um let&#39;s see if i can formulate this uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.799" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe it&#39;s a device too for for</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:49.280" style="s2">the stowawa</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:51.119" style="s2">so one of the strange attractors at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.280" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">stoa is</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.119" end="01:01:55.440" style="s2">i guess i would say authentic dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">uh having setting the conditions for</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.440" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">people who strongly disagree with each</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">other have deep disagreements to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:02.160" style="s2">conversations and so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">experimenting with a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.160" end="01:02:04.799" style="s2">intersubjective</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:06.240" style="s2">conversations focusing on enabling</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.799" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">constraints of them</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.240" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">um and it&#39;s interesting because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">dyslexic or mildly dyslexic and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:13.119" style="s2">pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">at code switching and speaking different</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.119" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">kind of perspectives and using terms and</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">and whatever and i think this is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">affords me</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.520" end="01:02:29.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s what afforded like susan</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">blackmore to dome chomsky to like you</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.200" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">alexander duke and to come in to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:34.480" style="s2">store and feel warm by the the digital</p>

<p begin="01:02:34.480" end="01:02:37.760" style="s2">um and then the code switching i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.079" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">it affords two things it like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.760" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">camouflage like you said it scrambles</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.680" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">the pattern matching</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">but also uh it&#39;s like mimikri in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:49.440" style="s2">you gesture to the terms of their own</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">strange attractor</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.440" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">um as it&#39;s almost like a trojan horse so</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:56.720" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">if if if that&#39;s a strategy that works</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.720" end="01:03:00.799" style="s2">and someone&#39;s not gonna meet someone and</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:02.480" style="s2">if we could be more sophisticated about</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.799" end="01:03:04.319" style="s2">it here in order to like</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.480" end="01:03:05.760" style="s2">trojan horse them into our strange</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">attractor</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.760" end="01:03:10.319" style="s2">well as you know i joined so when when</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:13.839" style="s2">you don&#39;t have them at midnight my time</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.319" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">right i&#39;ll come on them right um</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s been enjoyable having the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">conversation i think the conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:19.359" style="s2">some way more valuable than the</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">presentation</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.359" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">um if i was in your shoes i would run</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:26.960" style="s2">fewer sessions and longer ones</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.039" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s just such a richness in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.960" end="01:03:30.079" style="s2">amount you&#39;re offering it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:31.920" style="s2">to follow it all and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.079" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">you end up like this discussion could</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.920" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">probably go on for an hour and it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">better for it to go on for an hour than</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">something else right so i would say that</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:40.480" style="s2">i&#39;d also look at the tricopticon method</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">which i think i sent you</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.480" end="01:03:44.079" style="s2">which is where you bring three experts</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">together and then they debate in another</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.079" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">people debate around them</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s something we developed over</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">the last five years to handle how do you</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:53.760" style="s2">get people from different backgrounds to</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">have different dialogue and not dominate</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2">the group</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.119" end="01:03:58.400" style="s2">um so i think that there&#39;s other things</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.200" end="01:03:59.960" style="s2">like that i would look at</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.400" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">right because if we want to create this</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.960" end="01:04:03.760" style="s2">interdisciplinary world</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:05.920" style="s2">we need disciplines to compete with each</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:09.119" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.920" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">okay and um yeah the synthesis then is</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.119" end="01:04:12.319" style="s2">quite fascinating is what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:14.720" style="s2">doing on retreats the one we&#39;re doing on</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.319" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">semiotics and aesthetics</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.720" end="01:04:19.119" style="s2">we&#39;re bringing together a woman who does</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">origami and understands the science of</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:23.520" style="s2">that in the mathematics of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">together with people who are a pure fine</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.520" end="01:04:26.960" style="s2">artist together with musicians together</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:29.359" style="s2">with people who understand the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">neuroscience of it and we&#39;re throwing</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.359" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">them together in this highly structured</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:36.880" style="s2">environment over five days</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:39.680" style="s2">right and i&#39;ve always been opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.880" end="01:04:42.400" style="s2">things like open space</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.680" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">because open space allows people to walk</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.400" end="01:04:47.440" style="s2">away from things they should</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.920" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">pay attention to so we we tend to</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.440" end="01:04:52.319" style="s2">orchestrate dances in which people have</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">personal safety but they&#39;re having to</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.319" end="01:04:56.240" style="s2">face up or talk with people they</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:57.359" style="s2">can&#39;t walk away from them they have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.240" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">listen to that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.359" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">and then respond</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.480" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">cool thank you um</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.000" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">anjan you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.319" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">hey dave um</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:20.319" style="s2">i i&#39;m trying to feel for the question</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:22.160" style="s2">i i&#39;m basically curious where</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.319" end="01:05:23.680" style="s2">people just innately quote unquote</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.160" end="01:05:27.119" style="s2">common sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.680" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">kind of embody complexity thinking um</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.119" end="01:05:30.319" style="s2">and where is it kind of lost in</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:33.599" style="s2">education or</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.319" end="01:05:35.920" style="s2">growing up uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.599" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">i sometimes call complexity the science</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.920" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">of common sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">yeah and if you haven&#39;t heard the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.039" end="01:05:44.400" style="s2">children&#39;s party story i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">perform it now you can look it up online</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.400" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s loads of version of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:50.319" style="s2">all right basically we all manage our</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:52.799" style="s2">families in our relationships is complex</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.319" end="01:05:55.119" style="s2">adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.799" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">now we we we know that we can&#39;t predict</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.119" end="01:05:59.119" style="s2">the future we can change</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">if anybody&#39;s got teenage children you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.119" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">know you put a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">deep manipulative effort into managing</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">the dispositional state so they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:07.359" style="s2">likely to do good things than bad things</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.839" end="01:06:08.319" style="s2">but you can&#39;t control the outcome all</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.359" end="01:06:09.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.319" end="01:06:12.720" style="s2">teenagers are good for teaching</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">complexity so i think it is the way we</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.720" end="01:06:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it is a natural science all right</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">that&#39;s really important to understand</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.039" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">this is not a social</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">science this is a natural science and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:25.440" style="s2">where i came from the start i think in</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:27.119" style="s2">education the danger is we get</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.440" end="01:06:29.680" style="s2">ideological about this</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.119" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">so for example some of the stuff we know</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.680" end="01:06:32.640" style="s2">when i was a kid we had to learn a poem</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">every week</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.640" end="01:06:37.039" style="s2">and we complained like hell about it um</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">but it actually turns out doing that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.039" end="01:06:40.079" style="s2">hugely valuable for your cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.079" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">in terms of the way his brain and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">brain is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:49.039" style="s2">developing all societies</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:50.720" style="s2">constrain young people in order that</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.039" end="01:06:52.240" style="s2">they can learn and then the constraints</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.720" end="01:06:54.400" style="s2">get relaxed</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.240" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">so i think part of the danger is you</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.400" end="01:06:58.799" style="s2">know some of the ideas in education are</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:00.640" style="s2">based on how i would like to be educated</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:03.039" style="s2">now i&#39;m 40 years old</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.640" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">not what somebody is 10 or 11 or 12</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.039" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">actually needs</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">in terms of development right um and i</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.000" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">there was a big thing grew up in the 70s</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.920" end="01:07:15.839" style="s2">and 80s and probably cognitive for</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:18.079" style="s2">science has overtaken this but</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.839" end="01:07:20.079" style="s2">of the sort of adult development models</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.079" end="01:07:21.680" style="s2">and adult maturity models</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.079" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">and those that come across into the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.680" end="01:07:26.559" style="s2">coaching sector intact without</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:29.119" style="s2">validating the science behind them</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.559" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">and i think any linear hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.119" end="01:07:32.960" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:32.960" style="s2">is actually dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.000" end="01:07:38.000" style="s2">right we we have this love of linear</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.000" end="01:07:40.880" style="s2">hierarchical models because</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.000" end="01:07:43.200" style="s2">it it actually it privileges the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.880" end="01:07:44.960" style="s2">consultant it privileges the facilitator</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.200" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">it privileges the coach</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.960" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">it is there because they&#39;re custodian</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">the model and they have to take you</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:50.559" style="s2">through it</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:51.920" style="s2">yeah and i think that&#39;s dangerous i</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.559" end="01:07:53.760" style="s2">don&#39;t think that i think it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.920" end="01:07:56.319" style="s2">science anyway</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.760" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">so there are aspects of traditional</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.319" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">education which have value</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:03.920" style="s2">but remember traditional education i</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:05.920" style="s2">mean we did exams at 16 and 18</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.920" end="01:08:08.799" style="s2">and we have plenty of time between it to</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.920" end="01:08:10.880" style="s2">think and play and explore ideas</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.799" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">my kids had to do a module like every</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.880" end="01:08:14.640" style="s2">six to eight weeks so they got into i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:17.440" style="s2">got to pass the exam in this i&#39;ll focus</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.640" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">on this i&#39;ll take the box i&#39;ll move on</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.440" end="01:08:22.480" style="s2">so there was no room for exploration we</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:24.719" style="s2">used to play in the streets</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.480" end="01:08:26.000" style="s2">and you had to learn to live with people</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:27.679" style="s2">who you didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.000" end="01:08:29.839" style="s2">i mean my children spent all their time</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.679" end="01:08:32.880" style="s2">getting bust to safe environments</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.839" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">yeah um so we we</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.880" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">we i think one of the big things in</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">education is we</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">you know we used to go and play in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">fields we disappear at 8 00 am in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">morning and come back for dinner</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:46.159" style="s2">right and that&#39;s sort of freedom and</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:48.080" style="s2">exploration has just been driven out of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.159" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">society at the moment and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.080" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">also part of education</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.480" end="01:08:58.799" style="s2">if i could ask the the compliment as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.120" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">follow-up um</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.799" end="01:09:02.080" style="s2">where does where does common sense and</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">complexity thinking most</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.080" end="01:09:05.359" style="s2">diverge i eat where should you trust</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.359" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">common sense um</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:13.199" style="s2">i think what it depends all right i</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.600" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.199" end="01:09:18.159" style="s2">complexity is difficult for people from</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:20.640" style="s2">northern europe and north america</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.159" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s actually much easier to explain it</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.640" end="01:09:28.239" style="s2">in southern europe or asia or africa</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:30.640" style="s2">and the reason in north america and um</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.239" end="01:09:32.960" style="s2">northern europe is the dominance of</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.640" end="01:09:34.560" style="s2">social atheism</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.960" end="01:09:36.159" style="s2">so there&#39;s a famous experiment in</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.560" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">geography of thought which i recommend</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.159" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">you run it ask people what&#39;s the odd one</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">of cow chicken and grass</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.799" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">all right so just have a think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.080" end="01:09:47.679" style="s2">got cow chicken and grass what is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:49.600" style="s2">odd one out</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.679" end="01:09:51.600" style="s2">the dominant northern european north</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.600" end="01:09:53.199" style="s2">american is to get rid of grass</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.600" end="01:09:55.760" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got two animals and one</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.199" end="01:09:57.040" style="s2">vegetable the dominant southern europe</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.760" end="01:10:01.040" style="s2">celtic fringe of</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">of britain africa asia is to eliminate</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.040" end="01:10:05.760" style="s2">chicken because the cow has got a</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:08.080" style="s2">relationship with grass</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.760" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">yeah and communitarian cultures think in</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.080" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">terms of relationships</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">whereas atomistic cultures think in</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.000" end="01:10:15.920" style="s2">terms of categories</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:18.320" style="s2">and also northern europe europe and</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.920" end="01:10:20.480" style="s2">north america is where the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">has the biggest impact</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.480" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">and the belief in causality and linear</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:26.159" style="s2">material causality which comes from</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:28.719" style="s2">count onwards</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.159" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s very very difficult to break</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.719" end="01:10:33.920" style="s2">somebody from those backgrounds into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:35.840" style="s2">concept that some systems are not causal</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.920" end="01:10:38.080" style="s2">where if somebody is a taoist it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.840" end="01:10:39.600" style="s2">because they know some things just are</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.080" end="01:10:41.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason for them to be they</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.600" end="01:10:45.520" style="s2">might be different next time and i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">that that&#39;s where you get the difficulty</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.520" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">i i blame protestantism for this by the</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:52.000" style="s2">way it says heap of the mischievous grin</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.080" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">and actually i&#39;m right because what</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.000" end="01:10:55.679" style="s2">protandism did is it&#39;s all about your</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:57.600" style="s2">individual interpretation of the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.679" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">in your individual relationship with god</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.600" end="01:11:04.239" style="s2">and to hell with the community</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.239" style="s2">yeah and and that&#39;s where it comes from</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.000" end="01:11:12.640" style="s2">all right um chris c</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.280" end="01:11:13.520" style="s2">you had a question if you&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">curious about</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.120" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">how we might bring these process</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:35.440" style="s2">processes of ethnography to our own</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">communities based on something that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.440" end="01:11:40.080" style="s2">alluded to earlier</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m also curious to know how will is</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.080" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">generated for</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:47.600" style="s2">folks to actually do those processes</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:49.679" style="s2">okay so we i mean the thing i run is</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.600" end="01:11:52.080" style="s2">called the can having center</p>

<p begin="01:11:58.960" end="01:12:01.679" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.600" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">we have academic members not-for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.679" end="01:12:05.040" style="s2">members people like the international</p>

<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">the software for their membership fees</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.280" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">and we work together we&#39;ve got programs</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">going on climate change at the moment on</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.880" end="01:12:17.840" style="s2">the numinous</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:18.400" style="s2">so participate in those right those are</p>

<p begin="01:12:21.199" end="01:12:25.360" style="s2">and sell the software to you</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.640" end="01:12:26.960" style="s2">right um and there are things like quick</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.360" end="01:12:28.560" style="s2">starts and training so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.960" end="01:12:31.360" style="s2">where the commercial side runs</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.560" end="01:12:32.400" style="s2">yeah um but we&#39;re really open to things</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.360" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">like with</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:36.719" style="s2">yeah running that training and setting</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:37.600" style="s2">up something with the stowe we we&#39;d look</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.719" end="01:12:41.199" style="s2">at doing that</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">right um and my i&#39;ve got the freedom now</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.199" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">in my research center to do what i want</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:48.840" style="s2">to do rather than what i need to do to</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:50.960" style="s2">manage the cash flow so that&#39;s where i</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.840" end="01:12:52.320" style="s2">am</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.960" end="01:12:54.719" style="s2">yeah thank you and can you say a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.320" end="01:12:56.159" style="s2">bit about the generation of will for</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.719" end="01:12:58.480" style="s2">folks to actually follow through with</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.159" end="01:13:01.520" style="s2">the journaling exercises and such</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.480" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2">well the key thing is to there was an</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.520" end="01:13:04.640" style="s2">old rule i created on knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.800" end="01:13:06.320" style="s2">management is never ask somebody to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">something on the basis it will save them</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.320" end="01:13:09.840" style="s2">time in the future because they know</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:12.159" style="s2">you&#39;re lying</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.840" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">so what you actually have to do is to</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.159" end="01:13:15.199" style="s2">reduce the time now so</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:16.960" style="s2">if i take some of the examples what we</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.199" end="01:13:18.880" style="s2">did with the us army</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:22.480" style="s2">is we said keep a journal up to date you</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.880" end="01:13:22.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have to write a patrol report</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.640" end="01:13:26.560" style="s2">yeah we got 100 compliance on that</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.640" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">nobody wants to write a patrol report at</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.560" end="01:13:29.280" style="s2">the end of the day all right and</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:30.840" style="s2">actually the real-time data was more</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.280" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">valuable over multiple company</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.840" end="01:13:35.120" style="s2">commanders</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:37.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a lot by using children on</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.120" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">school projects so a school class</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.040" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">gets sent out to do ethnography</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:44.080" style="s2">yeah that actually satisfies</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:45.120" style="s2">baccalaureate and other educational</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.080" end="01:13:46.880" style="s2">reliance</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.120" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">requirements for community engagement to</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.880" end="01:13:50.719" style="s2">understand the statistics so teachers</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:53.520" style="s2">are behind it so it happens</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.719" end="01:13:56.560" style="s2">uh with chanel my favorite client</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.520" end="01:13:59.440" style="s2">because they stay in really nice places</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.560" end="01:14:00.080" style="s2">chanel is fun right with their top</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.440" end="01:14:01.600" style="s2">leadership</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.080" end="01:14:03.040" style="s2">group we got them to keep journals</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:04.640" style="s2">because they were on the leadership</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.040" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">development group therefore we could get</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.640" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">them to do it</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.239" end="01:14:10.000" style="s2">uh with new employees we basically say</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.719" end="01:14:11.440" style="s2">for your first few months you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.000" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">keep your journal and every week you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.440" end="01:14:14.239" style="s2">be asked to go and interview somebody</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:15.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s how we get knowledge from</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.239" end="01:14:17.840" style="s2">senior staff</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.920" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">so the key thing is to think about it as</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.840" end="01:14:22.560" style="s2">doing something which has operational</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.480" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">utility to people rather than something</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.560" end="01:14:27.520" style="s2">which is yet another survey</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:30.320" style="s2">the other thing is i mean sometimes we</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:32.719" style="s2">call this stuff engagement because</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.320" end="01:14:34.480" style="s2">if i go to a company when i&#39;m just doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.719" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">one with one of the big farmers earlier</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.480" end="01:14:36.960" style="s2">on today</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:38.960" style="s2">right and it was kind of okay so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.960" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">present your vision of the future of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.960" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">of you know this is a purpose statement</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:44.320" style="s2">god help me from purpose statements but</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:45.760" style="s2">they&#39;re prepared to pay me money so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.320" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">do it all right</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.760" end="01:14:49.280" style="s2">so we&#39;ll present the purpose statement</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:51.120" style="s2">to the whole of your staff</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.280" end="01:14:52.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll get them to tell the negative and</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.120" end="01:14:54.080" style="s2">positive story about what the statement</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.960" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">excites</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.080" end="01:14:57.679" style="s2">they&#39;ll index it and then we&#39;ll draw you</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:59.440" style="s2">a map</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.679" end="01:15:01.600" style="s2">now what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.440" end="01:15:04.239" style="s2">them in assessing the situation not</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.600" end="01:15:06.719" style="s2">surveying them</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:09.360" style="s2">right so we we do mass situational</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.719" end="01:15:11.520" style="s2">assessment and micro scenario planning</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.360" end="01:15:13.280" style="s2">so basically a ceo can consult the whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.520" end="01:15:15.280" style="s2">of their staff and get one of those maps</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:17.040" style="s2">back in 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.280" end="01:15:18.560" style="s2">and provided you give feedback to people</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.040" end="01:15:21.760" style="s2">to tell you what you do it they&#39;re then</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.560" end="01:15:23.600" style="s2">part of the part of the solution finding</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.760" end="01:15:27.120" style="s2">rather than being subject so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.600" end="01:15:27.120" style="s2">the sort of engagement side of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.760" end="01:15:32.000" style="s2">thank you very much all right so this</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.560" end="01:15:33.040" style="s2">might be the last question i&#39;ll read it</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.000" end="01:15:36.000" style="s2">on john&#39;s behalf</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.040" end="01:15:38.159" style="s2">um how did you decide which concepts to</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.000" end="01:15:40.159" style="s2">use for the corners of the triangles</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.159" end="01:15:41.679" style="s2">uh do you vary them for different</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.159" end="01:15:43.440" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.679" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">i mean academics get this one straight</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.440" end="01:15:48.719" style="s2">away the subject you&#39;re looking at you</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.679" end="01:15:50.719" style="s2">do a literature search</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.719" end="01:15:52.000" style="s2">yeah and you identify the core concepts</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.719" end="01:15:53.520" style="s2">in the literature search and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.000" end="01:15:55.360" style="s2">construct the trials from that so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.520" end="01:15:56.159" style="s2">can always authenticate the triangles</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.360" end="01:15:58.560" style="s2">back to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.159" end="01:15:59.840" style="s2">back to knowledge in the field and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.560" end="01:16:01.199" style="s2">that&#39;s how we do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.840" end="01:16:03.199" style="s2">and we have whole libraries of these</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.199" end="01:16:05.040" style="s2">things now yeah that we we should come</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.199" end="01:16:06.480" style="s2">from different backgrounds</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.040" end="01:16:08.239" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s like if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.480" end="01:16:10.239" style="s2">somebody doing longitudinal research</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.239" end="01:16:12.800" style="s2">they gather narrative they transcribe it</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.239" end="01:16:14.640" style="s2">they tag it in something like nvivo</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.800" end="01:16:16.239" style="s2">they have a theory of the field in mind</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.640" end="01:16:18.000" style="s2">when they do the tagging</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.239" end="01:16:19.760" style="s2">we take the theory of the field we</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.000" end="01:16:21.199" style="s2">translate it into triangles but then</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.760" end="01:16:23.760" style="s2">people self-tag</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.199" end="01:16:25.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s not done by the expert yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.760" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">it creates a grammar of meaning is one</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.600" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">of the ways i phrase it</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.920" end="01:16:35.120" style="s2">all right so uh we&#39;ll end here</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.199" end="01:16:36.800" style="s2">before we do i&#39;ll hand it over to dave</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.120" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">for any kind of concluding thoughts that</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.800" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">you haven&#39;t uh about the series or</p>
