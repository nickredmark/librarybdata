<p begin="00:01:44.330" end="00:01:51.710" style="s2">take a few moments to gather ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.080" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">and collect our attention together so</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.710" end="00:01:59.780" style="s2">feel free to close your eyes or</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:02:03.440" style="s2">sit still and let yourself catch up to</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.330" end="00:02:18.200" style="s2">silence together</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:21.580" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:47.620" style="s2">do today is off reuse concepts and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.150" end="00:02:50.540" style="s2">that come out of Western traditions of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.620" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">contemplation and philosophy that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.540" end="00:02:57.650" style="s2">think may aid us in navigating the times</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:03:00.470" style="s2">ahead so I&#39;ll say a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.650" end="00:03:02.930" style="s2">practice in general and then I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.470" end="00:03:05.510" style="s2">talk about a few texts namely I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.930" end="00:03:08.150" style="s2">to talk about Plato&#39;s dialogue the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.510" end="00:03:11.660" style="s2">Phaedo and I&#39;m also going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:14.390" style="s2">peer hadou and his reading of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.660" end="00:03:16.190" style="s2">as a spiritual exercise</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.390" end="00:03:19.700" style="s2">I haven&#39;t developed all of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.190" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">as much as I&#39;d like to just yet so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.700" end="00:03:23.570" style="s2">hoping that we can have a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:26.270" style="s2">discussion afterwards and maybe unfold</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.570" end="00:03:28.970" style="s2">these themes a little bit further I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.270" end="00:03:31.010" style="s2">also post a list of the texts I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.970" end="00:03:34.940" style="s2">in the talk if anyone wants to follow up</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.010" end="00:03:37.160" style="s2">on them later but as a sort of preamble</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.940" end="00:03:40.430" style="s2">to this discussion I was recently</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.160" end="00:03:43.370" style="s2">reminded of a passage in Thomas mertens</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.430" end="00:03:46.160" style="s2">book contemplative prayer which I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.370" end="00:03:48.380" style="s2">might help us orient orient ourselves a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.160" end="00:03:50.180" style="s2">little bit before we begin he he makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.380" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">this really helpful distinction in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.180" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">text between what he calls a charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:04:00.530" style="s2">monastic spirit and an institutional</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">monastic spirit the institutional spirit</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.530" end="00:04:06.830" style="s2">is driven by like structures and history</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:09.650" style="s2">and rules and it&#39;s more authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.830" end="00:04:13.100" style="s2">and it&#39;s a little bit rigid and it&#39;s has</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.650" end="00:04:16.040" style="s2">a kind of ascetic nature to it but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.100" end="00:04:18.970" style="s2">charismatic spirit he says is is rooted</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.040" end="00:04:22.640" style="s2">more in in compassion and care and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.970" end="00:04:26.060" style="s2">prayer but it also has this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.640" end="00:04:29.000" style="s2">quality of operating outside of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.060" end="00:04:31.550" style="s2">monasteries and institutions it has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.000" end="00:04:35.240" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s more of like a this worldly</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.550" end="00:04:38.470" style="s2">kind of practice and Merton is is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.240" end="00:04:40.790" style="s2">really clear that both types of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.470" end="00:04:43.130" style="s2">monasticism are really important you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.790" end="00:04:45.169" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t do too much with without</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.130" end="00:04:48.110" style="s2">one or the other but he says that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.169" end="00:04:50.710" style="s2">the charismatic type is unusual in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.110" end="00:04:53.720" style="s2">it flourishes in what he calls offbeat</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.710" end="00:04:57.320" style="s2">situations and so this is a spear</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.720" end="00:05:00.110" style="s2">that grows out of people who may not</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.320" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">even have explicit monastic connections</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.110" end="00:05:07.550" style="s2">at all so I kind of feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:09.320" style="s2">living in one of these offbeat</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.550" end="00:05:12.680" style="s2">situations right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.320" end="00:05:15.740" style="s2">and so mertens invocation of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.680" end="00:05:19.730" style="s2">of offbeat monasticism felt like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:21.470" style="s2">right attitude to adopt both in my life</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.730" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">and practice right now but also in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.470" end="00:05:26.420" style="s2">in this kind of discussion right this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:29.420" style="s2">a very unusual kind of virtual campfire</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.420" end="00:05:33.410" style="s2">gathering sort of talk on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.420" end="00:05:36.950" style="s2">here so I&#39;ve been feeling a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.410" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">like an offbeat monastic and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.950" end="00:05:41.780" style="s2">feeling like we all might be off mate</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:43.160" style="s2">might be offbeat monastics for for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.780" end="00:05:47.750" style="s2">little bit for a little while longer</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.160" end="00:05:50.570" style="s2">here so I just I liked that framing for</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.750" end="00:05:52.790" style="s2">the talk in general but when I talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.570" end="00:05:55.880" style="s2">about philosophical and contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.790" end="00:05:59.690" style="s2">practice I often use this word askesis</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.880" end="00:06:02.540" style="s2">which just means exercise or training to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.690" end="00:06:04.700" style="s2">describe a process where we undergo some</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.540" end="00:06:07.880" style="s2">kind of change in our being some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.700" end="00:06:12.860" style="s2">transformation and especially a change</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.880" end="00:06:14.990" style="s2">in our perception and so askesis is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.860" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">route of words like ascetic or</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.990" end="00:06:20.180" style="s2">asceticism and so when you think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:22.570" style="s2">ascetic practice you might think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.180" end="00:06:25.790" style="s2">things like fasting or celibacy</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.570" end="00:06:28.220" style="s2">physically and during trials or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.790" end="00:06:30.650" style="s2">maybe this image of a monk living in</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.220" end="00:06:33.620" style="s2">isolation but it also includes things</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.650" end="00:06:37.370" style="s2">like meditation and prayer practices of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.620" end="00:06:39.620" style="s2">care and caring visionary experiences so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.370" end="00:06:41.720" style="s2">either sort of contemplative visionary</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.620" end="00:06:44.630" style="s2">experiences or psychedelic visionary</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.720" end="00:06:47.270" style="s2">experiences or also just like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.630" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">examinations of conscience like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.270" end="00:06:54.410" style="s2">daily rituals of examination and and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:06:56.419" style="s2">practice what connects all of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.410" end="00:06:58.310" style="s2">different practices though is that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.419" end="00:07:01.250" style="s2">they have this function of working on</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.310" end="00:07:04.039" style="s2">our inner and outer senses and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.250" end="00:07:07.160" style="s2">modify them right and on one level they</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.039" end="00:07:10.010" style="s2">they change the physical senses or our</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.160" end="00:07:12.530" style="s2">senses of touch smell sight sound things</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.010" end="00:07:13.910" style="s2">like that but on another and probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.530" end="00:07:17.000" style="s2">even more important one these are</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.910" end="00:07:19.610" style="s2">practices that change our moral</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.000" end="00:07:22.520" style="s2">sensibilities and intuitions our</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.610" end="00:07:25.760" style="s2">intellectual vision of things our sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.520" end="00:07:27.800" style="s2">of spirit and the spiritual and our</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.760" end="00:07:29.240" style="s2">psychological maturity as people so</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.800" end="00:07:32.680" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of like developmental</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.240" end="00:07:32.680" style="s2">exercises in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.840" end="00:07:38.480" style="s2">and so when we look at perception from</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.480" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">the perspective of practice we can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.480" end="00:07:42.949" style="s2">that there&#39;s a kind of a deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:45.620" style="s2">between our moral and our spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.949" end="00:07:48.320" style="s2">lives and our epistemology or our</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.620" end="00:07:50.030" style="s2">ability to know things and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.320" end="00:07:54.530" style="s2">want to mark that connection between</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.030" end="00:07:56.210" style="s2">between practice and knowing just as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.530" end="00:07:58.810" style="s2">theme that I&#39;m going to come back to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.210" end="00:08:00.880" style="s2">little bit later on</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.810" end="00:08:04.450" style="s2">but for now I want to focus on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.880" end="00:08:09.700" style="s2">particular practice it&#39;s a practice that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.450" end="00:08:12.130" style="s2">we find in Plato&#39;s texts the Phaedo and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.700" end="00:08:15.550" style="s2">it has to do with a certain reading of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.130" end="00:08:19.720" style="s2">philosophy as a preparation for death</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.550" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">as many of you may know the dialogue the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.720" end="00:08:25.000" style="s2">Phaedo famously recounts the last hours</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:27.490" style="s2">of Socrates his life before his own</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.000" end="00:08:31.620" style="s2">death and so just to set the scene a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.490" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">little bit this the dialogue starts out</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.620" end="00:08:38.070" style="s2">fado is talking he&#39;s narrating these</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:41.649" style="s2">last moments and this is just after</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.070" end="00:08:44.050" style="s2">socrates has been sentenced to death for</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.649" end="00:08:47.380" style="s2">impiety and for corrupting the youth of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.050" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">Athens essentially for refusing belief</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.380" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">in the official gods the gods of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:56.200" style="s2">state in these last moments he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:58.270" style="s2">surrounded by friends it&#39;s a very kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.200" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">of tender scene and there but there also</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.270" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">it kind of still engaged in these deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:05.079" style="s2">philosophical discussions about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:07.570" style="s2">nature of life and death death and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.079" end="00:09:10.899" style="s2">rebirth what is the true aim of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.570" end="00:09:14.260" style="s2">philosophy the relationship between time</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.899" end="00:09:17.380" style="s2">and change and eternity and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.260" end="00:09:19.480" style="s2">other sort of rich topics like this but</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.380" end="00:09:23.880" style="s2">I wanted to read just a short excerpt</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.480" end="00:09:27.459" style="s2">from the dialogue and this scene is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.880" end="00:09:30.220" style="s2">again fado just kind of giving his</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.459" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">narration of Socrates in these last</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.220" end="00:09:35.890" style="s2">hours and this is how fado describes</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:38.380" style="s2">socrates and this this kind of sets up</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.890" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">the the attitude that I want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.380" end="00:09:45.610" style="s2">and so here&#39;s fado he says I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:48.730" style="s2">found being there an astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.610" end="00:09:52.029" style="s2">experience although I was witnessing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.730" end="00:09:54.010" style="s2">death of one who was my friend I had no</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.029" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">feeling of pity for the man appeared</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.010" end="00:10:01.750" style="s2">happy in both manner and words as he</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:03.430" style="s2">died nobly and without fear it struck me</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.750" end="00:10:06.850" style="s2">that even in going down to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.430" end="00:10:09.850" style="s2">underworld he was going down with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.850" end="00:10:14.490" style="s2">God&#39;s blessing and that he would fare</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.850" end="00:10:14.490" style="s2">well when he got there if anyone does</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.790" end="00:10:20.040" style="s2">had no feeling of pity such as would</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.220" end="00:10:23.730" style="s2">seem natural in my sorrow nor indeed of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.040" end="00:10:25.560" style="s2">pleasure as we engaged in philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.730" end="00:10:29.070" style="s2">discussions as we were accustomed to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.560" end="00:10:32.040" style="s2">for our arguments were of that sort but</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.070" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">I had a strange feeling an unaccustomed</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.040" end="00:10:37.260" style="s2">mixture of pleasure and pain at the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:42.630" style="s2">time as I reflected that he was about to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.260" end="00:10:45.540" style="s2">die so this image</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.630" end="00:10:48.660" style="s2">of Socrates going to his death nobly</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.540" end="00:10:50.790" style="s2">without fear seemingly unperturbed he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.660" end="00:10:53.070" style="s2">almost casual about the whole thing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.790" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">this is the kind of mood that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.070" end="00:10:57.900" style="s2">focus on and just ask kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:59.280" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here how did how did how</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.900" end="00:11:02.070" style="s2">did he get to this place</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.280" end="00:11:07.080" style="s2">how did Socrates become this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.070" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">person and I think elsewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.080" end="00:11:11.460" style="s2">dialogue he has a he has a very famous</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:14.100" style="s2">passage that I&#39;m also going to share</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.460" end="00:11:17.190" style="s2">with you in a second that that I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.100" end="00:11:19.800" style="s2">gives you some hints into how Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.190" end="00:11:21.570" style="s2">is able to approach his own death with</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.800" end="00:11:24.350" style="s2">this kind of equanimity with this kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.570" end="00:11:28.290" style="s2">of balance and so in this famous passage</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.350" end="00:11:31.500" style="s2">Socrates himself says I am afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.290" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">other people do not realize that the one</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.500" end="00:11:37.560" style="s2">aim of those who practice philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:41.670" style="s2">the proper manner is to practice for</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.560" end="00:11:43.980" style="s2">death and dying and so I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.670" end="00:11:45.970" style="s2">find some answers to these questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.980" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.970" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">the simple line is that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:52.509" style="s2">approaches his death the way he does</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:11:55.269" style="s2">because of the way he practices</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.509" end="00:11:58.360" style="s2">philosophy and so I think it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.269" end="00:12:00.279" style="s2">putting a bit of a microscope on what</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.360" end="00:12:02.470" style="s2">are these practices exactly what is he</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.279" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">what is he doing how did how did at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.470" end="00:12:08.500" style="s2">end of his life how did he reach this</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:09.910" style="s2">place and so I want to look at some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.500" end="00:12:12.819" style="s2">those practices a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.910" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">specifically but I also want to call</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.819" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">attention again to our context right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:21.129" style="s2">just to point out I&#39;m always at pain</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:23.230" style="s2">pains to point out that when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.129" end="00:12:25.449" style="s2">talking about these practices we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.230" end="00:12:28.149" style="s2">putting them into words and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.449" end="00:12:31.949" style="s2">practices themselves aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.149" end="00:12:34.529" style="s2">about the words and it&#39;s really easy to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.949" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">especially innocent setting like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.529" end="00:12:39.220" style="s2">move into a place where we we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:42.490" style="s2">replace practice with this whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.220" end="00:12:43.870" style="s2">discourse about practice so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.490" end="00:12:47.110" style="s2">give you a little discourse about</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.870" end="00:12:50.759" style="s2">practice whilst keeping in mind that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.110" end="00:12:54.879" style="s2">practice is actually what matters so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.759" end="00:12:59.110" style="s2">this phrase practices for death and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.879" end="00:13:01.660" style="s2">dying that Socrates uses it&#39;s its own</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.110" end="00:13:05.259" style="s2">whole genre of askesis or ascetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.660" end="00:13:09.699" style="s2">practice and it falls within a group of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.259" end="00:13:15.420" style="s2">practices that philosophers called</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.699" end="00:13:18.850" style="s2">Mellet a Thanatos Mellet a finito and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.420" end="00:13:23.410" style="s2">Mellet a just means to study or to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.850" end="00:13:27.160" style="s2">meditate and the modern term meditation</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.410" end="00:13:29.949" style="s2">is actually a Latin translation of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.160" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">Greek word Mela Tate</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.949" end="00:13:36.519" style="s2">Thanet Oh some of you may know just</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">means death or to die or to be dying</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.519" end="00:13:43.790" style="s2">so Mellet a Thanatos means</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:47.100" style="s2">meditations on death</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.790" end="00:13:50.249" style="s2">now these practices aren&#39;t all as</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.100" end="00:13:52.920" style="s2">literal as they sound and instead they</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.249" end="00:13:55.259" style="s2">circle several different kinds of death</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.920" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">that include physical death but also</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.259" end="00:14:01.949" style="s2">include all kinds of other notions of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:04.170" style="s2">death and so one place where I go to to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.949" end="00:14:06.920" style="s2">kind of unpack these practices is peer</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.170" end="00:14:06.920" style="s2">Hodos work</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.870" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">and if you haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.769" end="00:14:16.119" style="s2">ago and if you&#39;re interested in practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.290" end="00:14:19.480" style="s2">and contemplation and things like that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.119" end="00:14:21.309" style="s2">really recommend that you pick up he has</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.480" end="00:14:24.309" style="s2">one book called what is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.309" end="00:14:26.379" style="s2">philosophy and another one which is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.309" end="00:14:29.670" style="s2">collection of essays called philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.379" end="00:14:33.759" style="s2">as a way of life and these are just</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.670" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">fantastic studies in philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.759" end="00:14:42.519" style="s2">practice philosophy as spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:45.009" style="s2">exercise as he says so hadou picks up</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.519" end="00:14:48.009" style="s2">the theme of melet a finito</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.009" end="00:14:49.660" style="s2">and I&#39;ll focus just on the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.009" end="00:14:50.949" style="s2">tradition just because that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.660" end="00:14:53.980" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been talking about in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.949" end="00:14:58.029" style="s2">Phaedo so there we saw it already with</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.980" end="00:15:01.739" style="s2">fade owes description of Socrates actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.029" end="00:15:03.879" style="s2">death so in the scene just prior to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.739" end="00:15:07.569" style="s2">Socrates dying</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.879" end="00:15:11.439" style="s2">fado talks about how Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.569" end="00:15:13.480" style="s2">actually washing his own his body he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.439" end="00:15:17.769" style="s2">bathing his body he&#39;s cleaning himself</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.480" end="00:15:20.110" style="s2">and this is something that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.769" end="00:15:22.329" style="s2">the people working working as</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.110" end="00:15:24.009" style="s2">executioner&#39;s and and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.329" end="00:15:26.759" style="s2">would have to do after the execution</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.009" end="00:15:29.079" style="s2">they would they would clean the body and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.759" end="00:15:30.879" style="s2">Socrates is taking that upon himself</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.079" end="00:15:33.339" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t want anybody else to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.879" end="00:15:35.649" style="s2">have to do it for him when he&#39;s dead so</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.339" end="00:15:37.660" style="s2">he has this kind of this is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.649" end="00:15:39.850" style="s2">strange calmness about the whole thing</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.570" end="00:16:53.380" style="s2">start I I also equate to a kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:16:53.380" end="00:16:57.820" style="s2">experience and what these practices all</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.020" end="00:17:00.730" style="s2">have in common is that they kind of ad</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.820" end="00:17:02.920" style="s2">Center the individual person or they</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.730" end="00:17:06.010" style="s2">kind of strip it away almost leading to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.920" end="00:17:08.770" style="s2">its death so that the the ego identities</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.010" end="00:17:10.510" style="s2">kind of pulled apart and so death in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.770" end="00:17:12.760" style="s2">this sense can be a literal death but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.510" end="00:17:15.970" style="s2">can also be this kind of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.760" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">or visionary or spiritual death but what</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.970" end="00:17:20.530" style="s2">in in every case you get this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:24.600" style="s2">liberation of the soul from the small</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.530" end="00:17:27.820" style="s2">self or the small ego so for hadou</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.600" end="00:17:30.700" style="s2">philosophy then is this kind of learning</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.820" end="00:17:34.090" style="s2">to die it&#39;s a learning to die through</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.700" end="00:17:36.370" style="s2">these spiritual exercises and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.090" end="00:17:39.340" style="s2">describes these exercises as a kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.360" end="00:17:59.380" style="s2">forth and so this is this is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.680" end="00:18:02.890" style="s2">image of philosophy practiced rightly</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.380" end="00:18:05.350" style="s2">that that Socrates is aiming at but of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.890" end="00:18:07.900" style="s2">course in our contemporary scene when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.350" end="00:18:12.490" style="s2">think of philosophy it&#39;s easy to think</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.900" end="00:18:15.400" style="s2">of this sort of academic scholastic</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.490" end="00:18:18.130" style="s2">exercise that&#39;s it&#39;s all it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.400" end="00:18:21.370" style="s2">about concepts and discourse and reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.130" end="00:18:22.870" style="s2">and arguments and logic things of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.370" end="00:18:24.460" style="s2">nature and of course it is all of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.870" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">things those things are all an important</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.460" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">part of philosophy but philosophy in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">sense that we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:36.710" style="s2">can&#39;t be reduced to questions about</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:38.809" style="s2">knowledge or knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.710" end="00:18:41.419" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this other famous</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.809" end="00:18:44.630" style="s2">philosophical injunction to know thyself</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.419" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">right probably most people have heard</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.630" end="00:18:49.820" style="s2">this phrase know thyself know dee tseio</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:52.340" style="s2">Tong</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.820" end="00:18:55.610" style="s2">and in another famous dialogue the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.340" end="00:18:57.590" style="s2">apology Socrates is said to be wise</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.610" end="00:19:00.380" style="s2">because he&#39;s the one who knows he isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.590" end="00:19:03.290" style="s2">wise and so in that dialogue he says I</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.380" end="00:19:05.870" style="s2">do not think I know what I do not know</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.290" end="00:19:08.390" style="s2">and so even though he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.870" end="00:19:10.130" style="s2">affirming his lack of knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.390" end="00:19:13.880" style="s2">fulcrum is still knowledge right</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.130" end="00:19:15.290" style="s2">knowledge knowing versus not knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.880" end="00:19:17.420" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the image that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.290" end="00:19:20.090" style="s2">inherited of philosophies that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.420" end="00:19:23.060" style="s2">about knowledge but in this text the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.090" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">Phaedo knowledge isn&#39;t necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.060" end="00:19:27.050" style="s2">most important fact about philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">this is the other thing that Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.050" end="00:19:32.780" style="s2">trying to say is quote about practicing</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:35.870" style="s2">it correctly and so in the Phaedo and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.780" end="00:19:40.970" style="s2">other dialogues the really important</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.870" end="00:19:43.780" style="s2">thing is caring caring for yourself not</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.970" end="00:19:49.040" style="s2">knowing yourself but caring for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.780" end="00:19:50.990" style="s2">at Pamelia Hayato Socrates even goes so</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.040" end="00:19:53.090" style="s2">far as to say that those who don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.990" end="00:19:53.870" style="s2">for their own souls are in terrible</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.090" end="00:19:56.930" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.870" end="00:19:59.090" style="s2">and so that if you neglect yourself if</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.930" end="00:20:02.090" style="s2">you don&#39;t care for your own soul you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.090" end="00:20:04.550" style="s2">won&#39;t accomplish anything you can&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.090" end="00:20:06.110" style="s2">the philosophical life and you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.550" end="00:20:09.140" style="s2">can&#39;t gain the kinds of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.110" end="00:20:12.050" style="s2">insights that you&#39;re probably after as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.140" end="00:20:15.050" style="s2">philosopher you&#39;re you&#39;re in pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.050" end="00:20:18.670" style="s2">wisdom you&#39;re a lover of wisdom and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.050" end="00:20:22.010" style="s2">means care that means knowledge and care</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.670" end="00:20:24.710" style="s2">so from the perspective of practice this</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.010" end="00:20:27.590" style="s2">this phrase know thyself has to be met</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.710" end="00:20:30.530" style="s2">with this equally important phrase care</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.590" end="00:20:32.930" style="s2">for thyself and this is what I think s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.530" end="00:20:36.820" style="s2">qisas especially when aimed at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.930" end="00:20:39.230" style="s2">question and mystery of death suggests</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.820" end="00:20:42.950" style="s2">practice is a kind of it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.230" end="00:20:45.980" style="s2">knowing caring like a knowing - caring</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.950" end="00:20:48.530" style="s2">or it&#39;s like a caring that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.980" end="00:20:51.350" style="s2">knowing or a knowing that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.530" end="00:20:54.200" style="s2">caring simultaneously to know is to care</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.350" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">to care is to know and all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.200" end="00:20:58.490" style="s2">done in service of death which was</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:01.400" style="s2">viewed in this light as is a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.490" end="00:21:02.840" style="s2">falling away as a revealing as an</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.400" end="00:21:06.680" style="s2">opportunity for seeing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.840" end="00:21:09.530" style="s2">through a new kind of being so I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.680" end="00:21:12.170" style="s2">then that the practice of death as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.530" end="00:21:16.280" style="s2">kind of meditative exercise aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.170" end="00:21:19.130" style="s2">conversion transformation preparation is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.280" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">at bottom a kind of caring it&#39;s a mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.130" end="00:21:24.380" style="s2">of caring attention a caring and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:27.140" style="s2">deliberate attention aimed at the self</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.380" end="00:21:29.030" style="s2">but also at the other we take care of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.140" end="00:21:30.800" style="s2">ourselves so that we can take care of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.030" end="00:21:32.420" style="s2">others and we try to learn about</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.800" end="00:21:34.490" style="s2">ourselves so we can better take care of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.420" end="00:21:37.160" style="s2">ourselves we try to learn about other</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.490" end="00:21:40.550" style="s2">people so we can get we better take care</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.160" end="00:21:41.930" style="s2">of them so these practices are</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.550" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">philosophical practices our</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.930" end="00:21:46.040" style="s2">contemplative practices really if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:48.680" style="s2">doing them in the way that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.040" end="00:21:52.130" style="s2">suggests in this dialogue they&#39;re geared</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.680" end="00:21:54.580" style="s2">towards training for preparation for</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.130" end="00:21:57.260" style="s2">these moments of catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.580" end="00:22:00.200" style="s2">transformation death rebirth falling</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.260" end="00:22:03.320" style="s2">away and then being ready for these</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.200" end="00:22:05.390" style="s2">moments is then one meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.320" end="00:22:07.970" style="s2">practicing philosophy in the proper way</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.390" end="00:22:10.280" style="s2">so that when such events arise our</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:11.960" style="s2">training comes into play so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.280" end="00:22:14.020" style="s2">something like philosophical or</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.960" end="00:22:17.390" style="s2">contemplative athletes were people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.020" end="00:22:23.240" style="s2">maintain our sense of care and lucidity</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.390" end="00:22:23.510" style="s2">even in these times of death so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.240" end="00:22:26.030" style="s2">what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.510" end="00:22:29.750" style="s2">wanted to say there&#39;s a lot more that I</p>

<p begin="00:22:52.730" end="00:22:58.790" style="s2">this&#39;ll be a high level one Zach Stein</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.150" end="00:23:00.350" style="s2">was in the store earlier today he was</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.790" end="00:23:03.020" style="s2">talking about how we are in this liminal</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.350" end="00:23:06.200" style="s2">state he was talking about that article</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.020" end="00:23:07.730" style="s2">that he recently wrote for a merge and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.200" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">sort of in the state there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.730" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">like we&#39;re seeing kind of different</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:13.700" style="s2">narratives kind of competing right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:15.350" style="s2">like you know we need to go forward to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.700" end="00:23:20.120" style="s2">something better or we need to go back</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.350" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">to what was normal and when</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.120" end="00:23:25.070" style="s2">situation started occurring this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.840" style="s2">or meta-crisis like usually I don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.070" end="00:23:28.670" style="s2">much about my stoicism like them kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.840" end="00:23:30.380" style="s2">like a closet stoic most of the time but</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.670" end="00:23:32.030" style="s2">it really just came online and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.380" end="00:23:33.950" style="s2">okay I had to really kind of um you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.030" end="00:23:37.610" style="s2">you know turn this to turn this part on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.950" end="00:23:40.670" style="s2">and it felt really important to do so so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.610" end="00:23:43.610" style="s2">the question for you is in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.670" end="00:23:45.770" style="s2">liminal state that we&#39;re in what do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.610" end="00:23:50.270" style="s2">think the role of philosophy is going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.770" end="00:23:55.790" style="s2">be or should be and specifically the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.270" end="00:23:57.500" style="s2">practice of death well I I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.790" end="00:24:00.680" style="s2">philosophy has a lot of different modes</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.500" end="00:24:03.380" style="s2">obviously and I&#39;m kind of zeroing in on</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.680" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">one and it&#39;s it&#39;s the one that I&#39;m drawn</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.380" end="00:24:10.130" style="s2">to as a person in any situation but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:13.670" style="s2">also the one that I think is is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.130" end="00:24:16.660" style="s2">right now and so this this this idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.670" end="00:24:20.560" style="s2">that we&#39;re in training we&#39;re practicing</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.660" end="00:24:23.090" style="s2">we&#39;re athletes of a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.560" end="00:24:25.040" style="s2">certain kind of contemplative athlete or</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.090" end="00:24:27.500" style="s2">something like that the whole idea there</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.040" end="00:24:30.380" style="s2">is that you you&#39;ll be response sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.500" end="00:24:31.850" style="s2">response able in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.380" end="00:24:35.810" style="s2">situation that you can&#39;t predict that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.850" end="00:24:37.700" style="s2">you can&#39;t know the idea that we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.810" end="00:24:40.280" style="s2">build some kind of a system that will</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.700" end="00:24:42.230" style="s2">predict what next week will look like</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.280" end="00:24:45.620" style="s2">what next month will look like what next</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.230" end="00:24:47.950" style="s2">year will look like seems right now more</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.620" end="00:24:50.180" style="s2">unlikely than ever you know its</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.950" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">prediction is a hard business anyway</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.180" end="00:24:54.920" style="s2">system is a hard business anyway but</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.100" end="00:24:57.500" style="s2">right now having that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.920" end="00:25:00.950" style="s2">flexibility having that kind of ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.500" end="00:25:02.530" style="s2">to navigate the unknown without needing</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.950" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">to know what&#39;s about to come</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.530" end="00:25:07.730" style="s2">seems to be like the most important</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:11.720" style="s2">thing so these these practices</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.730" end="00:25:13.850" style="s2">meditative practices it they ready you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.720" end="00:25:16.630" style="s2">for unknown things and so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.850" end="00:25:20.290" style="s2">kind of how I really do</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.630" end="00:25:22.420" style="s2">and the other question I had Massimo</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.290" end="00:25:24.010" style="s2">Pigliucci you know the popular stoic he</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.420" end="00:25:26.410" style="s2">was one of the first guests here in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.010" end="00:25:28.840" style="s2">stoah he said something in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.410" end="00:25:31.090" style="s2">retrospect I didn&#39;t like that much</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.840" end="00:25:31.930" style="s2">he&#39;s the whole you know the arena</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.090" end="00:25:34.630" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.930" end="00:25:37.420" style="s2">you know the athlete metaphor in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.630" end="00:25:39.010" style="s2">binos doses and like straining and he</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.420" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">kind of said oh yeah it&#39;s too late now</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.010" end="00:25:42.670" style="s2">though we&#39;re in the arena you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:43.900" style="s2">too late to practice for it right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.670" end="00:25:45.130" style="s2">people are gonna be turned to things</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.900" end="00:25:47.110" style="s2">like stoicism her philosophy in these</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.130" end="00:25:49.210" style="s2">times I don&#39;t think we should push them</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.110" end="00:25:53.680" style="s2">away I wanted to throw that to you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.210" end="00:25:58.300" style="s2">see what you think yeah I mean not to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.680" end="00:26:02.980" style="s2">start beef with you Massimo exchanged</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.300" end="00:26:04.630" style="s2">some messages before I mean to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.980" end="00:26:06.130" style="s2">degree I think the sense of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.630" end="00:26:10.270" style="s2">saying there&#39;s something to the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.130" end="00:26:11.950" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying that if things are</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.270" end="00:26:14.260" style="s2">happening you know and so if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.950" end="00:26:18.070" style="s2">already been practicing that would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.260" end="00:26:22.570" style="s2">better but it&#39;s never too late to start</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.070" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">practicing so I don&#39;t really agree with</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.570" end="00:26:26.170" style="s2">the idea that you you couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">something out of it right now I think if</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.170" end="00:26:33.010" style="s2">you just abstract lis just like day one</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;d be a great great moment to start</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.010" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:44.270" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m on Team practice right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.659" end="00:26:47.710" style="s2">as well so Michael I&#39;m going to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.270" end="00:26:47.710" style="s2">you if you can reach your question</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.940" end="00:26:55.820" style="s2">you&#39;re unmuted Michael okay thanks Peter</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.340" end="00:26:59.210" style="s2">so Adam I just wanted them you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.820" end="00:27:02.690" style="s2">of give us an example of your daily</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.210" end="00:27:05.539" style="s2">practices of askesis and kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.690" end="00:27:07.100" style="s2">that looks like just so that we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.539" end="00:27:10.039" style="s2">of take something away that we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.100" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">actually am implement in our daily lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.039" end="00:27:15.860" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:20.510" style="s2">well you know I think the main easy one</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.860" end="00:27:22.549" style="s2">is to just get yourself into just a rig</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.510" end="00:27:25.100" style="s2">getting practice just a meditative</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.549" end="00:27:27.580" style="s2">practice kind of how you know we opened</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.100" end="00:27:31.220" style="s2">up just with a minute or two of silence</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.580" end="00:27:35.720" style="s2">and just kind of be be with yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:38.630" style="s2">the silence and I&#39;ve learned to let that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.720" end="00:27:42.679" style="s2">silence be its own kind of teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.630" end="00:27:45.649" style="s2">to pay attention to what emerges in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.679" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">silence and so not to come into it with</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.649" end="00:27:52.549" style="s2">a lot of expectations and and things</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:56.390" style="s2">like that but to just just let let that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.549" end="00:27:58.549" style="s2">intuitive side of yourself speak and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.390" end="00:28:00.830" style="s2">you know listen to it and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.549" end="00:28:04.340" style="s2">one thing that&#39;s been really helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.830" end="00:28:06.649" style="s2">me especially in these past few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.340" end="00:28:08.840" style="s2">but then there&#39;s other things you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.649" end="00:28:11.299" style="s2">like the the practices that we started</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.840" end="00:28:13.010" style="s2">about like I think I think if meditation</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.299" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">is difficult for you if the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.010" end="00:28:17.690" style="s2">philosophical texts aren&#39;t really your</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:20.510" style="s2">thing then like like I found like</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.690" end="00:28:24.770" style="s2">fasting to be like a really helpful tool</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.510" end="00:28:27.110" style="s2">to like clarify thoughts and emotions so</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.770" end="00:28:29.020" style="s2">that&#39;s another one that I do you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.110" end="00:28:32.299" style="s2">when we can go out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.020" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">martial arts has been a big practice for</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.299" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">me so I think I think the number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:39.590" style="s2">practices are they are pretty diverse</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s like I said it&#39;s hard to put</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.590" end="00:28:44.809" style="s2">them into words in a setting like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.120" end="00:28:47.870" style="s2">and just have them kind of land but fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.809" end="00:28:50.570" style="s2">that kind of just like just a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.870" end="00:28:53.950" style="s2">a kind of a practice of Merton calls a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.570" end="00:28:56.540" style="s2">contemplative prayer or mindfulness or</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.950" end="00:29:00.020" style="s2">you know just a regular sitting</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.540" end="00:29:01.550" style="s2">meditation and following where that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.020" end="00:29:08.540" style="s2">thread kind of takes you would be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.550" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">best right now cool okay let&#39;s go with</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.540" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">Richard tarnis I&#39;m going to unmute you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.350" end="00:29:23.900" style="s2">hey hey I just unmuted myself if that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">helps thanks Peter and thank thank you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.900" end="00:29:32.420" style="s2">so much Adam for your your timely</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">thoughts so I was just asking you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.420" end="00:29:35.990" style="s2">you focused on Socrates this very</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:38.420" style="s2">well-known</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.990" end="00:29:40.660" style="s2">cheerful equilibrium as he faced his</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.420" end="00:29:43.160" style="s2">death and you also brought up</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.660" end="00:29:45.860" style="s2">philosophical meditative experiences</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.160" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">that in some way resemble psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.860" end="00:29:51.050" style="s2">experiences and I was wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">found any if in thinking about this you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.050" end="00:29:55.790" style="s2">see any connection between Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:57.710" style="s2">attitudes and and the widespread</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.790" end="00:30:00.620" style="s2">participation and the Eleusinian</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.710" end="00:30:04.520" style="s2">mysteries in Athens at that time as they</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.620" end="00:30:06.140" style="s2">used some kind of cycle after drink and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.520" end="00:30:10.550" style="s2">of course we know how you know the many</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.140" end="00:30:13.400" style="s2">people who have psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.550" end="00:30:15.650" style="s2">undergo a really radical transformation</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.400" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">in their view of death and often will</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.650" end="00:30:20.540" style="s2">overcome that fear of death that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.610" style="s2">had previously been affected by though</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.540" end="00:30:24.230" style="s2">often unconsciously I just wondered if</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.610" end="00:30:27.400" style="s2">you had any thoughts not not that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.230" end="00:30:33.740" style="s2">asking you to I don&#39;t know reduce</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.400" end="00:30:38.390" style="s2">Socrates&#39;s you know mmm equilibrium and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.740" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">and kind of philosophical contribution</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.390" end="00:30:47.780" style="s2">to to the Eleusinian mysteries but just</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:49.220" style="s2">whether you see any connection there at</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.780" end="00:30:53.630" style="s2">all or hadn&#39;t thought about that at all</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.220" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">yeah I thought about it quite a bit I</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.630" end="00:30:59.780" style="s2">know others like Michael Pollan digs</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:02.210" style="s2">into the scholarship a little bit in his</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.780" end="00:31:05.510" style="s2">his newest book on psychedelics and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.210" end="00:31:07.580" style="s2">think I think his name is bill Richards</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.510" end="00:31:09.789" style="s2">has a book called sacred knowledge where</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.580" end="00:31:13.610" style="s2">he kind of they but they&#39;re both kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.789" end="00:31:18.100" style="s2">examining the evidence for psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.610" end="00:31:20.600" style="s2">use in the Ellison Ian mystery writes</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.100" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">mostly in a beverage called Chi kyun</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.600" end="00:31:24.980" style="s2">right which isn&#39;t kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:27.260" style="s2">psychedelic sounds like almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.980" end="00:31:31.970" style="s2">kind of a psychedelic beer like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.260" end="00:31:34.549" style="s2">real it&#39;s some kind of a brew I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.970" end="00:31:38.150" style="s2">that the the connections are there I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.549" end="00:31:40.700" style="s2">think that even some of the scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.150" end="00:31:42.470" style="s2">points in that direction I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.700" end="00:31:45.169" style="s2">that&#39;s the I don&#39;t think that&#39;s yet the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.470" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">mainstream view and like this historical</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.169" end="00:31:50.600" style="s2">scholarship I find it convincing but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">also find it convincing because once</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.600" end="00:31:55.970" style="s2">you&#39;re on the other side of those other</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">psychedelic experiences a dialogue like</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.970" end="00:32:00.200" style="s2">the Phaedo just makes a lot more sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:02.659" style="s2">and some of the things that they talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.200" end="00:32:04.580" style="s2">about in terms of a recollection or</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.659" end="00:32:07.580" style="s2">anamnesis and things like that may just</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.580" end="00:32:09.080" style="s2">make a lot more sense and so I I I have</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.580" end="00:32:12.140" style="s2">a hard time I think you could probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.080" end="00:32:16.460" style="s2">you probably can get into those spaces</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.140" end="00:32:18.890" style="s2">without the psychedelic use but at this</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.460" end="00:32:21.710" style="s2">point I would be extremely surprised to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.890" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">learn that this the psychedelic use</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.710" end="00:32:28.460" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a part of Socrates initiation</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:31.490" style="s2">into these ideas and perspectives they</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.460" end="00:32:33.700" style="s2">certainly have been for me and I bet</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.490" end="00:32:35.289" style="s2">they were for him too</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.700" end="00:32:43.479" style="s2">thanks that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.289" end="00:32:48.979" style="s2">very much money my thoughts as well cool</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.479" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">key you had a question if you can unmute</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.979" end="00:33:00.979" style="s2">yourself yeah hello can you hear me</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:33:02.950" style="s2">yep Thank You Adam for speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.979" end="00:33:06.229" style="s2">your both your experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.950" end="00:33:11.690" style="s2">different types of practices that can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.229" end="00:33:16.330" style="s2">done to understand a bit better the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.690" end="00:33:20.059" style="s2">process of death and dying in how</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.330" end="00:33:24.229" style="s2">Socrates experienced it this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.059" end="00:33:28.039" style="s2">definitely i&#39;m also very new to stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.229" end="00:33:32.929" style="s2">so hearing from your perspective helped</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.039" end="00:33:36.710" style="s2">me understand more about the well the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.929" end="00:33:40.429" style="s2">the texts for sure my question revolves</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.710" end="00:33:43.729" style="s2">around when you talked about si knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.429" end="00:33:47.210" style="s2">yourself and know thyself and then when</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.729" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">you related it to caring for thyself and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.210" end="00:33:56.599" style="s2">them knowing caring dichotomy I guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:58.969" style="s2">what I wrote is exactly what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.599" end="00:34:00.979" style="s2">ask how would you differentiate doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.969" end="00:34:04.759" style="s2">this practice this caring for thyself is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.979" end="00:34:06.859" style="s2">knowing thyself doing this practice for</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.759" end="00:34:09.559" style="s2">preparing for the philosophy of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.859" end="00:34:11.569" style="s2">say life and living versus the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.559" end="00:34:15.020" style="s2">philosophy of death and dying and I put</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.569" end="00:34:16.659" style="s2">it that way because the only background</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.020" end="00:34:23.599" style="s2">that I have in philosophy has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.659" end="00:34:25.039" style="s2">reading and ran book on objectivism so</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.599" end="00:34:28.039" style="s2">which is a different sort of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.039" end="00:34:30.740" style="s2">on caring for thyself being sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.039" end="00:34:31.970" style="s2">selfish in that way which I don&#39;t I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.740" end="00:34:34.010" style="s2">that that&#39;s a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.970" end="00:34:37.429" style="s2">school from stoicism but I was curious</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.010" end="00:34:41.419" style="s2">how you would differentiate the two well</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.429" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">I think yeah so pretty pretty different</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.419" end="00:34:47.419" style="s2">schools of philosophy I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:50.750" style="s2">actually related your question is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.419" end="00:34:53.720" style="s2">related to the question Peter started us</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.750" end="00:34:56.599" style="s2">off with which is like what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.720" end="00:34:59.660" style="s2">practice prepare us for and I think if</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.599" end="00:35:03.410" style="s2">you&#39;re that what I said at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.660" end="00:35:05.510" style="s2">of the essay or the little talk was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.410" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">just this idea that there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.510" end="00:35:11.980" style="s2">rethink of epistemology like study of</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">knowledge what we can know as</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.980" end="00:35:18.289" style="s2">exclusively this issue of like concepts</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:19.880" style="s2">and reasons and arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.289" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">propositional statements and things like</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.880" end="00:35:25.039" style="s2">that but but the older view and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:26.750" style="s2">the more correct view is that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.039" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">epistemological questions are actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.750" end="00:35:32.730" style="s2">bound up in these in these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:35.850" style="s2">moral and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.730" end="00:35:38.660" style="s2">missions so like you can actually get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.850" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">know something better through caring</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.660" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">right so caring gives you a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:44.700" style="s2">of access or a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:48.090" style="s2">perspective on things that just</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.700" end="00:35:51.390" style="s2">knowledge alone doesn&#39;t get and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.090" end="00:35:53.130" style="s2">that so like caring is a kind of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.390" end="00:35:55.560" style="s2">want to call it a strategy because it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.130" end="00:35:57.690" style="s2">just it sounds too calculated but in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.560" end="00:36:00.780" style="s2">way caring is it&#39;s a kind of epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.690" end="00:36:03.990" style="s2">mode and so if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.780" end="00:36:07.380" style="s2">understand things and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.990" end="00:36:10.920" style="s2">orient yourself in terms of what to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.380" end="00:36:13.740" style="s2">say what action to take caring is one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.920" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">the ways to understand so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.740" end="00:36:18.210" style="s2">I mean and that you can think about any</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.260" end="00:36:22.080" style="s2">number of situations in your life where</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.210" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">that would be the case so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.080" end="00:36:29.480" style="s2">hugely complete answer but that&#39;s kinda</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:33.420" style="s2">how I think about it cool all right</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.480" end="00:36:43.350" style="s2">let&#39;s go with Sam Sam if you can unmute</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.420" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">yourself hi Adam I was pleasant to bump</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.350" end="00:36:53.369" style="s2">into you here on the stoah the other day</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:55.170" style="s2">when Jim rut was giving his talk and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.369" end="00:36:59.400" style="s2">Jim ruts involved in the whole game B</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.170" end="00:37:01.890" style="s2">discourse as you know and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.400" end="00:37:03.420" style="s2">mentioned to you in private chat how</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.890" end="00:37:05.910" style="s2">much I&#39;ve been thinking about your</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.420" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">taking up of this idea of askesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.910" end="00:37:11.670" style="s2">and how relevant it is to this game B</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:13.710" style="s2">discourse that&#39;s emerging yeah use we</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.670" end="00:37:15.630" style="s2">see a lot of forms of it like but what</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.710" end="00:37:17.900" style="s2">Benita Roy is doing with collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.630" end="00:37:20.100" style="s2">insight practices and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.900" end="00:37:23.609" style="s2">articulated with just collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.100" end="00:37:25.260" style="s2">intelligence in general so initially I</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.609" end="00:37:26.609" style="s2">was sort of sitting with with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.260" end="00:37:28.680" style="s2">question that I wanted to ask which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.609" end="00:37:32.100" style="s2">you know what role do you think ascesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.680" end="00:37:34.590" style="s2">has to play in this larger bifurcation</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.100" end="00:37:36.660" style="s2">point that game B is looking at between</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.590" end="00:37:39.109" style="s2">the like the likely event of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.660" end="00:37:43.260" style="s2">civilization will collapse versus a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.109" end="00:37:44.910" style="s2">transformation that&#39;s needed but my</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.260" end="00:37:46.570" style="s2">question is actually transformed a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.910" end="00:37:47.710" style="s2">little bit because I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.570" end="00:37:52.570" style="s2">wondering if you share this observation</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.710" end="00:37:55.540" style="s2">that all these forms of what can be</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.570" end="00:37:58.450" style="s2">called askesis or a discursive ethic</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.540" end="00:38:01.660" style="s2">that&#39;s rooted in a kind of disposition</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.450" end="00:38:04.780" style="s2">that&#39;s open to these forms of death it</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.660" end="00:38:07.120" style="s2">seems to be emerged showing up as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.780" end="00:38:09.220" style="s2">emergent phenomenon of these conditions</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.120" end="00:38:11.380" style="s2">as something that&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.220" end="00:38:14.020" style="s2">facilitate the kind of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.380" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">that we need and so I&#39;m wondering do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.020" end="00:38:19.210" style="s2">share that observation do you agree and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:21.750" style="s2">if so why do you think that that would</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.210" end="00:38:26.140" style="s2">be showing up as an emergent phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.750" end="00:38:28.510" style="s2">yeah a lot of good questions there if</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.140" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">folks don&#39;t know what Sam&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.510" end="00:38:37.330" style="s2">about game B is this term that folks</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.680" end="00:38:39.960" style="s2">like Jim Rhett benita Roy and others</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.330" end="00:38:43.960" style="s2">have started to use to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.960" end="00:38:46.690" style="s2">distinguish there kind of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.960" end="00:38:48.760" style="s2">building exercise from what they call</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.690" end="00:38:53.380" style="s2">game a which is basically what we live</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.760" end="00:38:56.830" style="s2">in right now game a is competitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.380" end="00:39:01.840" style="s2">instrumental reason war of all against</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.830" end="00:39:05.620" style="s2">all game B is non rival risks sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.840" end="00:39:09.340" style="s2">non zero some kind of community oriented</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.620" end="00:39:11.500" style="s2">living I don&#39;t know too much about game</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.340" end="00:39:13.210" style="s2">B I know even less about economics and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.500" end="00:39:15.010" style="s2">I&#39;m honestly kind of happy that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.210" end="00:39:17.260" style="s2">know anything about economics because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.010" end="00:39:20.680" style="s2">seems like a real mess to try and figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.260" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">out but yeah I think Bonita and I have</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.680" end="00:39:27.010" style="s2">had conversations along these lines that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:29.890" style="s2">this this whole idea of moving moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.010" end="00:39:34.600" style="s2">back to practice seems like a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.890" end="00:39:36.070" style="s2">game B move because well if you just</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.600" end="00:39:38.350" style="s2">look at what we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.070" end="00:39:43.630" style="s2">we&#39;re moving back to practice but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.350" end="00:39:48.090" style="s2">also moving away from using intellect</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.630" end="00:39:51.130" style="s2">and reason not in the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.090" end="00:39:54.220" style="s2">instrumental calculative manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.130" end="00:39:55.720" style="s2">and exploitation so we&#39;re moving the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.220" end="00:39:57.970" style="s2">Faculty of reason in a different</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.720" end="00:40:00.539" style="s2">direction through practice and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.970" end="00:40:02.669" style="s2">if Jesus has anything to do with game B</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.539" end="00:40:05.009" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.669" end="00:40:07.529" style="s2">can&#39;t have a sort of a game be world</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.009" end="00:40:08.939" style="s2">without without a different sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.529" end="00:40:11.849" style="s2">and without a different sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.939" end="00:40:14.339" style="s2">what reason is and what it&#39;s for so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.849" end="00:40:18.709" style="s2">that&#39;s a short answer to something we</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.339" end="00:40:18.709" style="s2">could talk about for much longer</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.309" end="00:40:31.980" style="s2">cool Travis would you like to read your</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.010" end="00:40:33.299" style="s2">question sure Thank You Adam you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.980" end="00:40:35.880" style="s2">mentioned at the beginning health</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.299" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">faito notes that he feels a strange</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.880" end="00:40:41.970" style="s2">mixture of pain and pleasure when he</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:44.250" style="s2">thinks about Socrates dying sad from his</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.970" end="00:40:47.369" style="s2">friend but he&#39;s happy at the fortitude</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:50.099" style="s2">and preparation of Socrates presents in</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.369" end="00:40:53.099" style="s2">the face of death and a little bit later</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.099" end="00:40:55.799" style="s2">in the dialogue Socrates uses that very</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.099" end="00:40:58.440" style="s2">same phrasing a strange mixture pain and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.799" end="00:41:00.569" style="s2">pleasure and he&#39;s talking about how his</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.440" end="00:41:03.569" style="s2">legs feel and they take the shackles off</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.569" end="00:41:05.279" style="s2">of his legs as the pain leaves he feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.569" end="00:41:07.619" style="s2">he feels the pleasure as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.279" end="00:41:09.150" style="s2">contrast and I think this this</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.619" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">definitely connects to the argument from</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.150" end="00:41:16.109" style="s2">opposites that somebody mentioned and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:17.579" style="s2">question above that&#39;s a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.109" end="00:41:19.319" style="s2">Freud saying you&#39;re sticking you stick</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.579" end="00:41:20.970" style="s2">your leg out from under the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.319" end="00:41:22.980" style="s2">bedsheets and it&#39;s cold you pull it back</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.970" end="00:41:24.329" style="s2">in and you know this is kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.980" end="00:41:28.369" style="s2">constitutes our pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.329" end="00:41:30.900" style="s2">and so just struck right now and how</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.369" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">every day life&#39;s preciousness is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.900" end="00:41:37.549" style="s2">coming to the forefront of all our</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">consciousnesses and we&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.549" end="00:41:43.260" style="s2">feeling everything very differently and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:45.660" style="s2">yeah or of an endemic and desk and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.260" end="00:41:48.329" style="s2">I&#39;m just wondering how we could engage</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.660" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">our practices in this moment to truly</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.329" end="00:41:53.910" style="s2">internalize this and to carry it forward</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:57.559" style="s2">and perhaps even on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.910" end="00:42:00.500" style="s2">this if things are much better we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.559" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">maintain that that sense of preciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.500" end="00:42:05.849" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:08.279" style="s2">about I get this relates also to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.849" end="00:42:10.619" style="s2">question of what what uses philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.279" end="00:42:12.450" style="s2">a moment like this or what uses even</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.619" end="00:42:15.510" style="s2">worst what use are philosophers in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.450" end="00:42:19.670" style="s2">moment like this and you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.510" end="00:42:22.170" style="s2">about what what can we do you know me</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.670" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">the most important thing it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.170" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">for me to do to help the situation right</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.630" end="00:42:30.029" style="s2">now is to stay indoors and to stay stay</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.900" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">away from other people you know but for</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.029" end="00:42:36.329" style="s2">other people for nurses and doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">delivery people and trash collectors and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.329" end="00:42:44.579" style="s2">you know I was just reading about</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:46.859" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a group of the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.579" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">running the energy grid in New York who</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.859" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">are now completely isolated so that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:53.249" style="s2">can stay healthy so they can keep the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:57.150" style="s2">grid running you know so I think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.249" end="00:42:59.910" style="s2">all of these people that really matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.150" end="00:43:02.190" style="s2">you know like really matter and who we</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.910" end="00:43:05.460" style="s2">owe who we owe a debt to right now and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.190" end="00:43:08.849" style="s2">who we will owe a debt to after this and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.460" end="00:43:12.089" style="s2">what can we do and I think one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.849" end="00:43:14.970" style="s2">can do is is is make better sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.089" end="00:43:17.160" style="s2">situation put put some kind of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.970" end="00:43:20.970" style="s2">into the discourse out like in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.160" end="00:43:24.049" style="s2">direction of care we&#39;ve seen just just</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.970" end="00:43:26.460" style="s2">insane headlines about you know like</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.049" end="00:43:29.339" style="s2">hospitals who won&#39;t let their nursing</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.460" end="00:43:31.769" style="s2">staff wear protective gear because it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.339" end="00:43:34.380" style="s2">scare it&#39;ll it&#39;ll scare the customers</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.769" end="00:43:37.980" style="s2">coming in you know it&#39;s just like what</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.380" end="00:43:40.200" style="s2">is this attitude you know I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.980" end="00:43:43.140" style="s2">nurse I&#39;m not an electrician I can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.200" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">those things but I can I can push I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.140" end="00:43:47.849" style="s2">push conversations and directions I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:53.670" style="s2">push put pressure in ways and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.849" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">just just in that sense of like what can</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.670" end="00:43:59.309" style="s2">we do I think about those things and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:44:01.230" style="s2">that&#39;s so that&#39;s like if if we have any</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.309" end="00:44:03.599" style="s2">if philosophers really do have any of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.230" end="00:44:06.420" style="s2">this kind of lucidity about us we should</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.599" end="00:44:09.859" style="s2">we should be able to to kind of push in</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.420" end="00:44:12.299" style="s2">directions that that help and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.859" end="00:44:15.180" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of how I think about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.299" end="00:44:19.790" style="s2">sort of a I don&#39;t know in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.180" end="00:44:23.869" style="s2">assistant to the process thanks Adam</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.790" end="00:44:23.869" style="s2">someone just wrote steal the culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:29.250" style="s2">Todd would you like to read your</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.550" end="00:44:34.230" style="s2">question you still have the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.250" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">ask it yeah yeah Travis just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.230" end="00:44:42.450" style="s2">part of it so uh yeah Adam it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:43.650" style="s2">see you again yeah yes I&#39;m smiling when</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.450" end="00:44:45.180" style="s2">I saw you there I said oh there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.650" end="00:44:47.099" style="s2">four people on this thing and then I saw</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.180" end="00:44:52.349" style="s2">there&#39;s like thirty thirty some of my</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.099" end="00:44:53.730" style="s2">people so the in the Phaedo Socrates he</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.349" end="00:44:55.650" style="s2">says well what are we gonna do with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.730" end="00:44:58.770" style="s2">rest of the day before they give me the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.650" end="00:45:00.599" style="s2">poison let&#39;s just think if we can chase</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.770" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">away this fear of death and he came up</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.599" end="00:45:05.190" style="s2">with the three arguments opposites come</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:07.770" style="s2">from opposites just Travis mentioned so</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.190" end="00:45:10.380" style="s2">death comes from life therefore life</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.770" end="00:45:12.559" style="s2">must come after death and the second one</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.380" end="00:45:16.380" style="s2">was knowledge as recollection yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.559" end="00:45:17.880" style="s2">because he said for example when you see</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.380" end="00:45:20.339" style="s2">two things that are almost perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.880" end="00:45:22.680" style="s2">equal how is it that you knew they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.339" end="00:45:24.420" style="s2">almost perfectly equal because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.680" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">never perceived it with your physical</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.420" end="00:45:29.190" style="s2">bodily sense organs anything that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:30.450" style="s2">things that are perfectly the same so</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.190" end="00:45:31.559" style="s2">you must have been born with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.450" end="00:45:33.930" style="s2">knowledge because you could not have</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.559" end="00:45:36.329" style="s2">learned it after you were born and if</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.930" end="00:45:38.030" style="s2">you were born with that knowledge you</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.329" end="00:45:42.089" style="s2">must have had it before you were born</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.030" end="00:45:43.980" style="s2">these archetypal ideas yeah and he said</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.089" end="00:45:47.010" style="s2">and I guess quoted in there because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.980" end="00:45:51.240" style="s2">a strong statement or he says basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.010" end="00:45:53.069" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have the one use eternal</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.240" end="00:45:55.740" style="s2">absolute ideas then there is no such</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.069" end="00:45:57.420" style="s2">thing as a soul and if there&#39;s no soul</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.740" end="00:46:00.329" style="s2">then there&#39;s no such thing as these</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.420" end="00:46:02.670" style="s2">absolute eternal standards by which we</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.329" end="00:46:06.329" style="s2">judge the relative and imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.670" end="00:46:08.369" style="s2">physical things so what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.329" end="00:46:12.299" style="s2">about that argument the arc tipple ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.369" end="00:46:18.059" style="s2">and the soul either they both exist or</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.299" end="00:46:21.720" style="s2">neither one exists I this kind of gets</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.059" end="00:46:25.650" style="s2">back to the the question Rick was asking</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.720" end="00:46:28.140" style="s2">I I think these these argue</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.650" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">have to be supplemented with experiences</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.140" end="00:46:34.490" style="s2">and the experiences I think are very</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:36.359" style="s2">convincing and the arguments are</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.490" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">convincing after you&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.359" end="00:46:41.220" style="s2">experiences and I&#39;m not sure if I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:44.819" style="s2">find them so convincing without the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.220" end="00:46:47.789" style="s2">experiences you know it sounds i I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.819" end="00:46:50.130" style="s2">don&#39;t know but I found I find the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.789" end="00:46:52.680" style="s2">perspective convincing on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.130" end="00:46:53.970" style="s2">experience but that&#39;s I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.680" end="00:46:55.140" style="s2">know what those arguments would read</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.970" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">like if I didn&#39;t have those experiences</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.140" end="00:46:58.710" style="s2">if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:04.470" style="s2">yeah yeah that totally makes sense kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.710" end="00:47:07.460" style="s2">of like philosophy seemed boring and not</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.470" end="00:47:09.779" style="s2">pertinent then you have a few major</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.460" end="00:47:11.220" style="s2">psychedelic experiences and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.779" end="00:47:14.190" style="s2">oh that&#39;s what they were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.220" end="00:47:16.500" style="s2">that yeah or the other way around you</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.190" end="00:47:20.250" style="s2">know I think that&#39;s how it works for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.500" end="00:47:21.690" style="s2">kind of yeah yeah or mutually anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.250" end="00:47:24.660" style="s2">was just wondering that argument if it</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.690" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">seemed convincing because it kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.660" end="00:47:28.589" style="s2">think even sovereignty says neither none</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:32.809" style="s2">of these arguments are really convincing</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.589" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">but you have to do the best we can like</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.809" end="00:47:38.910" style="s2">strapping a raft together and some I</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:40.680" style="s2">think it&#39;s in this and then we&#39;ll hold</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.910" end="00:47:42.270" style="s2">on to it you know and make the best of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.680" end="00:47:48.260" style="s2">it and here&#39;s my here&#39;s the best I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.270" end="00:47:52.650" style="s2">got right that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.260" end="00:47:53.970" style="s2">cool all right so we might have this</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.650" end="00:47:54.539" style="s2">might be the last question we&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.970" end="00:47:59.089" style="s2">it goes</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.539" end="00:48:05.180" style="s2">Nate if you can unmute yourself and ask</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.089" end="00:48:07.859" style="s2">Adam your question hi hi Adam honey</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.180" end="00:48:09.510" style="s2">Phoebe has been helping me to see the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.859" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">ways in which I thought I was ready to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.510" end="00:48:14.940" style="s2">die but was to some extent fooling</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:17.039" style="s2">myself maybe to a large extent as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.940" end="00:48:19.140" style="s2">result I&#39;ve been meditating on how close</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.039" end="00:48:21.390" style="s2">death is to life even if I usually</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.140" end="00:48:23.400" style="s2">pretend that it&#39;s far away and how the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.390" end="00:48:25.020" style="s2">way I orient myself towards death isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.400" end="00:48:27.630" style="s2">separate from how I orient myself</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.020" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">towards life does that bring anything up</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.630" end="00:48:35.400" style="s2">for you how would Socrates Plato or the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">stoic speak to that yeah it does I I</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:39.799" style="s2">relate to this question in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:39.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.050" end="00:48:43.620" style="s2">the Socratic tradition sort of relates</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.090" end="00:48:47.130" style="s2">to the question of knowledge and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.620" end="00:48:50.370" style="s2">you know I know I know that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.130" end="00:48:52.920" style="s2">or I&#39;m I I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.370" end="00:48:56.520" style="s2">but I&#39;m at least aware of my ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.920" end="00:49:00.410" style="s2">and I feel similarly about this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.520" end="00:49:03.000" style="s2">readiness for death even if you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.410" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">engage in these practices and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.000" end="00:49:08.550" style="s2">meditate and and focus on sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:11.610" style="s2">non-attachment and dissolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.550" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">ego and things like that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.610" end="00:49:20.910" style="s2">aspirational certainly for me I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a practice and that sense something</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.910" end="00:49:24.090" style="s2">that you have to keep doing over and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.320" end="00:49:26.130" style="s2">over again and that&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.090" end="00:49:28.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that it happens and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.130" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">have it and it&#39;s there forever I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.080" end="00:49:35.240" style="s2">you have to continually engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:35.240" style="s2">practice and so in that sense it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.810" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">it&#39;s ongoing it&#39;s a process thank you</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.640" end="00:49:47.990" style="s2">all right so this would be the last</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.110" end="00:49:55.290" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.990" end="00:49:57.360" style="s2">Alexander winter I it was just more of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.290" end="00:49:59.910" style="s2">comment rather than a question but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.360" end="00:50:01.680" style="s2">think to add to what was said about what</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.910" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">come philosophers do I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:08.700" style="s2">this sense of we can we are so empowered</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.710" style="s2">by technology right now that we can tap</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.700" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">into networks and I think one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.710" end="00:50:16.020" style="s2">problems that people are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:18.510" style="s2">right now beyond the question of death</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.020" end="00:50:20.610" style="s2">is what is truth you know everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.510" end="00:50:22.380" style="s2">scrambling for finding out what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.610" end="00:50:22.650" style="s2">on with the virus how can people stay</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.380" end="00:50:25.860" style="s2">safe</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.650" end="00:50:28.080" style="s2">how can people be protected how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.860" end="00:50:31.260" style="s2">make sure that what&#39;s gonna happen in</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.080" end="00:50:33.030" style="s2">the near to far future is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.260" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">best course of action that we can take</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.030" end="00:50:36.870" style="s2">collectively and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:39.930" style="s2">strength of philosophers is to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.870" end="00:50:41.250" style="s2">in conjunction with you know science I</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.930" end="00:50:45.510" style="s2">mean which is really the child of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.250" end="00:50:47.070" style="s2">philosophy to find out what what is how</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.510" end="00:50:48.270" style="s2">do we make more light of the world how</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.070" end="00:50:51.060" style="s2">do we understand that of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.270" end="00:50:52.030" style="s2">happening and then use that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.060" end="00:50:54.310" style="s2">and make it</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.030" end="00:50:56.200" style="s2">snowball by building systems like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.310" end="00:50:59.170" style="s2">seen many people you know put together</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.200" end="00:51:02.340" style="s2">spreadsheets put together mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.170" end="00:51:04.930" style="s2">sharing knowledge that really do help</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.340" end="00:51:07.570" style="s2">and one example would be something I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.930" end="00:51:10.180" style="s2">just saw today it&#39;s a group from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.570" end="00:51:13.660" style="s2">Czech Republic or Chucky called masks</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.180" end="00:51:15.430" style="s2">for all org where this course has now</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.660" end="00:51:17.320" style="s2">shifted toward recommendation as</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.430" end="00:51:19.930" style="s2">everyone should be wearing masks because</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.320" end="00:51:21.730" style="s2">that has kept the spread very very low</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.930" end="00:51:22.180" style="s2">in the Czech Republic compared to other</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.730" end="00:51:25.210" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.180" end="00:51:28.120" style="s2">yep yeah yeah I&#39;m with you on all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.210" end="00:51:30.250" style="s2">that and I think that&#39;s why you need the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.120" end="00:51:33.730" style="s2">knowledge knowledge truth and reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.250" end="00:51:35.500" style="s2">side is still there you just need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.730" end="00:51:37.990" style="s2">supplement with the the caring the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.500" end="00:51:39.460" style="s2">caring intuitive side as well all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.990" end="00:51:41.620" style="s2">but yeah I&#39;m with you</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.460" end="00:51:45.310" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.620" end="00:51:49.210" style="s2">things that philosophers should be able</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.310" end="00:51:52.060" style="s2">to do is is evaluate truth claims the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.210" end="00:51:53.770" style="s2">epistemic conditions of those claims how</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.060" end="00:51:55.780" style="s2">those claims function in the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.770" end="00:51:59.350" style="s2">how those you know all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.780" end="00:52:01.480" style="s2">stuff that you know you you&#39;re trained</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.350" end="00:52:03.670" style="s2">and to do in a university that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.480" end="00:52:07.120" style="s2">all extremely extremely relevant right</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.670" end="00:52:09.880" style="s2">now to and in and with that I think also</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.120" end="00:52:13.060" style="s2">the providing of visions you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.880" end="00:52:15.070" style="s2">sort of constructing future futures in</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.060" end="00:52:17.530" style="s2">our heads conceptually that other people</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.070" end="00:52:19.270" style="s2">can latch onto yeah I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.530" end="00:52:21.460" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s the sense I get from</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.270" end="00:52:22.780" style="s2">like the game be crowd that we were</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.460" end="00:52:26.280" style="s2">talking about earlier is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.780" end="00:52:30.730" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of speculative philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.280" end="00:52:33.400" style="s2">speculative not meaning like you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.730" end="00:52:36.850" style="s2">just anything goes just kind of fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.400" end="00:52:39.030" style="s2">imagination but seeing into a possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.850" end="00:52:41.650" style="s2">future you know just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.030" end="00:52:44.490" style="s2">through the imagination creating a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.650" end="00:52:48.450" style="s2">possible world that we could aim towards</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.490" end="00:52:48.450" style="s2">so yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.610" end="00:52:54.280" style="s2">all right so we&#39;re gonna end it here and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.880" end="00:52:56.350" style="s2">in a moment I&#39;ll do some kind of closing</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.280" end="00:53:00.010" style="s2">announcements but Adam do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.350" end="00:53:01.960" style="s2">closing thoughts for the group I know</p>
