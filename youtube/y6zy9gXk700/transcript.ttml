<p begin="00:01:22.520" end="00:01:28.790" style="s2">divisive to generate the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.370" end="00:01:31.430" style="s2">conversation and also filtered by ones</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:20.450" style="s2">have these questions on the floor and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:22.340" style="s2">Hrothgar helped also is like just kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.450" end="00:02:24.230" style="s2">of naturally bidding them into whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.340" end="00:02:26.659" style="s2">it seemed right and we tried this like</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.230" end="00:02:28.219" style="s2">multiple times and these same bins kept</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.659" end="00:02:29.290" style="s2">emerging of like these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.219" end="00:02:36.650" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.290" end="00:02:38.390" style="s2">we said I said yeah they said - yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.650" end="00:02:40.940" style="s2">can you so you said that this is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:42.470" style="s2">the culmination this of years of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.940" end="00:02:44.180" style="s2">experimenting with with these questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.470" end="00:02:46.069" style="s2">can you talk about like the very early</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.180" end="00:02:48.440" style="s2">days like proto a school before it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.069" end="00:02:50.420" style="s2">even conceived as a game where did this</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.440" end="00:02:53.930" style="s2">the where did the kernel of this idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.420" end="00:02:55.849" style="s2">begin yeah some Twitter polls I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.930" end="00:02:58.790" style="s2">know if you follow me on Twitter but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.849" end="00:03:01.190" style="s2">like a really obsessive Twitter puller</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.790" end="00:03:03.709" style="s2">I&#39;ve tweeted I don&#39;t know maybe fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.190" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">hundred polls at this point which I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.709" end="00:03:09.049" style="s2">recorded in the spreadsheet over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">course of maybe since maybe four years I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.049" end="00:03:13.250" style="s2">think so I would just obsessively write</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:15.560" style="s2">down these questions and get responses</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.250" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">and then I would start to go to parties</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.560" end="00:03:18.920" style="s2">and then realize actually it might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:20.510" style="s2">good if I could bring some of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.920" end="00:03:22.220" style="s2">questions than a party so I would start</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.510" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">writing these questions down and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.220" end="00:03:28.010" style="s2">eventually this transitioned into like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.970" end="00:03:29.810" style="s2">having little pieces of paper cut out</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.010" end="00:03:31.970" style="s2">with the questions on them and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.810" end="00:03:34.160" style="s2">had this stack she was really big stack</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.970" end="00:03:36.290" style="s2">at this point I was like 500 questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.160" end="00:03:38.329" style="s2">we ended up chiseling it down a lot for</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.290" end="00:03:40.010" style="s2">a school and that was just like carry</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.329" end="00:03:41.450" style="s2">them around to parties all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.010" end="00:03:43.819" style="s2">then eventually people started to saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.450" end="00:03:46.040" style="s2">I would buy this like if you were</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.819" end="00:03:48.829" style="s2">selling this as a product I would buy it</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.040" end="00:03:50.389" style="s2">and then I got me thinking and then then</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.829" end="00:03:52.700" style="s2">I was hanging with Hrothgar for a while</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.389" end="00:03:54.440" style="s2">and then Hrothgar was like he really</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.700" end="00:03:57.769" style="s2">loved it he&#39;s like you know I am down</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.440" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">for helping make this a reality so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.769" end="00:04:02.060" style="s2">so why did you need questions and why</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.069" style="s2">did you start doing asking Twitter polls</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.060" end="00:04:07.849" style="s2">in the first place why did you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.069" end="00:04:14.510" style="s2">questions to go to parties with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.849" end="00:04:18.480" style="s2">the deal any beers they drink beers</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.510" end="00:04:18.480" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.729" end="00:04:22.669" style="s2">people just go to parties and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.169" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">they&#39;re like what are what are what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.669" end="00:04:26.780" style="s2">we doing now you go and you you find</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">someone and then you talk to them for</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.780" end="00:04:31.250" style="s2">what purpose what are you doing like are</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:32.660" style="s2">you trying to like most efficiently find</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.250" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">someone who you want to like be your</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.660" end="00:04:36.650" style="s2">best friend if so you should like know</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:39.050" style="s2">what your goal is and then optimize the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:41.000" style="s2">amount of questions to learn that so</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.050" end="00:04:42.650" style="s2">like my approach to parties is like very</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.000" end="00:04:45.410" style="s2">like how do we max</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.650" end="00:04:47.240" style="s2">is the enjoyment and like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.410" end="00:04:50.509" style="s2">connection I want to find from this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.240" end="00:04:53.259" style="s2">party is my personal goal I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.509" end="00:04:55.699" style="s2">Hrothgar might have a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.259" end="00:05:00.139" style="s2">do you want George say something say</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.699" end="00:05:02.389" style="s2">your relationship to this mm-hmm well I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.139" end="00:05:05.270" style="s2">really like I really like the concept</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.389" end="00:05:08.509" style="s2">from the first time is that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.270" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">and I was around when Africa was in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.509" end="00:05:14.060" style="s2">testing phase were like printed on or</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:15.169" style="s2">like handwritten on cards and brought</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.060" end="00:05:18.490" style="s2">the party students</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.169" end="00:05:23.389" style="s2">I just saw the effect that had on people</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.490" end="00:05:25.699" style="s2">I think a really well-crafted question</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.389" end="00:05:30.590" style="s2">is like the antidote to having a strong</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.699" end="00:05:33.229" style="s2">opinion about something we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.590" end="00:05:36.349" style="s2">good questions can crack people open</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.229" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">nicking they can illuminate the places</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.349" end="00:05:48.050" style="s2">where we we&#39;ve assumed thing and then in</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:50.470" style="s2">the context of a party for some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.050" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">social space where people are already</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.470" end="00:05:54.740" style="s2">sharing and discovering each other and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:05:59.389" style="s2">it just seems like a really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.740" end="00:06:01.699" style="s2">tool yeah I also feel like and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.389" end="00:06:04.130" style="s2">this is a weird quirky like rationality</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.699" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">thing but people like not answering</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.130" end="00:06:08.599" style="s2">questions like where are you from you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:09.860" style="s2">know and just being like no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.599" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">going to answer that question I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.860" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">have more interesting engaging</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:17.030" style="s2">conversation with people that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:20.599" style="s2">based around like your job or like where</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.030" end="00:06:22.250" style="s2">you live or like these very basic facts</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.599" end="00:06:24.979" style="s2">about who you are but rather getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.250" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">into the your you&#39;re like opinions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.979" end="00:06:30.440" style="s2">belief and like controversy and intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.639" style="s2">and I think that this game also reminds</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.440" end="00:06:33.289" style="s2">me of hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.639" end="00:06:35.330" style="s2">which was something that we played in</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.289" end="00:06:37.130" style="s2">the Seattle rationality kind of Golden</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.130" end="00:11:20.030" style="s2">well I&#39;ve tweeted a few times over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.440" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">years I usually will tweet things about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.030" end="00:11:24.130" style="s2">once a year to see like change every</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:24.130" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.530" end="00:11:29.220" style="s2">yeah people don&#39;t like it people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:33.000" style="s2">don&#39;t really like their eating meat</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.220" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">being equated to bestiality if I could</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.000" end="00:11:36.770" style="s2">press a button and then have it all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:39.740" style="s2">the meat-eaters instead switch to being</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.770" end="00:11:42.930" style="s2">bestiality people I would do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.740" end="00:11:44.430" style="s2">that&#39;s also a technique that you use so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.930" end="00:11:45.810" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s turn to kind of a technique</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.430" end="00:11:47.520" style="s2">that you use in some of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.810" end="00:11:50.340" style="s2">or some of the different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.520" end="00:11:52.350" style="s2">questions that like the form essentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.340" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">of like pressing a button that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.350" end="00:11:55.770" style="s2">something that you use what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:59.370" style="s2">about like why do you use that as it as</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.770" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">a tool for yeah it&#39;s neutral because</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.370" end="00:12:03.960" style="s2">there&#39;s like a lot of ways in which the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:06.180" style="s2">answers to a question will change a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.960" end="00:12:07.620" style="s2">depending on like the very specifics of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.180" end="00:12:09.390" style="s2">the framing and I&#39;ve tried this before</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.620" end="00:12:11.490" style="s2">with series of Twitter polls right I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.390" end="00:12:13.620" style="s2">ask the same essential question but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.490" end="00:12:15.240" style="s2">will change like very minor details</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.620" end="00:12:16.890" style="s2">around it like do you have to press a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.240" end="00:12:19.140" style="s2">button or do you have to walk across the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.890" end="00:12:21.570" style="s2">street and like push someone over like</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.140" end="00:12:24.300" style="s2">you know but but the outcome is the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.570" end="00:12:26.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s so I try and have like a stable</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.300" end="00:12:28.740" style="s2">neutral middle ground that I use for</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.670" end="00:12:31.950" style="s2">most of the questions to try and keep it</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.740" end="00:12:33.480" style="s2">like kind of even and then that is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.950" end="00:12:35.730" style="s2">button press think is like a button</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.480" end="00:12:37.740" style="s2">pressing it is an action that you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.730" end="00:12:39.930" style="s2">to do it&#39;s not like a nikkie negation</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.740" end="00:12:40.920" style="s2">act for like a lack of action as in like</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.930" end="00:12:42.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t have you have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.920" end="00:12:45.030" style="s2">perform an action but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.660" end="00:12:47.850" style="s2">extremely minimal so that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.030" end="00:12:50.220" style="s2">combination is my favorite are there</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.850" end="00:12:56.270" style="s2">other techniques that you use yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.220" end="00:13:00.210" style="s2">there&#39;s the the demon child series so</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.270" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">like behind one door there&#39;s a demon is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.210" end="00:13:03.930" style="s2">about to like do something horrible and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:07.020" style="s2">over here a child is about to die and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.930" end="00:13:08.760" style="s2">you can only like save the child or you</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.020" end="00:13:11.610" style="s2">can go and stop the demon but not both</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.760" end="00:13:13.590" style="s2">so that&#39;s another one that I really like</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.610" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">that you can like push a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.590" end="00:13:19.080" style="s2">things into that series like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:21.960" style="s2">worth of a child really there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.080" end="00:13:25.020" style="s2">series of like distant so I tested like</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.960" end="00:13:27.030" style="s2">a distance question so how far away from</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.020" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">a child do you have to be before you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.030" end="00:13:31.800" style="s2">morally obligated to save its life and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:33.810" style="s2">like the percentage of people who will</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.800" end="00:13:36.990" style="s2">answer yes you are morally obligated to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.810" end="00:13:38.250" style="s2">save the child&#39;s life like increases the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.990" end="00:13:39.950" style="s2">closer you get to the child and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.250" end="00:13:43.200" style="s2">decreases the farther away you get</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.950" end="00:13:45.660" style="s2">interesting so what is this revealing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.200" end="00:13:48.050" style="s2">you about people what does this tell you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.660" end="00:13:50.520" style="s2">about how how we think about things and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.050" end="00:13:53.430" style="s2">like how groups work or how people</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.520" end="00:13:57.510" style="s2">approach different moral questions do</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.430" end="00:14:01.830" style="s2">you have any grand cakes on that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.510" end="00:14:04.110" style="s2">think that people have some sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.830" end="00:14:06.420" style="s2">system of operation that they use and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.110" end="00:14:07.860" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely complicated and it relies</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.420" end="00:14:09.750" style="s2">on a whole bunch of like tiny little</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.860" end="00:14:11.339" style="s2">rules that are like conditional and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.750" end="00:14:13.500" style="s2">other things but this is subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.339" end="00:14:15.089" style="s2">right like you don&#39;t have you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.500" end="00:14:17.310" style="s2">write a book about like the rules of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.089" end="00:14:20.580" style="s2">which you operate and instead we use</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.310" end="00:14:22.589" style="s2">like labels which we stick on to our</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.580" end="00:14:24.510" style="s2">extremely complicated operating systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.589" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">as like a general approximation of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.510" end="00:14:28.470" style="s2">we do and so the thing that I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:30.779" style="s2">interested in is we&#39;re revealing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.470" end="00:14:33.240" style="s2">separation between like the actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.779" end="00:14:36.029" style="s2">extremely complex system and the labels</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.240" end="00:14:37.980" style="s2">so we&#39;ll say yes this is moral but then</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.029" end="00:14:40.040" style="s2">if we like tweak it we can see the ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.980" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">in which that like peels off away from</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.040" end="00:14:44.790" style="s2">the way we actually operate I think this</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:47.700" style="s2">is fine this makes sense like like we</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.790" end="00:14:48.870" style="s2">have to sort of have simplistic rules of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.700" end="00:14:50.040" style="s2">operation if we&#39;re going to describe</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.870" end="00:14:52.260" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing because it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.040" end="00:14:55.260" style="s2">to actually describe the kind of rules</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.260" end="00:15:00.060" style="s2">were operating on yeah hrothgar do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.260" end="00:15:01.740" style="s2">have any anything to add to that um I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.060" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">really really I really enjoyed that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.740" end="00:15:11.190" style="s2">description I&#39;m not sure I have anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:13.350" style="s2">out immediately so um cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.190" end="00:15:16.440" style="s2">how did you so how did you like parse</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.350" end="00:15:20.760" style="s2">down this deck so like popular demand</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.440" end="00:15:22.950" style="s2">like effective use in games once that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.760" end="00:15:28.980" style="s2">you found to be your favorites how did</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.950" end="00:15:31.380" style="s2">you get from a thousand to 125 we did</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.980" end="00:15:35.160" style="s2">the system together Hrothgar and I I had</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.380" end="00:15:38.040" style="s2">a huge spreadsheet list and then we went</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.160" end="00:15:39.450" style="s2">down we&#39;ve ranked it right we each went</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.040" end="00:15:42.149" style="s2">down and put our own number like on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.450" end="00:15:44.579" style="s2">scale from 1 to 7 and then we weighted</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.149" end="00:15:46.470" style="s2">our own rankings pretty high and then we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.579" end="00:15:48.420" style="s2">had I think what 20 friends or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.470" end="00:15:50.490" style="s2">go through and rate all of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.420" end="00:15:52.440" style="s2">themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.490" end="00:15:54.839" style="s2">questions were already selected from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.440" end="00:15:58.230" style="s2">top most commented or liked retweet</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.839" end="00:15:59.700" style="s2">commented on Twitter as well as the ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.230" end="00:16:02.750" style="s2">that you can&#39;t really tweet the ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.700" end="00:16:06.270" style="s2">that are open-ended as opposed to closed</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.750" end="00:16:07.589" style="s2">so we had that that filtration system</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.270" end="00:16:09.899" style="s2">initially and then we had a ranking</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.589" end="00:16:12.540" style="s2">system and then we went through and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.899" end="00:16:14.610" style="s2">after we like averaged all the scores we</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.540" end="00:16:16.470" style="s2">manually sort of tweaked some things we</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.610" end="00:16:18.779" style="s2">liked and didn&#39;t like and also took the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.470" end="00:16:21.060" style="s2">top 25 questions from each category so</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.779" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">we had to categorize each of all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.060" end="00:16:25.290" style="s2">those questions which there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:27.750" style="s2">them and then then we took the top 25</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.290" end="00:16:30.839" style="s2">from each category the Sun right do I</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.750" end="00:16:33.029" style="s2">miss anything Hrothgar sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.839" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">it was really fun putting this together</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.029" end="00:16:41.940" style="s2">I remember your parents also ranking the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:44.190" style="s2">question and we forgot yeah it really</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.940" end="00:16:45.450" style="s2">matters the specific phrasing really</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.190" end="00:16:48.060" style="s2">matters for how people end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.450" end="00:16:50.700" style="s2">interpreting the thing yeah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.060" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">they&#39;re examples of questions I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.700" end="00:16:56.430" style="s2">know if I have an example right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:57.990" style="s2">where if you phrase it one way just in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.430" end="00:16:59.910" style="s2">conversation the conversation will die</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.990" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">and then phrase slightly differently it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.910" end="00:17:07.020" style="s2">generates a huge lively discussion so</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:09.390" style="s2">cool does tune into that yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.020" end="00:17:12.329" style="s2">super interesting do you have like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.390" end="00:17:15.030" style="s2">working hypothesis as to like why that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.329" end="00:17:18.449" style="s2">that happens or what kinds of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.030" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">asking what questions versus like who</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.449" end="00:17:22.380" style="s2">questions or any anything like that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">just seems like that&#39;s a theme that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.380" end="00:17:27.240" style="s2">framing like the specific ways that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:30.410" style="s2">question is being asked like engenders</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.240" end="00:17:35.340" style="s2">either possibility or it closes off</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.410" end="00:17:37.410" style="s2">possibility so one very general rule is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.340" end="00:17:41.210" style="s2">that yes-or-no questions tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.410" end="00:17:45.150" style="s2">dead-end than other kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.210" end="00:17:47.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s usually possible to reframe</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.150" end="00:17:50.460" style="s2">yes-or-no question and a more open way</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.900" end="00:17:55.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the one one thing that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.460" end="00:17:57.450" style="s2">mind there&#39;s also questions that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.140" end="00:17:59.820" style="s2">good to listen to so this was one</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.450" end="00:18:01.770" style="s2">criteria that like we had to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.820" end="00:18:03.630" style="s2">over time that you can&#39;t just ask</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.770" end="00:18:04.260" style="s2">questions which people love to answer</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.630" end="00:18:06.600" style="s2">you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.260" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">ask questions that people love to listen</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.600" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">to other people answer is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:13.110" style="s2">important and that will cause an actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">conversation because some people like</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.110" end="00:18:17.310" style="s2">really want to hear what&#39;s going on or</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.020" style="s2">is there&#39;s a lot of questions out there</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.310" end="00:18:21.780" style="s2">that are so much fun to just answer</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.020" end="00:18:24.450" style="s2">yourself but will kill any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.780" end="00:18:26.700" style="s2">momentum collectively and so we did have</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.450" end="00:18:28.830" style="s2">to like pry out some of those questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.700" end="00:18:30.420" style="s2">from from the deck because we really</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.830" end="00:18:33.750" style="s2">liked them but they just aren&#39;t good for</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.420" end="00:18:36.030" style="s2">groups yeah that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.750" end="00:18:37.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.030" end="00:18:38.790" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely lots of questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.170" end="00:18:39.990" style="s2">that for yourself that would be great</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.790" end="00:18:41.700" style="s2">but for other people because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.990" end="00:18:43.680" style="s2">almost questions like bring out stories</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.700" end="00:18:45.330" style="s2">and people and bring out like novelty</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.680" end="00:18:48.210" style="s2">like you may I mean I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.330" end="00:18:50.610" style="s2">answering questions in this deck and not</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.210" end="00:18:51.810" style="s2">knowing my answer beforehand and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.610" end="00:18:54.390" style="s2">something kind of that puts you on your</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.810" end="00:18:56.430" style="s2">edge when you are in front of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.390" end="00:18:58.770" style="s2">especially answering a question that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.430" end="00:19:01.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have a working hypothesis for</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.770" end="00:19:05.460" style="s2">you&#39;re just freeform that&#39;s cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.400" end="00:19:07.080" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one more thing is we try</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.460" end="00:19:12.180" style="s2">to include only questions that people</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.080" end="00:19:13.830" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have cached answers for that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.180" end="00:19:15.210" style="s2">really important and specifically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.830" end="00:19:17.130" style="s2">even better to have questions where</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.210" end="00:19:20.220" style="s2">every time you hear the question your</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.130" end="00:19:22.830" style="s2">answer is going to be different so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.220" end="00:19:24.900" style="s2">you if you if you develop an answer at</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.830" end="00:19:27.930" style="s2">one time it&#39;s not going to hold for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.900" end="00:19:33.000" style="s2">next time you get a question that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.930" end="00:19:36.270" style="s2">true for all of them but we aspire great</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.000" end="00:19:38.340" style="s2">and I guess just before we move to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.270" end="00:19:40.950" style="s2">question and answer period with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.340" end="00:19:42.360" style="s2">audience can you tell us what&#39;s next for</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.950" end="00:19:51.030" style="s2">a school is there anything on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.360" end="00:19:52.770" style="s2">horizon yes school over to you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.030" end="00:19:54.900" style="s2">give us a little juicy secret about</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.270" end="00:21:11.190" style="s2">spaces I&#39;m thinking like Robin Hanson</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.470" end="00:21:31.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know how they would answer a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.090" end="00:21:34.380" style="s2">of these questions and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.860" end="00:21:37.470" style="s2">different I think I&#39;d probably person</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.380" end="00:21:38.460" style="s2">had the least ability to predict which I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.470" end="00:21:42.870" style="s2">would have to think about that I</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.310" end="00:21:53.460" style="s2">think about it the when you ask the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.230" end="00:21:55.560" style="s2">question the first thing that popped</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.460" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">into my mind with the Pope just because</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.560" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">it&#39;s nice it&#39;s a good answer that would</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:09.930" style="s2">be hilarious</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.890" end="00:22:22.830" style="s2">lot of Robyn Nance and I wish I had your</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:24.420" style="s2">courage to ask these questions and just</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.830" end="00:22:27.570" style="s2">take the heat from all the people that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.420" end="00:22:29.400" style="s2">are just bounded to turn to misinterpret</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.570" end="00:22:30.650" style="s2">or hear another project their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.400" end="00:22:33.920" style="s2">insecurities</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.650" end="00:22:37.940" style="s2">sacred cows on you but my question is</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.920" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">are 30 questions that you really like</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.940" end="00:22:42.710" style="s2">but you didn&#39;t include an asshole</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:50.300" style="s2">because they are too outside the Overton</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.710" end="00:22:55.330" style="s2">Window even for you there&#39;s this one</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.300" end="00:22:55.330" style="s2">question which is like too far</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:23:02.990" style="s2">rosco do you know the one I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.930" end="00:23:05.750" style="s2">of no it&#39;s just more shock value there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.990" end="00:23:09.160" style="s2">like questions that are more like force</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.750" end="00:23:14.420" style="s2">you to consider really horrific things I</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.160" end="00:23:16.100" style="s2">can think of one yeah but in regards to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.420" end="00:23:18.230" style="s2">non shock value questions no I put</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.100" end="00:23:21.530" style="s2">literally everything in there that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.230" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">thought had any sort of thing like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.530" end="00:23:25.610" style="s2">don&#39;t think we held back at all but</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:31.610" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely some really like</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.610" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">gross out horror ones category for them</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.610" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">that&#39;s cold might be the right place</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.340" end="00:23:54.860" style="s2">great thank you David so Travis would</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.520" end="00:23:57.620" style="s2">you like to ask your question yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.860" end="00:24:01.310" style="s2">hope it&#39;s not too windy over here so</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.620" end="00:24:03.800" style="s2">what role did your experiments with acid</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.310" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">play in the development of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.800" end="00:24:09.590" style="s2">and did a majority of the questions come</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:12.380" style="s2">during trips</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.590" end="00:24:14.870" style="s2">soon after trips or during periods of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.380" end="00:24:17.720" style="s2">like relative abstinence and is there</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.870" end="00:24:20.210" style="s2">any correlation between like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.720" end="00:24:23.230" style="s2">mind-altering properties of the drug and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.210" end="00:24:31.250" style="s2">the types of questions that you ask I</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.230" end="00:24:33.320" style="s2">like that question so rasca I had an</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.250" end="00:24:35.960" style="s2">idea to actually make a deck called the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.320" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">acid deck and it&#39;s for reading the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.960" end="00:24:40.220" style="s2">questions while you are tripping and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.140" style="s2">do actually have a plan to do this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.220" end="00:24:44.180" style="s2">probably going to be like maybe after</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.140" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">another deck or two but</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.180" end="00:24:48.800" style="s2">but acid questions though the questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:51.310" style="s2">that you come up with on acid that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.800" end="00:24:57.020" style="s2">really meaningful for you on acid or not</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.310" end="00:24:59.330" style="s2">like easily generalizable to people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.020" end="00:25:00.890" style="s2">are not on acid so I don&#39;t know if how</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.330" end="00:25:03.170" style="s2">many here have like an experience but a</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.890" end="00:25:04.850" style="s2">lot of it&#39;s like like what are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.170" end="00:25:07.220" style="s2">afraid of it&#39;s like a very general</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.850" end="00:25:10.280" style="s2">question it might not generate great</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:12.560" style="s2">conversation but it would be a great</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.280" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">rabbit-hole to start thinking of so no</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.560" end="00:25:15.320" style="s2">acid didn&#39;t really give me these</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.450" end="00:25:16.850" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.320" end="00:25:19.250" style="s2">yes it gave me a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.850" end="00:25:24.110" style="s2">questions which were really useful but</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.250" end="00:25:26.450" style="s2">not great for parties but the general</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:28.250" style="s2">philosophy right of like question</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.450" end="00:25:30.140" style="s2">everything like if there is a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.250" end="00:25:32.900" style="s2">you haven&#39;t looked at like go look at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.140" end="00:25:35.180" style="s2">and like figure out I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.900" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">lot more skill in figuring out the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.180" end="00:25:39.950" style="s2">question to ask for yourself then there</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:42.110" style="s2">is to answer it like if you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.950" end="00:25:44.450" style="s2">out the question to ask then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.110" end="00:25:45.650" style="s2">direction to move and and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.450" end="00:25:47.510" style="s2">know the question to ask what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.650" end="00:25:50.510" style="s2">full of answers and then you&#39;re stagnant</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.510" end="00:25:52.730" style="s2">so I think like that philosophy of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.510" end="00:25:55.370" style="s2">the question is the movement and not</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.730" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">necessarily the answer it really like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.370" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">lends itself to the philosophy pascoal</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.300" end="00:26:04.940" style="s2">excellent thank you it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.470" end="00:26:07.670" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.940" end="00:26:11.050" style="s2">Michele do you want to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.670" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">and make your suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.050" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">sure hi I&#39;m so fascinated by this idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:21.020" style="s2">that you were talking about around there</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">are questions that people themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.020" end="00:26:27.260" style="s2">really love to answer but that other</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:29.420" style="s2">people don&#39;t like hearing them answer so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.260" end="00:26:31.370" style="s2">I just love to hear some examples of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.420" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">that I&#39;ve heard people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.370" end="00:26:34.970" style="s2">their own dreams is something for</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:37.340" style="s2">example that people really love to talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.970" end="00:26:39.110" style="s2">about but others hate to listen to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.340" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">wondering what the questions examples</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.110" end="00:26:45.770" style="s2">are other examples yeah so things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:47.780" style="s2">don&#39;t have good narrative arcs are one</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.770" end="00:26:50.330" style="s2">so anything that has to do with like</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.780" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">facts about your life so I need sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.330" end="00:26:56.299" style="s2">exposition so like what is your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:58.549" style="s2">X or where did you live when X so</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.299" end="00:27:00.349" style="s2">sort of think people can really it feels</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.549" end="00:27:02.659" style="s2">like meaningful to your identity be like</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.349" end="00:27:05.029" style="s2">yes that time I lived in Paris right</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.659" end="00:27:06.619" style="s2">like I am a person that lived in Paris</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.029" end="00:27:08.659" style="s2">but like nobody gives a shit because</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.619" end="00:27:11.299" style="s2">it&#39;s not a part of like a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.659" end="00:27:12.950" style="s2">narrative arc so like a lot of those</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.270" end="00:30:57.380" style="s2">this question sure so one thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:31:00.110" style="s2">noticed with really curious people is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.380" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">that they tend to be very cerebral not</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.110" end="00:31:04.340" style="s2">all the time but a lot of intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:06.679" style="s2">curious people spend a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.340" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">the realm of the abstract and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.679" end="00:31:10.970" style="s2">always curious about how do you ask</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:12.890" style="s2">questions in such a way or what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.970" end="00:31:14.929" style="s2">questions get cerebral intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.890" end="00:31:17.470" style="s2">types to speak more from their body as</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.929" end="00:31:19.940" style="s2">opposed to from their head a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.470" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">million-dollar question isn&#39;t it if I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.940" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">knew the answer to that I would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:29.780" style="s2">extremely happy</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:31.850" style="s2">but so so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve optimized</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">for that super strongly in the deck but</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.850" end="00:31:34.760" style="s2">I I know what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:36.440" style="s2">there&#39;s like questions that bring you</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.760" end="00:31:39.560" style="s2">back to the level sensation so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.440" end="00:31:42.350" style="s2">couple questions that say like away from</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.560" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">your conscious response in the gut how</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.350" end="00:31:46.540" style="s2">do you feel about X and so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:49.160" style="s2">technique another is to avoid cache</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.540" end="00:31:50.600" style="s2">responses like we mentioned earlier like</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.160" end="00:31:52.190" style="s2">if you&#39;re really smart probably you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.600" end="00:31:54.230" style="s2">thought about all the things before and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.190" end="00:31:58.070" style="s2">to like be able to throw someone off</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.230" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">like to put them in their mind into a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.070" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">spot but that hasn&#39;t been before usually</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:04.160" style="s2">that can be a little bit more genuine I</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:06.080" style="s2">don&#39;t think those answers are really</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.160" end="00:32:11.540" style="s2">that excellent because I think the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.080" end="00:32:16.780" style="s2">problem is a very hard one no easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.540" end="00:32:16.780" style="s2">answers Daniel Philip</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.170" end="00:32:22.820" style="s2">look would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.920" end="00:32:24.380" style="s2">yeah sure hey guys so my thought is</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.820" end="00:32:27.170" style="s2">since you spent a lot of time thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.380" end="00:32:28.580" style="s2">about the taxonomy of questions and like</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.170" end="00:32:30.830" style="s2">different properties that questions can</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.580" end="00:32:32.180" style="s2">have do you find yourself noticing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.830" end="00:32:34.850" style="s2">types of questions that different people</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.180" end="00:32:36.590" style="s2">ask or like you put people into like</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.850" end="00:32:38.930" style="s2">categories or bins based on like oh like</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.590" end="00:32:44.860" style="s2">this type of person like ask me these</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.930" end="00:32:49.730" style="s2">types of questions all the time yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.860" end="00:32:54.560" style="s2">maybe not like quite as like categorizes</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.730" end="00:32:56.810" style="s2">as maybe I would hope but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.560" end="00:32:58.220" style="s2">mainly noticed like the the frequency of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.810" end="00:33:00.110" style="s2">questions to answers that people give</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.220" end="00:33:02.120" style="s2">that&#39;s like the number one maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.110" end="00:33:03.560" style="s2">like outside of the question realm just</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.120" end="00:33:05.660" style="s2">in general the thing I pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.560" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">people is like how much time do they</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.660" end="00:33:10.610" style="s2">spend like inquiring versus like</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:12.730" style="s2">providing the answer to I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.610" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">tells you a huge amount about a person</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.730" end="00:33:17.690" style="s2">in regardless like types of questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously the dichotomy of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.690" end="00:33:22.910" style="s2">very simple where are you from versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:26.270" style="s2">something that&#39;s unusual but beyond like</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.910" end="00:33:29.060" style="s2">those two spectrums I can&#39;t say that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.270" end="00:33:34.100" style="s2">like actually have a better developed</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.060" end="00:33:36.100" style="s2">model for that but you record yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.100" end="00:33:37.670" style="s2">now just thinking about the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.100" end="00:33:42.260" style="s2">one could</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.670" end="00:33:45.920" style="s2">my questions at all I think for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.260" end="00:33:48.830" style="s2">there&#39;s some there&#39;s some measure of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.920" end="00:33:52.160" style="s2">depth of a question of how far down it</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.830" end="00:33:57.560" style="s2">seems to reach into just experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.160" end="00:34:01.520" style="s2">itself so some questions definitely feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.560" end="00:34:03.620" style="s2">more like surface level just like what</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.520" end="00:34:07.010" style="s2">is what is this concept referring to or</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.620" end="00:34:09.169" style="s2">something and then some questions feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.010" end="00:34:11.990" style="s2">really really deep and maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.169" end="00:34:13.580" style="s2">thing where people tend to be and tend</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.990" end="00:34:17.419" style="s2">to be of a certain level of depth in</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.580" end="00:34:24.350" style="s2">their inquiry about something that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.419" end="00:34:29.000" style="s2">first thing that came to mind okay we</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.350" end="00:34:30.620" style="s2">have a question from and John sorry if</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.000" end="00:34:34.760" style="s2">I&#39;m mispronouncing your name would you</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:44.900" style="s2">the type of questions you ask</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.700" end="00:34:47.410" style="s2">i&#39;m having done this whole process yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.900" end="00:34:50.360" style="s2">i&#39;m more easily bored at this point i</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.410" end="00:34:51.890" style="s2">don&#39;t really ask many of the ask whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.360" end="00:34:58.010" style="s2">questions anymore cuz i&#39;ve asked them so</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.890" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">many times i i&#39;m shifting slowly towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.010" end="00:35:04.780" style="s2">trying to ask questions from like my</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:07.460" style="s2">physical body as opposed to like my mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.780" end="00:35:11.480" style="s2">like I&#39;m becoming more curious about</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.460" end="00:35:14.180" style="s2">like the way that it feels to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.480" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">presence of another person and asking</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.180" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">questions that try to like let me feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:23.590" style="s2">that more clearly as opposed to like how</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:25.460" style="s2">do we like analyze you know where our</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.590" end="00:35:27.830" style="s2">philosophical positions lie although I</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.460" end="00:35:29.630" style="s2">do still like doing that quite a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.830" end="00:35:31.490" style="s2">that definitely has been the shift away</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.630" end="00:35:33.950" style="s2">from like a sort of an analytical thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.490" end="00:35:41.090" style="s2">more and towards a like a sensational</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.950" end="00:35:44.650" style="s2">thing what about you Hrothgar I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.090" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">agree with that I think similar about</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.650" end="00:35:54.799" style="s2">the being with the I&#39;m more able to in</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:59.210" style="s2">to it appropriate question in different</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.799" end="00:36:02.450" style="s2">contact and and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.210" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">viewing a question of the tool and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.450" end="00:36:09.109" style="s2">being able to sort of just come up with</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.700" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">the right tool for that for the job and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.109" end="00:36:13.279" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool because I think I</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:15.769" style="s2">almost want there to be a science of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.279" end="00:36:21.829" style="s2">inquiry I think it&#39;s it&#39;s potentially</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.769" end="00:36:24.349" style="s2">really important of what what are</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.829" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">questions what are they doing what what</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.349" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2">happens in the moment that you hear a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:33.529" style="s2">question what is it doing and then if</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:35.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever played this game maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.529" end="00:36:37.940" style="s2">just called questions where it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.720" end="00:36:40.069" style="s2">improv game where you&#39;re only allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.940" end="00:36:43.730" style="s2">respond with a question back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.069" end="00:36:46.279" style="s2">so taking that really seriously is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.730" end="00:36:50.029" style="s2">cool it results in a different state of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.279" end="00:36:55.519" style="s2">mind if you if you take it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.029" end="00:36:57.710" style="s2">you&#39;re asking genuine questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.519" end="00:36:59.930" style="s2">definitely I that feels really alive for</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.710" end="00:37:01.970" style="s2">me like the science of inquiry what is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.930" end="00:37:04.970" style="s2">question doing and how come people can</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.970" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">feel so offended just by a question I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.970" end="00:37:12.039" style="s2">think that&#39;s yeah a li you probably have</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:12.039" style="s2">a lot more to say about that than I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.670" end="00:37:19.700" style="s2">on the shock side of that yeah yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.660" end="00:37:22.279" style="s2">by pausing a question like in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.700" end="00:37:23.960" style="s2">you know I see people respond to your to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.279" end="00:37:26.589" style="s2">your polls and they&#39;re like how could</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.960" end="00:37:29.059" style="s2">she even ask this question you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.589" end="00:37:31.250" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with that what&#39;s wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.059" end="00:37:32.990" style="s2">even posing a question to the world they</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.250" end="00:37:36.230" style="s2">they&#39;re so provocative they have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.990" end="00:37:39.140" style="s2">possibility of being so enlivening for</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.230" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">people and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.140" end="00:37:42.829" style="s2">question mark at the end of it I guess</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:46.190" style="s2">it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s more than that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.829" end="00:37:48.049" style="s2">yeah this is a huge thing I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.190" end="00:37:49.160" style="s2">how many of you are up on the Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.049" end="00:37:52.789" style="s2">thing but there have been several times</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.160" end="00:37:55.609" style="s2">where the Twitter mob has like brigaded</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.789" end="00:37:57.589" style="s2">me horribly four days of hate for ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.609" end="00:37:59.240" style="s2">for Lily just a question like I think I</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.589" end="00:38:02.089" style="s2">asked a question about bestiality a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.240" end="00:38:05.600" style="s2">couple of months ago just like what how</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.089" end="00:38:07.160" style="s2">did we evolve out of liking animals</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.600" end="00:38:09.230" style="s2">or something nothing we did like where</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.160" end="00:38:11.410" style="s2">did that come from that that was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.230" end="00:38:11.410" style="s2">mistake</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.550" end="00:38:18.020" style="s2">Greg would you like to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.510" end="00:38:20.900" style="s2">and ask a question yeah I actually wrote</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.020" end="00:38:22.700" style="s2">my question just before Hrothgar said</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.900" end="00:38:25.880" style="s2">the phrase science live in Korea so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.700" end="00:38:28.970" style="s2">was kind of a funny lead-in and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.880" end="00:38:30.980" style="s2">gonna read what I wrote out light it</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.970" end="00:38:33.380" style="s2">seems like you&#39;re informally doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.980" end="00:38:36.410" style="s2">social psychology research in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.380" end="00:38:38.300" style="s2">have you studied any social psychology</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.410" end="00:38:40.130" style="s2">or other academic research either to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.300" end="00:38:42.470" style="s2">help you interpret your findings or just</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.130" end="00:38:48.680" style="s2">out of curiosity to see how what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.470" end="00:38:51.560" style="s2">observed compares to the science okay I</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.680" end="00:38:54.410" style="s2">I started doing this originally excited</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.560" end="00:38:56.030" style="s2">it was originally doing porn and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.410" end="00:38:57.890" style="s2">large following of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.030" end="00:38:59.540" style="s2">masturbating to me and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.890" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do things I say I can ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.540" end="00:39:04.610" style="s2">them questions so I like way back in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:07.100" style="s2">day started doing surveys on all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.610" end="00:39:09.230" style="s2">these men and eventually found that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.100" end="00:39:11.870" style="s2">had a whole bunch of data that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.230" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">know what to do with and then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.870" end="00:39:17.630" style="s2">found a friend to help like teach me</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:20.210" style="s2">some statistics and like what P values</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.630" end="00:39:22.340" style="s2">were and stuff like that so I&#39;m not like</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.210" end="00:39:24.080" style="s2">incredible at it but I have like some</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.340" end="00:39:31.310" style="s2">basic knowledge but that&#39;s the entirety</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.080" end="00:39:36.650" style="s2">of my education okay great</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.310" end="00:39:39.110" style="s2">first principles we have two people</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.650" end="00:39:42.650" style="s2">raising hands which is not something</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.110" end="00:39:47.770" style="s2">that usually happens but Cara do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.650" end="00:39:53.960" style="s2">want to tell us about your hand raising</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.770" end="00:39:56.390" style="s2">I was talking to the point about why</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.960" end="00:40:00.500" style="s2">people might get offended by a question</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.390" end="00:40:03.470" style="s2">and just in general from my own gut</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.500" end="00:40:05.630" style="s2">check when you ask a question it says</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.470" end="00:40:08.300" style="s2">more about you than it does about how</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.630" end="00:40:10.820" style="s2">like how like the response does about</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.300" end="00:40:14.540" style="s2">the person who&#39;s responding so like how</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.820" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">you&#39;re framing the question is a social</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.540" end="00:40:20.809" style="s2">code it&#39;s social signal to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:23.390" style="s2">another person that indicates your own</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.809" end="00:40:25.849" style="s2">boundaries and that sometimes you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.390" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">cross a person boundary by asking a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.849" end="00:40:31.690" style="s2">question I mean often you can cross a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:35.869" style="s2">person social boundary just by existing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.690" end="00:40:38.299" style="s2">so I think that it really is just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.869" end="00:40:41.809" style="s2">difference and how people have been</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.299" end="00:40:43.969" style="s2">raised some people were raised to never</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.809" end="00:40:47.079" style="s2">ask questions that will be seen and not</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.969" end="00:40:47.079" style="s2">heard thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.989" end="00:40:55.309" style="s2">and I don&#39;t have access to chat so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.609" end="00:40:56.479" style="s2">couldn&#39;t I see yeah that explains it</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.309" end="00:40:57.950" style="s2">well Thank You Ella</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.479" end="00:40:59.749" style="s2">do you have anything to say in response</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.950" end="00:41:01.430" style="s2">to that I mean that seems right like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.749" end="00:41:02.569" style="s2">think the people that get upset at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.430" end="00:41:05.180" style="s2">questions are you doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.569" end="00:41:07.729" style="s2">they&#39;re like interpreting it as like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.180" end="00:41:09.259" style="s2">threat in some way that like they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.729" end="00:41:11.509" style="s2">pattern-matching like this series of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.259" end="00:41:14.690" style="s2">words on to other people who have used</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.509" end="00:41:15.890" style="s2">those as war in the past which makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.690" end="00:41:20.650" style="s2">sense so I think you&#39;re totally right</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.890" end="00:41:22.759" style="s2">about that car great and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.650" end="00:41:26.359" style="s2">Miriam would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.759" end="00:41:29.029" style="s2">question yes so I&#39;m talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.359" end="00:41:31.969" style="s2">willingness to even answer a question</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.029" end="00:41:33.229" style="s2">this whole asshole game reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.969" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">the work of Johnson Hite who</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.229" end="00:41:37.369" style="s2">investigated universal moral foundations</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:38.709" style="s2">and they would go around asking very</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.369" end="00:41:41.959" style="s2">uncomfortable questions and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.709" end="00:41:44.569" style="s2">cataloging the types of responses but in</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.959" end="00:41:46.279" style="s2">this case it seems like we could open up</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.569" end="00:41:49.670" style="s2">a new area of research to catalogue</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.279" end="00:41:52.969" style="s2">who&#39;s even willing to answer and what</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.670" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">personality characteristics guide that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.969" end="00:42:01.449" style="s2">behavior I think this is like like a new</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:42:01.449" style="s2">sphere of in Korea so not a question</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.869" end="00:42:07.009" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.309" end="00:42:08.329" style="s2">that a lot of people will answer the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.009" end="00:42:10.759" style="s2">question without answering the question</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.329" end="00:42:13.279" style="s2">so you can even get people to like</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.759" end="00:42:14.660" style="s2">engage but if you just pay attention you</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.279" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">realize they&#39;re not actually giving an</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.660" end="00:42:17.989" style="s2">answer and I think like that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:20.890" style="s2">probably is really indicative of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.989" end="00:42:25.630" style="s2">something you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.890" end="00:42:25.630" style="s2">great and we have a question from Rachel</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.900" end="00:42:30.850" style="s2">hi so I could offend it at one of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.910" end="00:42:42.760" style="s2">tweets and then I read your response</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.850" end="00:42:45.730" style="s2">I just became a huge fan of community um</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.760" end="00:42:47.860" style="s2">that associates with us heretics you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.730" end="00:42:49.900" style="s2">know and that&#39;s more involved in like a</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.300" end="00:44:20.890" style="s2">set of concepts like duty should</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.310" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">obligation and deserving or ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.890" end="00:44:29.470" style="s2">more valid or meaningless meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:32.740" style="s2">they&#39;re like like an incomplete term you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.470" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">know how sometimes you have terms I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.740" end="00:44:36.940" style="s2">gonna try to make this short I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:40.210" style="s2">myself strategy to talk a lot but like</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.940" end="00:44:43.710" style="s2">but I was religious I believe in these</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.210" end="00:44:46.300" style="s2">words that seemed real like like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.710" end="00:44:48.220" style="s2">theological words like the hypostatic</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.300" end="00:44:49.900" style="s2">Union for example and this was very real</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.220" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">to me and then once I left the faith I</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.900" end="00:44:53.140" style="s2">realized that it was a word that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:55.060" style="s2">actually wasn&#39;t attached to anything but</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.140" end="00:44:58.360" style="s2">it was useful in the context and I so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.060" end="00:45:01.330" style="s2">think like moral duty etc is are also a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.360" end="00:45:03.460" style="s2">set of concepts that are like useful</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.330" end="00:45:06.040" style="s2">into the sort of religious framework of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.460" end="00:45:09.780" style="s2">morality but like ultimately don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.040" end="00:45:09.780" style="s2">actually mean anything it&#39;s just wind</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.990" end="00:45:17.790" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.020" end="00:45:20.770" style="s2">wait can you repeat the question -</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.790" end="00:45:23.830" style="s2">totally do you believe the set of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.770" end="00:45:26.200" style="s2">concepts like duty should obligation and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.830" end="00:45:32.740" style="s2">deserving are ultimately more valid or</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.200" end="00:45:34.450" style="s2">meaningless hmm so I I I guess I&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.740" end="00:45:37.510" style="s2">the other positions just so we have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.450" end="00:45:39.940" style="s2">interesting contrast I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.510" end="00:45:42.330" style="s2">sense in which those concepts are</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.940" end="00:45:45.070" style="s2">referring to something that&#39;s very real</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.330" end="00:45:51.250" style="s2">and it might not be real in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.070" end="00:45:52.840" style="s2">is originally understood so certainly if</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.250" end="00:45:56.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a should or a duty or an</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.840" end="00:46:00.370" style="s2">obligation it&#39;s it&#39;s a self thing so</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.950" end="00:46:02.860" style="s2">when I have should its very self as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.370" end="00:46:06.820" style="s2">force that&#39;s like pushing or pulling me</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.860" end="00:46:08.950" style="s2">towards something probably because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.820" end="00:46:09.910" style="s2">afraid of what will happen if I if it</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.950" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.910" end="00:46:17.289" style="s2">should says it should but then we get</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:22.420" style="s2">into a territory where we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.289" end="00:46:24.819" style="s2">about sort of how how morality is based</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.420" end="00:46:28.089" style="s2">in sensation or something rather than</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.819" end="00:46:32.190" style="s2">like the the moral code who are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.089" end="00:46:32.190" style="s2">satisfying God or something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:48.460" style="s2">interesting any response Eila definitely</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.950" end="00:46:49.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve only got like about ten more</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.460" end="00:46:51.849" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.000" end="00:46:55.960" style="s2">let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any really like</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.849" end="00:46:57.670" style="s2">biting questions from the chat and if</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.960" end="00:46:59.799" style="s2">not I will just pick another question</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.670" end="00:47:03.750" style="s2">and we&#39;ll keep going oh we do have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.799" end="00:47:06.910" style="s2">follow-up question to the sex worker</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.750" end="00:47:12.099" style="s2">question grace would you like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.910" end="00:47:14.740" style="s2">your question yeah like I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.099" end="00:47:20.250" style="s2">how you made sense or how you make sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.740" end="00:47:20.250" style="s2">of the other sex workers targeting me I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.609" end="00:47:26.170" style="s2">like how simple that question was I like</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.890" end="00:47:35.049" style="s2">how like it was very concise and like</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.170" end="00:47:36.279" style="s2">just the right night level of bake so</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.049" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">like I try and think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.279" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">demographic so it&#39;s like what makes sex</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.950" style="s2">workers more likely or at least like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">same amount of likely maybe I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.950" end="00:47:45.460" style="s2">more exposed to them and so I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:48.130" style="s2">likely to experience pushback from any</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.460" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">group that I&#39;m more exposed to so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.130" end="00:47:53.380" style="s2">possible that this is not unique to sex</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">workers at all but if it is then like my</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.380" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">theory read the chat thing is that like</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:02.710" style="s2">sex workers tend to like require like</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:04.660" style="s2">more intense social signaling in some</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.710" end="00:48:07.150" style="s2">way or like more intensive in group</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.660" end="00:48:09.460" style="s2">circling because like they&#39;re subject to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.150" end="00:48:12.220" style="s2">accept pressures and they also seem to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.460" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">be like really liberal and I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.220" end="00:48:15.579" style="s2">don&#39;t really have anything against</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:17.859" style="s2">liberalism in general but there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.579" end="00:48:19.630" style="s2">kind of brand of liberal that feels very</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.859" end="00:48:22.240" style="s2">like identity driven and very</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.630" end="00:48:23.770" style="s2">performative and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:26.110" style="s2">like the sex workers I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.770" end="00:48:27.790" style="s2">countered tend to be more in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.110" end="00:48:29.320" style="s2">direction like they tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.790" end="00:48:31.030" style="s2">performative Lee liberal which might</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.320" end="00:48:33.010" style="s2">make sense because it get aligns with</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.030" end="00:48:38.770" style="s2">the sort of the ideology of sex work</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.010" end="00:48:40.900" style="s2">which I am very Pro obviously so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.770" end="00:48:43.270" style="s2">so so me making sense of it is usually</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.900" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">just trying to think of like what are</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.270" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">the reasons for why it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">like this selection seems to not like me</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.410" end="00:48:58.690" style="s2">yeah can I just follow up on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.350" end="00:49:00.490" style="s2">of course so I understand you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.690" end="00:49:03.160" style="s2">to make sense of why they&#39;re targeting</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.490" end="00:49:05.770" style="s2">you is that what I&#39;m hearing I think so</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.160" end="00:49:09.430" style="s2">and so I&#39;m wondering have you made any</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.770" end="00:49:15.490" style="s2">sense from it you you understand what</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.430" end="00:49:17.140" style="s2">does you understand of why they do it so</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.490" end="00:49:19.150" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a there&#39;s like a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.140" end="00:49:20.890" style="s2">different question between why do people</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.150" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">get upset at me in general and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.890" end="00:49:25.930" style="s2">slightly different answer than why are</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:27.880" style="s2">sex workers tending to get mad at me and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.930" end="00:49:29.770" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that those two answers</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.880" end="00:49:31.600" style="s2">overlay a lot so like for example people</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.770" end="00:49:33.790" style="s2">get upset at me is because they</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.600" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">interpret my questions as meaning a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.790" end="00:49:37.000" style="s2">thing that they don&#39;t for example and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:38.620" style="s2">it&#39;s possible this is the explanation</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.000" end="00:49:41.050" style="s2">that explains why sex workers don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.620" end="00:49:43.210" style="s2">me also like 90% of it does this answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.050" end="00:49:45.310" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying or is a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.210" end="00:49:46.780" style="s2">thing yeah what I&#39;m hearing is you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.310" end="00:49:49.510" style="s2">trying to make sense of it you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.780" end="00:49:52.530" style="s2">to help me understand your sense making</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.510" end="00:49:55.290" style="s2">of it that there isn&#39;t that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.530" end="00:50:03.070" style="s2">black and white binary announcer here</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.290" end="00:50:05.770" style="s2">that&#39;s correct okay thank you great</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.070" end="00:50:08.590" style="s2">thank you for that question grace and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.770" end="00:50:10.210" style="s2">let&#39;s see here is there anything that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.590" end="00:50:12.520" style="s2">you all really want to share with us</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.210" end="00:50:15.850" style="s2">about a school like things that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.520" end="00:50:18.790" style="s2">you&#39;ve come to understand by endeavoring</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.850" end="00:50:20.380" style="s2">on this process I mean anything that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.790" end="00:50:32.200" style="s2">comes to mind this would be a great time</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.380" end="00:50:34.460" style="s2">to share that silence non-starter wrong</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.200" end="00:50:38.210" style="s2">phrasing</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.460" end="00:50:44.270" style="s2">I hit that sweet middle grounds I know</p>

<p begin="00:50:54.440" end="00:51:00.560" style="s2">of people that you don&#39;t usually see</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.160" end="00:51:12.980" style="s2">which is just fun and silly kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:17.089" style="s2">thing this is more like let&#39;s cut into</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:58.910" style="s2">gonna ask you one more last question and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:52:01.460" style="s2">then we&#39;ll wrap up the session and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.910" end="00:52:04.670" style="s2">will move on to actually playing a skull</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.460" end="00:52:06.470" style="s2">which everybody is totally invited to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.670" end="00:52:11.300" style="s2">join us for this for the second hour a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.470" end="00:52:14.180" style="s2">second hour here how about this one on</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.300" end="00:52:16.940" style="s2">Planet a everyone&#39;s 30% dumber and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.180" end="00:52:19.580" style="s2">you&#39;re a genius by comparison on Planet</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.940" end="00:52:22.730" style="s2">B everyone&#39;s 30% smarter and you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.580" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">idiot by comparison you stay the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.730" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">which planet would you prefer to live on</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.070" end="00:52:32.869" style="s2">it&#39;s just horrible it&#39;s horrible to</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.359" end="00:52:35.210" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.869" end="00:52:39.619" style="s2">it&#39;s not fair to other people that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.210" end="00:52:42.050" style="s2">put this in the deck you go first</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.619" end="00:52:47.140" style="s2">well I think about the answer yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.050" end="00:52:47.140" style="s2">think I&#39;d rather be an idiot and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.790" end="00:52:52.920" style="s2">I find that over time I try to surround</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.370" end="00:52:56.940" style="s2">myself more and more with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.920" end="00:53:00.090" style="s2">really smart and so planet whichever one</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.940" end="00:53:01.770" style="s2">it was say or be the one where I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.090" end="00:53:04.290" style="s2">idiot seems like a natural extension of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.770" end="00:53:07.650" style="s2">that and as long as like granted that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.290" end="00:53:11.360" style="s2">can get over my own problems with</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.650" end="00:53:13.560" style="s2">feeling stupid which seems possible then</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.360" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">that would be a great planet to be on</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.560" end="00:53:19.830" style="s2">and also assuming that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:21.840" style="s2">live there aren&#39;t apples which is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.830" end="00:53:24.330" style="s2">another question yeah that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.840" end="00:53:25.910" style="s2">smartness and not being an asshole or</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.330" end="00:53:28.170" style="s2">two different things</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.910" end="00:53:31.340" style="s2">yeah it really feels like the trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.170" end="00:53:37.980" style="s2">is between like can you handle the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.340" end="00:53:40.740" style="s2">emotional hit of being the stupidest for</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.980" end="00:53:43.770" style="s2">I know if a world where everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.740" end="00:53:46.050" style="s2">30% smarter sounds really great like</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.770" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">things will get fixed and run smoother</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.050" end="00:53:51.690" style="s2">we&#39;d have fewer problems so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:55.110" style="s2">trade-off and I think I I think I want</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.690" end="00:53:57.600" style="s2">to be the person that takes the stupid</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.110" end="00:53:59.370" style="s2">being stupid and I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.600" end="00:54:03.390" style="s2">actually am that person it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.370" end="00:54:09.630" style="s2">tell because I&#39;m blinded by desire great</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.390" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">honest answer great okay well let us</p>
