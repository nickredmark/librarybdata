<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of things that come up</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.380" end="00:01:14.290" style="s2">John Vevey keys framework of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:17.500" style="s2">realization and salience landscaping in</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.290" end="00:01:21.430" style="s2">the mind of the addict your salience</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.430" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">what is relevant is that which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.800" end="00:01:29.320" style="s2">relevant to your addiction to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:31.510" style="s2">servicing of your addiction and so all</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.320" end="00:01:34.030" style="s2">of the other stuff in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.510" end="00:01:35.530" style="s2">volumes turned down on that and all the</p>

<p begin="00:01:38.050" end="00:01:47.380" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s profoundly distorting of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.759" end="00:01:50.890" style="s2">one&#39;s perception of reality and so one&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.670" end="00:02:17.290" style="s2">distortion of reality as something</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.350" end="00:02:19.900" style="s2">heightened or privileged by addiction it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.290" end="00:02:22.120" style="s2">could be just a system of prioritization</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.900" end="00:02:25.330" style="s2">because priorities also distort reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.120" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">is distort the volume that we put on</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.650" end="00:02:39.019" style="s2">addiction is being linked to certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.049" end="00:02:41.859" style="s2">forms of behavior and quite useful there</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.019" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">is a correlation that&#39;s been made with</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.859" end="00:02:50.350" style="s2">behavior like gambling on the stock</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:54.210" style="s2">exchange and addiction and those</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.350" end="00:02:56.890" style="s2">physical rewards that one gets when</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.210" end="00:02:59.650" style="s2">engaged in certain behaviors that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.890" end="00:03:01.750" style="s2">that even certain legitimized forms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.650" end="00:03:05.050" style="s2">distortion are incorporated into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.750" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">system like stock markets and stock</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.050" end="00:03:16.330" style="s2">exchange yeah Gadwal masse defines</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:22.740" style="s2">addiction as any behavior which provides</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.330" end="00:03:26.710" style="s2">Solace or comfort and which cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.740" end="00:03:29.830" style="s2">stopped even when one realizes it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.710" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">having detrimental effects on one&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.830" end="00:03:36.910" style="s2">and so he sees it as usually a response</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.360" end="00:03:40.900" style="s2">to trauma right it&#39;s a self-medicating</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.910" end="00:03:43.870" style="s2">or self-tanners self palliating response</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.900" end="00:03:47.830" style="s2">to trauma which then becomes a thing in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.870" end="00:03:51.970" style="s2">and of itself to be serviced so you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.830" end="00:03:54.100" style="s2">rooted often in healing right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.970" end="00:03:58.330" style="s2">something which begins as self-healing</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.100" end="00:04:02.500" style="s2">and then gets away gets away from you</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.330" end="00:04:04.840" style="s2">after that and so the the truth of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.500" end="00:04:09.210" style="s2">addiction actually changes over time</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.840" end="00:04:12.240" style="s2">right it starts off as a legitimate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.210" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">functional adaptive response to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.240" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">circumstance in the environment but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">because the trauma is never dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:25.210" style="s2">and healed the solution to it is held on</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.180" end="00:04:32.020" style="s2">some becomes a trauma in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:34.210" style="s2">kind of thing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.020" end="00:04:37.300" style="s2">to one&#39;s life what happens if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.210" end="00:04:42.009" style="s2">detriment to someone else&#39;s life that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.300" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">an indirect proximity and going back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.009" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">that idea of the gambling on the stock</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.990" end="00:04:48.940" style="s2">exchange it may not actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:51.009" style="s2">detriment on my own life it may be</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.940" end="00:04:53.650" style="s2">having a huge detriment to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.009" end="00:04:56.650" style="s2">other people but it has a dissociative</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.650" end="00:04:58.509" style="s2">element that allows it to then take</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.650" end="00:05:02.139" style="s2">place because the detriment isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.509" end="00:05:06.430" style="s2">directly fed into my own seeing of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.139" end="00:05:10.569" style="s2">world and so I incorporate that into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.430" end="00:05:13.620" style="s2">valid form of behavior a reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.569" end="00:05:13.620" style="s2">acceptable to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.380" end="00:05:21.330" style="s2">the counter-argument that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.060" end="00:05:23.350" style="s2">it is actually detrimental to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.330" end="00:05:25.180" style="s2">individual&#39;s life they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:27.490" style="s2">realize it right because they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.180" end="00:05:29.350" style="s2">trapped in their delusion and so what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.490" end="00:05:31.570" style="s2">is actually doing is blocking them from</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.350" end="00:05:33.940" style="s2">having relationships with their family</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.570" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">and their friends and appreciating the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.940" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">world for what it is and bla bla bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:38.310" style="s2">bla</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:40.540" style="s2">so they although they may not be</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.310" end="00:05:42.640" style="s2">immediately aware of and connected to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.540" end="00:05:47.110" style="s2">the detriment it is still doing that if</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.640" end="00:05:51.030" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s an addiction yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.110" end="00:05:51.030" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.449" end="00:05:57.629" style="s2">truth and addiction is a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.069" end="00:05:59.939" style="s2">interesting one because truth is the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.629" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">out of addiction right and addiction</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.939" end="00:06:07.770" style="s2">clouds one&#39;s ability to perceive truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:19.919" style="s2">so they are inextricably linked in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.770" end="00:06:23.969" style="s2">sense this view of detriment to oneself</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.919" end="00:06:26.249" style="s2">as being something that is because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.969" end="00:06:29.909" style="s2">affects the fabric of our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.249" end="00:06:33.270" style="s2">of social relationships is fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.909" end="00:06:36.210" style="s2">because it can&#39;t be sufficient to divine</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.270" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">define addiction because otherwise any</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.210" end="00:06:42.020" style="s2">antisocial behavior could be defined as</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:44.339" style="s2">addictive if it&#39;s become a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.020" end="00:06:47.339" style="s2">addiction there needs to be a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.339" end="00:06:53.729" style="s2">strong compulsion that pushes you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.339" end="00:06:58.469" style="s2">towards something and it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.729" end="00:07:00.449" style="s2">not sure about all of that and then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.469" end="00:07:02.159" style="s2">link to truth again it&#39;s this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.449" end="00:07:05.669" style="s2">distortion and truth and how much</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.159" end="00:07:07.949" style="s2">distortion actually equivalent some form</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.669" end="00:07:14.009" style="s2">of questioning our reality or being</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.949" end="00:07:16.680" style="s2">acceptable as a distortion compulsion is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.009" end="00:07:21.569" style="s2">definitely a part of it definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.680" end="00:07:23.939" style="s2">part of that inability to not engage in</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.569" end="00:07:27.930" style="s2">the behavior is definitely a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.939" end="00:07:30.839" style="s2">and the dopamine hit is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.930" end="00:07:34.279" style="s2">part or some kind of internal reward if</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.839" end="00:07:37.550" style="s2">not dopamine but but not some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.279" end="00:07:43.050" style="s2">internal reward which is sought</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.550" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">definitely but yeah this this this link</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.050" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">between truth and addiction feels really</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:55.709" style="s2">important because as I said before the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:58.310" style="s2">the way out of addiction is facing up to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.709" end="00:08:00.810" style="s2">the truth of it right understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.310" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">and being able to speak the truth of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.810" end="00:08:05.970" style="s2">to other people is why programs like AAA</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:08.139" style="s2">and scoob&#39;s are so effective</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.970" end="00:08:13.590" style="s2">because their forums for that truth to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.139" end="00:08:18.759" style="s2">be expressed it&#39;s almost as if you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.590" end="00:08:20.590" style="s2">these constructed maps of our world one</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.759" end="00:08:23.410" style="s2">of them which is fueled by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.590" end="00:08:26.169" style="s2">compulsion and dopamine or whichever</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.410" end="00:08:30.190" style="s2">reward system is in place and the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.169" end="00:08:33.909" style="s2">which has some form of externally</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.190" end="00:08:38.620" style="s2">validated truth and the two plashing so</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.909" end="00:08:41.320" style="s2">how to distinguish between how big that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.620" end="00:08:43.750" style="s2">difference has to be for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.320" end="00:08:46.510" style="s2">socially acceptable or not for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.750" end="00:08:49.270" style="s2">detrimental or not and that&#39;s where all</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.510" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">the fine lines come in of when someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.270" end="00:08:53.410" style="s2">actually believes that they have an</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:55.270" style="s2">addiction or not is how much it affects</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.410" end="00:08:57.910" style="s2">the reading we have of the trees how</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.270" end="00:09:00.520" style="s2">important this notion of the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.910" end="00:09:02.830" style="s2">becoming in relationship to this one it</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.520" end="00:09:06.970" style="s2">is maybe externally pacted and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.830" end="00:09:08.709" style="s2">more socially constructed it does</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.970" end="00:09:12.370" style="s2">socially value I like that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.709" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">socially validated truth I like does</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.370" end="00:09:17.140" style="s2">that make it any more true though just</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:19.029" style="s2">because it&#39;s socially validated I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.140" end="00:09:21.850" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a trap as well</p>

<p begin="00:09:21.850" end="00:09:26.620" style="s2">things as more true than your truth</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.730" end="00:09:29.589" style="s2">simply because more people believe it to</p>
