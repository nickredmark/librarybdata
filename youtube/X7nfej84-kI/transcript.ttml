<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">scientist published work in economics</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.000" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">epidemiology and he has worked in</p>

<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">is going to talk a little bit we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.390" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">gonna discuss first the economic</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">consequences of lockdowns economic and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">social consequences of lockdowns i.e</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">that is not caused free to do lock downs</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">and some ideas brian has on how to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">us out of lockdown as soon as possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">so Brian let&#39;s start with the costs of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">lockdowns economic social other okay so</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:20.610" style="s2">I went and looked for examples of big</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">drops in GDP such as we&#39;ve seen during</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.610" end="00:01:28.520" style="s2">this lockdown we hits four point three</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">back in April as the u.s. drop in GDP</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.520" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">and it took a year for the 2008 crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">to get down that low all of the examples</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen have been that will have</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:50.130" style="s2">been not v-shaped but l-shaped there I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">don&#39;t really like the word l because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.130" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">has it doesn&#39;t really describe it very</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:01:57.990" style="s2">well it&#39;s a step you take a step down</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">and then you you can get going at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.990" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">previous rate of growth but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:09.739" style="s2">recover what you lost so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:14.099" style="s2">is collectively worldwide we have lost a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.739" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">total of 12 GDP years</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.099" end="00:02:19.290" style="s2">which amounts to a total it&#39;s a bits</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:23.129" style="s2">business but it&#39;s held pretty steady at</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.290" end="00:02:28.469" style="s2">eight trillion per year which is a total</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.129" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2">of 96 trillion and for the u.s. itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.469" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">it&#39;s 1.8 trillion and that&#39;s a twentieth</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:40.829" style="s2">twenty one point six almost twenty two</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:44.669" style="s2">GDP years which is equivalent to in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.829" end="00:02:48.780" style="s2">entire year&#39;s GDP since the 2008 crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.669" end="00:02:50.639" style="s2">so we have a significant GDP gross and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.780" end="00:02:53.219" style="s2">based on historical analysis we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.639" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">going to get a v-shaped recovery and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.219" end="00:02:57.689" style="s2">best we&#39;ll get a you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:03:00.030" style="s2">reestablishment to the firth of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.689" end="00:03:02.219" style="s2">previous track but from a lower base is</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.030" end="00:03:04.889" style="s2">that a way to say it so that night right</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.219" end="00:03:08.459" style="s2">and going forward from from here with</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.889" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">the coronavirus lockdown we do not know</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.459" end="00:03:13.560" style="s2">what it&#39;s going to be now I just I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:14.489" style="s2">read it an article today an interview</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.560" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">with Rubini</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.489" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">and he&#39;s predicting an l-shaped in other</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:24.359" style="s2">words a step for this and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:27.090" style="s2">gonna be deep because there are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.359" end="00:03:30.299" style="s2">a lot of outstanding consumer debt and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.090" end="00:03:34.049" style="s2">lot of that is in people who needed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.299" end="00:03:35.579" style="s2">be working continuously so he sees this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.049" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">as being as being a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.579" end="00:03:40.290" style="s2">particularly in the US yep I agree there</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:42.359" style="s2">will be a certainly a problem and we and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.290" end="00:03:46.139" style="s2">further we don&#39;t know how far down the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.359" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">down leg is on the L right it could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.139" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">it could easily be fifteen or sixteen</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:55.379" style="s2">percent not you know yes not the eight</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:57.269" style="s2">or ten percent that you&#39;re that the date</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.379" end="00:04:00.409" style="s2">is so far show so we have good an L down</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.269" end="00:04:02.699" style="s2">we get a rise up and in in previous</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.409" end="00:04:04.829" style="s2">recoveries one of the things we do know</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.699" end="00:04:07.139" style="s2">is that the ones that are most strongly</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.829" end="00:04:08.669" style="s2">affected are young people people first</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.139" end="00:04:10.469" style="s2">trying to get on the career ladder</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.669" end="00:04:12.599" style="s2">they&#39;re essentially have their heads</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.469" end="00:04:14.609" style="s2">held down for some significant period of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.599" end="00:04:17.729" style="s2">time and most the analysis shows they</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.609" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">never catch up right because because of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.729" end="00:04:22.949" style="s2">all those lost opportunities going</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:24.840" style="s2">forward that window we talked about with</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.949" end="00:04:26.770" style="s2">the step you know you&#39;re tracking at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:28.389" style="s2">same rate but you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.770" end="00:04:30.520" style="s2">your you&#39;re way below what you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.389" end="00:04:33.729" style="s2">have been so all those younger younger</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.520" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">people will not have those career tracks</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.729" end="00:04:36.909" style="s2">and then also and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:39.699" style="s2">because of the fact that Sencha Lee the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.909" end="00:04:41.560" style="s2">economy&#39;s on hold for a while the normal</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.699" end="00:04:43.210" style="s2">growth you&#39;d have in your career like so</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:45.069" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re 25 if you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.210" end="00:04:46.900" style="s2">you&#39;re rising very rapidly in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.069" end="00:04:48.699" style="s2">career in the business world but if</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.900" end="00:04:50.710" style="s2">nothing has happened nobody&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.699" end="00:04:52.659" style="s2">promoted for two years</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.710" end="00:04:55.780" style="s2">you just lost those two years and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.659" end="00:04:57.250" style="s2">never gain them back yeah all right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.780" end="00:05:00.220" style="s2">we have a that gets clear early you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.250" end="00:05:01.690" style="s2">a significant economic loss the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.220" end="00:05:06.130" style="s2">likely and I think it&#39;s reasonable the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.690" end="00:05:07.539" style="s2">l-shaped model then at best we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.130" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">back on the same growth path there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.539" end="00:05:12.370" style="s2">also social implications I know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:14.409" style="s2">talked a little bit about that lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.370" end="00:05:16.419" style="s2">seems to hit be increasing the suicide</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.409" end="00:05:18.490" style="s2">rates at least in some areas talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.419" end="00:05:21.219" style="s2">that a little bit yes yes there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.490" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">there&#39;s reports that we have had in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.219" end="00:05:27.099" style="s2">last four months roughly in the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:28.060" style="s2">of suicides that are no or suicide</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.099" end="00:05:31.180" style="s2">attempts</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.060" end="00:05:33.940" style="s2">coming to ers that normally occur in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:37.060" style="s2">full year which is an indication that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.940" end="00:05:39.130" style="s2">people are either psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.060" end="00:05:40.780" style="s2">stressed or or that they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.130" end="00:05:43.719" style="s2">economically stressed and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.780" end="00:05:47.800" style="s2">saying you know I don&#39;t want to deal</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.719" end="00:05:51.159" style="s2">with this want one of the other probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.800" end="00:05:54.090" style="s2">personally I&#39;ve been seeing a new crop</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.159" end="00:05:56.830" style="s2">of what appear to be homeless people</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.090" end="00:06:00.340" style="s2">sitting sitting around at shopping malls</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.830" end="00:06:01.719" style="s2">and things like that and the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.340" end="00:06:03.279" style="s2">they they don&#39;t look like they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.719" end="00:06:04.900" style="s2">homeless very long is you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.279" end="00:06:06.729" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re normally fed they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.900" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">look there&#39;s skin ISM weather and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.729" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">the rest of it and they&#39;re and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:14.349" style="s2">all young yeah we know an awful lot what</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:16.569" style="s2">50% of Americans approximately have less</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.349" end="00:06:19.300" style="s2">than $500 worth of liquid financial</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.569" end="00:06:21.310" style="s2">reserves and so yeah being out of work</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.300" end="00:06:22.690" style="s2">for two months even at lower than</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.310" end="00:06:24.580" style="s2">average consumption rate because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.690" end="00:06:26.680" style="s2">the only good news about this shitshow</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.580" end="00:06:29.590" style="s2">is that our consumption rates are also</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.680" end="00:06:31.419" style="s2">way down so we&#39;ve reduced our reserves</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.590" end="00:06:33.130" style="s2">less than otherwise what but still if</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.419" end="00:06:34.690" style="s2">you&#39;re if your reserves 500 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.130" end="00:06:37.839" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:40.390" style="s2">are at or near the edge right now so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.839" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">let&#39;s take both of those elements</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.390" end="00:06:46.630" style="s2">potential long-term damage the economy</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:48.460" style="s2">social costs in terms of probably mental</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.630" end="00:06:50.740" style="s2">health either first order from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.460" end="00:06:52.870" style="s2">stress of lockdown and the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.740" end="00:06:55.000" style="s2">disease and to from the economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.870" end="00:06:59.050" style="s2">consequences leading to maybe as much as</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.050" end="00:07:05.530" style="s2">the lockdown occurs so if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.830" end="00:07:08.140" style="s2">possibly going forward you know with</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.530" end="00:07:09.990" style="s2">with the the economic stress will</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.140" end="00:07:14.950" style="s2">continue and it will probably increase</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.990" end="00:07:19.720" style="s2">we have never had this kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.950" end="00:07:23.160" style="s2">dramatic job loss ever in history that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.720" end="00:07:25.780" style="s2">is correct for an uncharted territory</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.160" end="00:07:27.820" style="s2">though I do have some reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.780" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">optimistic in that if we go back to our</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.820" end="00:07:32.950" style="s2">teens Ian&#39;s analysis of the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:35.800" style="s2">failure of modern modern financial</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.950" end="00:07:38.470" style="s2">capitalism it tends to be a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.800" end="00:07:40.540" style="s2">demand as opposed to lack of supply and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.470" end="00:07:42.760" style="s2">so one thing I&#39;m looking forward that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.540" end="00:07:45.730" style="s2">may have a little bit of v-shape comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.760" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">from the fact that demand is I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.730" end="00:07:50.410" style="s2">demand has not been met for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">for instance car sales have followed by</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.410" end="00:07:56.230" style="s2">a tremendous amount of sales when this</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.650" end="00:07:58.660" style="s2">is over car sales I suspect will rebound</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.230" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">above their normal baseline for a while</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.660" end="00:08:02.410" style="s2">there may be some other categories that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:07.600" style="s2">will also rebound</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.410" end="00:08:10.750" style="s2">you know optional surgery for instance</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.600" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">will rebound afterwards but not for long</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.750" end="00:08:13.930" style="s2">and maybe not enough to produce it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:16.930" style="s2">probably not enough to produce a v-shape</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.930" end="00:08:19.330" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a Rivini says yeah there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.930" end="00:08:22.060" style="s2">be an initial you an initial u-shape</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.330" end="00:08:24.190" style="s2">start and then it&#39;ll that that will</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.060" end="00:08:27.010" style="s2">disappear and it&#39;ll just be a no yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.190" end="00:08:28.690" style="s2">okay let&#39;s take that as a given let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.010" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">just stipulate it for what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.690" end="00:08:33.520" style="s2">that the cost of lockdown are very</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:35.410" style="s2">substantial economically they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.520" end="00:08:37.990" style="s2">substantial socially in terms of impact</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.410" end="00:08:41.770" style="s2">on young people&#39;s career opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.990" end="00:08:44.130" style="s2">and they&#39;re we pay a substantial cost in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.770" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">terms of raw deaths in terms of suicide</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.130" end="00:08:51.070" style="s2">so what&#39;s the alternative at this point</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:54.130" style="s2">I should add that Brian is has</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.070" end="00:08:57.540" style="s2">experience in viral</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.130" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">scenes including having made his own</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.540" end="00:09:03.640" style="s2">coded 19 vaccine and had given it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:06.070" style="s2">himself so with that what should we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.640" end="00:09:08.500" style="s2">let me preface this by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.070" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">vaccines a little bit because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.500" end="00:09:15.940" style="s2">more than one type the original the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:19.620" style="s2">original vaccine is vaccinia which it</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.940" end="00:09:23.130" style="s2">was the smallpox vaccine which was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.620" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">serendipitous discovery that cow pox</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.130" end="00:09:29.560" style="s2">would if would infect humans and cause</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">mild disease and then those people were</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.560" end="00:09:36.280" style="s2">protected from smallpox there haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:37.840" style="s2">been very many of those going well there</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.280" end="00:09:42.010" style="s2">there&#39;s been as far as I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.840" end="00:09:45.730" style="s2">been no other such vaccine since in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.010" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">50s we started developing attenuated</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.730" end="00:09:53.560" style="s2">vaccines by passages in cell cultures</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:56.950" style="s2">and over time those would adapt to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.560" end="00:09:59.710" style="s2">cell culture and they would become mild</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.950" end="00:10:02.710" style="s2">diseases for humans that&#39;s how we got</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.710" end="00:10:05.140" style="s2">the measles vaccine that we use today</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.710" end="00:10:07.570" style="s2">that&#39;s how the original Salk vaccine was</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.140" end="00:10:11.190" style="s2">made that&#39;s also how the second so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.570" end="00:10:14.410" style="s2">second vaccine was made that followed it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.190" end="00:10:18.190" style="s2">the problem with that type of vaccine is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.410" end="00:10:20.050" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a black box and back then</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.190" end="00:10:24.040" style="s2">we didn&#39;t do sequencing we didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.050" end="00:10:28.090" style="s2">know how far it was away so a vaccine of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.040" end="00:10:31.000" style="s2">that type could potentially revert to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.090" end="00:10:34.360" style="s2">virulence and the Salk vaccine did that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.000" end="00:10:36.370" style="s2">in a very small number of cases so it we</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.360" end="00:10:39.010" style="s2">stopped using that we created</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.370" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">regulations to deal with that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.010" end="00:10:45.220" style="s2">situation we haven&#39;t updated them since</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">since then we&#39;ve we&#39;ve learned the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.220" end="00:10:51.010" style="s2">structure of DNA we&#39;ve learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">sequence rapidly we we can get the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.010" end="00:10:57.730" style="s2">sequence for a new disease once we</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:11:01.300" style="s2">identify it pretty quickly the SARS CoV</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.730" end="00:11:04.830" style="s2">2 vaccine the Wuhan strain was sequenced</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.300" end="00:11:07.410" style="s2">and posted by the 10th of January and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.830" end="00:11:10.110" style="s2">today we can use</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:12.800" style="s2">data to rationally design vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.110" end="00:11:16.259" style="s2">because we also understand the genes of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.800" end="00:11:18.810" style="s2">viruses much better so so we can go in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.259" end="00:11:22.579" style="s2">and we can look at that and we can make</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.810" end="00:11:25.139" style="s2">decisions now there are several kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.579" end="00:11:28.860" style="s2">nonliving vaccines and non-living</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.139" end="00:11:31.709" style="s2">vaccines are inherently safer because</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.860" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to cause disease</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.709" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">they&#39;re safe for immunocompromised</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">people and the the the original ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:44.819" style="s2">were killed vaccines that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:49.079" style="s2">the current influenced your li influenza</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.819" end="00:11:50.939" style="s2">vaccine is it&#39;s a killed vaccine so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.079" end="00:11:54.420" style="s2">I&#39;m going what I&#39;m going to propose is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.939" end="00:11:57.389" style="s2">really an expansion and version of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.420" end="00:12:00.120" style="s2">we already do every year to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.389" end="00:12:02.550" style="s2">influenza the next step from kill</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.120" end="00:12:05.850" style="s2">vaccines is you can you can take</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.550" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">components of the virus the proteins and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.850" end="00:12:10.829" style="s2">you can combine those with adjuvant and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:14.040" style="s2">inject those and those will create an</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.829" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">immune response they are pretty good at</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.040" end="00:12:18.660" style="s2">generating antibody responses they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:23.490" style="s2">fair depending on the claim of adjuvant</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.660" end="00:12:27.509" style="s2">at generating cd8 responses cd8 T cells</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.490" end="00:12:29.220" style="s2">are what clears a virus infection there</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.509" end="00:12:31.949" style="s2">have been studies done in mice where if</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.220" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">you if you don&#39;t have the cd8 s-- you</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.949" end="00:12:37.740" style="s2">can have any amount of antibodies those</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:39.449" style="s2">mice will die they&#39;ll die more slowly</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.740" end="00:12:41.639" style="s2">the more antibodies they have but they</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.449" end="00:12:43.589" style="s2">will still die because you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.639" end="00:12:45.649" style="s2">rid of the factories that are producing</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.589" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">the virus in order to defeat it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.649" end="00:12:54.630" style="s2">that&#39;s what cd8 t-cells do the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:56.519" style="s2">modern type of vaccine are nucleotide</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.630" end="00:12:59.309" style="s2">vaccines of which there are two kinds</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.519" end="00:13:03.329" style="s2">there&#39;s DNA vaccines which were invented</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.309" end="00:13:05.939" style="s2">in the late 80s early 90s and I did a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.329" end="00:13:08.519" style="s2">year of my graduate school work with</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.939" end="00:13:11.069" style="s2">Gary Rhodes who was the inventor of DNA</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.519" end="00:13:14.910" style="s2">vaccines one of the things we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.069" end="00:13:18.689" style="s2">was how he had never seen and basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.910" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">if you keep the design straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.689" end="00:13:24.250" style="s2">you know keep it simple</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:27.370" style="s2">you code for proteins that are there in</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.250" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">the virus natively without modifying</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.370" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">them or if you modify them very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:34.990" style="s2">little very little you will get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:37.300" style="s2">successful vaccine he had never seen an</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.990" end="00:13:41.019" style="s2">instance where this didn&#39;t work with DNA</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.300" end="00:13:43.930" style="s2">vaccines in this century we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.019" end="00:13:47.500" style="s2">developed RNA vaccines as as a</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.500" end="00:13:54.579" style="s2">they developed the technology we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:57.790" style="s2">create RNA vaccines and roll them out as</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.579" end="00:14:01.500" style="s2">fast as we can DNA vaccines but we we</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.790" end="00:14:04.870" style="s2">can manufacture them much more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.500" end="00:14:08.680" style="s2">you can manufacture on a tabletop for</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.680" end="00:14:13.240" style="s2">millions of doses which makes it some</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.709" end="00:14:17.709" style="s2">which means that you&#39;ve got something</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.240" end="00:14:19.959" style="s2">there that scales well for roll out DNA</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.709" end="00:14:21.670" style="s2">vaccines at this point</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.959" end="00:14:27.430" style="s2">nobody&#39;s figure out how to make them</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.670" end="00:14:31.270" style="s2">scale as well my my vaccine was a DNA</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.430" end="00:14:32.829" style="s2">type vaccine I probably designed it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.270" end="00:14:34.899" style="s2">around the same time Moderne was</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.899" end="00:14:42.490" style="s2">they had a an application into the FDA</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.820" end="00:14:45.089" style="s2">by early February and they got approved</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.490" end="00:14:50.920" style="s2">for a clinical trial in early March I</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:04.870" style="s2">those up you know it&#39;s certainly safe</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.980" end="00:15:06.690" style="s2">which is you know what we expected</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.870" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.690" end="00:15:11.829" style="s2">reason to think that you wouldn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:16.089" style="s2">safe vaccine it appears to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.829" end="00:15:18.579" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to well III have exposed</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.089" end="00:15:22.839" style="s2">myself multiple times to people who were</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.579" end="00:15:26.769" style="s2">diagnosed as sick with Kovan 19 I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.839" end="00:15:29.320" style="s2">not gotten symptoms that is of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.769" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">not in itself approved because some</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.320" end="00:15:33.130" style="s2">people a lot of people on the label that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:34.149" style="s2">population don&#39;t get symptoms but I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.130" end="00:15:36.490" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.149" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">the high-risk category at my age and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.490" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">because I have asthma and have had it</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:44.019" style="s2">most of my life</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:48.430" style="s2">so with this as background what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.019" end="00:15:52.389" style="s2">saying is there is no reason today why</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.430" end="00:15:57.249" style="s2">we aren&#39;t rolling out vaccines like</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.389" end="00:16:01.660" style="s2">maderas vaccine right away and do it as</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.249" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">a rolling as a roll out trial you</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.660" end="00:16:06.370" style="s2">monitor it you look at it but you always</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:10.059" style="s2">evaluate it from the point of view of we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.370" end="00:16:13.209" style="s2">have a disaster here essentially it</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.059" end="00:16:15.309" style="s2">should be wartime rules not the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.209" end="00:16:17.949" style="s2">rules you have when you&#39;re assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.309" end="00:16:20.920" style="s2">everything has to be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.949" end="00:16:24.029" style="s2">perfected and all the t&#39;s crossed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.920" end="00:16:26.439" style="s2">all the eyes done it because for</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.029" end="00:16:29.050" style="s2">vaccines particularly for vaccines that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.439" end="00:16:32.709" style="s2">aren&#39;t alive there&#39;s very little reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.050" end="00:16:35.249" style="s2">and to to think that there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.709" end="00:16:37.930" style="s2">a serious problem particularly in adults</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.249" end="00:16:39.639" style="s2">now we had a previous conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.930" end="00:16:42.550" style="s2">this topic a little side conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.639" end="00:16:45.249" style="s2">and I was kind of surprised by the data</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.550" end="00:16:49.300" style="s2">on how many Americans have died from</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.249" end="00:16:52.050" style="s2">vaccines since 1950 that might be an</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.300" end="00:16:57.160" style="s2">interesting data yeah I do my best to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.050" end="00:17:02.319" style="s2">okay I&#39;ve done my best to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.160" end="00:17:05.260" style="s2">number and that number is below 200 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.319" end="00:17:07.630" style="s2">probably on the order of a hundred the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.260" end="00:17:12.039" style="s2">majority of the real serious casualties</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.630" end="00:17:13.929" style="s2">were in well the early ones were were</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.039" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">with the Salk vaccine there were</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.929" end="00:17:21.339" style="s2">thousands of children who got polio from</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.199" end="00:17:25.179" style="s2">it there are people who have gotten join</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.339" end="00:17:28.209" style="s2">bar syndrome which is arguable whether</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.179" end="00:17:32.039" style="s2">or not is related to vaccines there the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.209" end="00:17:35.289" style="s2">it has been accepted kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.039" end="00:17:39.580" style="s2">provisionally as possibly related to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.289" end="00:17:43.659" style="s2">vaccines but it&#39;s far more more common</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.580" end="00:17:48.430" style="s2">and likely that it was related to an</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.659" end="00:17:51.310" style="s2">actual illness with an actual virus</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.430" end="00:17:54.190" style="s2">so bottom line is the the the risks from</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.310" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">modern vaccines are in terms of deaths</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.190" end="00:18:01.500" style="s2">at least are minuscule very very low</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:18:05.470" style="s2">there was a there was a an RSV vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.500" end="00:18:09.700" style="s2">killed RSV vaccine made in the it came</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.470" end="00:18:12.520" style="s2">out in 56 which was pulled because there</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.700" end="00:18:16.470" style="s2">were some instances of children under</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.520" end="00:18:19.900" style="s2">the age of 2 who appeared to have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.470" end="00:18:24.490" style="s2">worse course of disease because they had</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.900" end="00:18:27.820" style="s2">the vaccine that wasn&#39;t true for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.490" end="00:18:30.670" style="s2">over the age of 2 so it could have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.820" end="00:18:33.640" style="s2">as with some other vaccines that could</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.670" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">have been simply not used in children of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.640" end="00:18:39.070" style="s2">that age group but that kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:42.940" style="s2">pretty darn rare you know there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.070" end="00:18:47.650" style="s2">the the you know the rest of it one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.940" end="00:18:50.380" style="s2">the interesting things about the anti</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.650" end="00:18:54.580" style="s2">vaccination people is that virtually all</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.380" end="00:18:58.540" style="s2">of what they cite is just basically made</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.580" end="00:19:02.620" style="s2">up it&#39;s not it&#39;s not real stuff or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.540" end="00:19:06.850" style="s2">wildly exaggerated so the argument is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.620" end="00:19:08.980" style="s2">that modern vaccines are relatively safe</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.850" end="00:19:12.040" style="s2">but the other half of the FDA standard</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.980" end="00:19:15.910" style="s2">for any kind of medication is that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.040" end="00:19:17.800" style="s2">also be effective how would we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.910" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">or happen or I guess we can&#39;t make sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.800" end="00:19:21.310" style="s2">that we&#39;ll be having a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:23.260" style="s2">confidence that these new start up</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.310" end="00:19:25.720" style="s2">vaccines of which there&#39;s been you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.260" end="00:19:27.340" style="s2">human trials on small numbers are</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.720" end="00:19:29.050" style="s2">actually effective we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.340" end="00:19:31.090" style="s2">vaccinate a whole bunch of people with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.050" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">vaccine that doesn&#39;t provide actual</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.090" end="00:19:39.330" style="s2">immunity right now there are with all</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:42.670" style="s2">vaccines except one the smallpox vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.330" end="00:19:45.130" style="s2">there are there&#39;s a range of immunity</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.670" end="00:19:49.080" style="s2">that is provided by them the yearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.130" end="00:19:52.690" style="s2">influenza vaccine based on epidemiology</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.080" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s estimated that somewhere around 30</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.690" end="00:19:59.320" style="s2">percent of everyone who&#39;s vaccinated</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:20:01.920" style="s2">actually gets the flu but they get such</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.320" end="00:20:05.460" style="s2">a light case that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.920" end="00:20:08.040" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know it those people can</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.460" end="00:20:11.580" style="s2">potentially infect others for a short</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.040" end="00:20:14.670" style="s2">period of time measles vaccine which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.580" end="00:20:17.730" style="s2">even the live attenuated vaccine has had</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.670" end="00:20:23.850" style="s2">failures now some of those failures are</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.730" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">probably because of poor storage</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.850" end="00:20:30.510" style="s2">conditions the the measles vaccine is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:32.280" style="s2">the live attenuated vaccine and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.510" end="00:20:34.500" style="s2">not kept at the right temperature under</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.280" end="00:20:37.820" style="s2">the right conditions and all the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.500" end="00:20:39.990" style="s2">it it will you know it&#39;ll it&#39;ll die and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.820" end="00:20:42.870" style="s2">so you won&#39;t get an effective</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.990" end="00:20:46.200" style="s2">vaccination from that there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.870" end="00:20:48.740" style="s2">instances where there have been there</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.200" end="00:20:53.660" style="s2">there have been people who were who had</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.740" end="00:20:57.570" style="s2">the measles vaccine who were later</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.660" end="00:20:59.940" style="s2">infected by people who didn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.570" end="00:21:02.700" style="s2">and got measles and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.940" end="00:21:06.930" style="s2">spreading the virus all over now those</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.700" end="00:21:10.380" style="s2">people were protected so in vaccinology</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.930" end="00:21:14.430" style="s2">we talk about protection and we talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.380" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">about sterilization so as the goal is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.430" end="00:21:20.340" style="s2">sterilizing vaccine and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:21.870" style="s2">is that you will have not just cd8 T</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.340" end="00:21:25.290" style="s2">cells but you will have high enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.870" end="00:21:28.740" style="s2">antibody levels that if you get a normal</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.290" end="00:21:31.650" style="s2">dose of the virus you&#39;ll essentially get</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.740" end="00:21:36.270" style="s2">no no infection or there will be nothing</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.650" end="00:21:37.770" style="s2">seen and so for example in Mouse studies</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.270" end="00:21:40.020" style="s2">what they would do is they would and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.770" end="00:21:46.110" style="s2">they would expose a bunch of vaccinated</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.020" end="00:21:47.310" style="s2">mice to a virus and then two days later</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.110" end="00:21:50.010" style="s2">they would kill the mice and they would</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.310" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">look in the lungs to see if if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.010" end="00:21:56.940" style="s2">any evidence of virus in the lungs and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.470" end="00:22:00.990" style="s2">really good vaccine will have no</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.940" end="00:22:04.380" style="s2">evidence of virus in the lungs so what</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.990" end="00:22:07.590" style="s2">what we&#39;ve seen in most and most mammals</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.380" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">if you use a DNA vaccine or an RNA</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.590" end="00:22:13.230" style="s2">vaccine on them they will get a they</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:15.140" style="s2">will get a good antibody response on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.230" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">good cd8 response</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.140" end="00:22:20.420" style="s2">for reasons that are not fully</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:25.640" style="s2">understood when you inoculate primates</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.420" end="00:22:28.700" style="s2">with a DNA or RNA vaccine and we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.640" end="00:22:33.380" style="s2">primates is sometimes called the primate</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.700" end="00:22:36.770" style="s2">barrier in nucleotide vaccinology you</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.380" end="00:22:39.049" style="s2">will not get a great antibody response</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.770" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">you may get some but you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.049" end="00:22:45.020" style="s2">get a really strong one but you will get</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:47.330" style="s2">a good cd8 t-cell response so what that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.020" end="00:22:51.740" style="s2">means is that the this kind of vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.330" end="00:22:55.190" style="s2">you if is considered protective for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.740" end="00:22:59.929" style="s2">individuals who get it but it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.190" end="00:23:03.770" style="s2">sterilizing if you combine a DNA or RNA</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.929" end="00:23:07.309" style="s2">vaccine with a later component vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.770" end="00:23:10.160" style="s2">for it has a protein in it those are</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.309" end="00:23:12.610" style="s2">good at generating antibody responses</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.160" end="00:23:16.580" style="s2">and after and since the body has been</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.610" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">primed to respond by the DNA or RNA</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.580" end="00:23:22.610" style="s2">vaccine it will give you a good antibody</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:25.299" style="s2">response and something else to remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.610" end="00:23:28.669" style="s2">when when I&#39;m talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.299" end="00:23:32.179" style="s2">rollouts is that just because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.669" end="00:23:33.470" style="s2">been inoculated was one vaccine does not</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.179" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">mean you can&#39;t be inoculated with</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.470" end="00:23:38.620" style="s2">another one and that will you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.919" end="00:23:42.500" style="s2">vaccinology is full of multistage</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.620" end="00:23:44.809" style="s2">inoculations that improve the antibody</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.500" end="00:23:48.830" style="s2">response and improve the cd8 response</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.809" end="00:23:52.730" style="s2">each time something else to understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.830" end="00:23:58.460" style="s2">is that the current regulations are</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.730" end="00:24:01.460" style="s2">built around the the antibody response</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.460" end="00:24:03.650" style="s2">and this is a combination of history</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.460" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">that that was the first thing we found</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.650" end="00:24:08.690" style="s2">out about was antibodies and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:10.010" style="s2">developed antisera and horse serum and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.690" end="00:24:12.410" style="s2">all those and that was a revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.010" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">medicine but then that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.410" end="00:24:17.450" style="s2">updated and even today I run into</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:20.360" style="s2">physicians all the time who are not</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.450" end="00:24:22.970" style="s2">aware that antibodies don&#39;t cure a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.360" end="00:24:27.770" style="s2">disease that is only the cd8 t-cells to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.970" end="00:24:29.090" style="s2">do it so we have we have not yet adapted</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.770" end="00:24:33.400" style="s2">the regulations</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.090" end="00:24:35.990" style="s2">- looking at t-cell responses in people</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.400" end="00:24:40.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a harder assay it&#39;s a much harder</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.990" end="00:24:42.890" style="s2">SAT - to execute it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.520" end="00:24:45.680" style="s2">bunch more work so that that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.890" end="00:24:49.040" style="s2">more expensive but it&#39;s also the measure</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.680" end="00:24:50.120" style="s2">that really really matters for us quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.040" end="00:24:51.590" style="s2">a follow-up question though if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.120" end="00:24:55.580" style="s2">understanding you correctly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.590" end="00:24:58.580" style="s2">quite possible that I am NOT that if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.580" end="00:25:00.590" style="s2">are able to boost the cd8 t-cells</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.580" end="00:25:03.110" style="s2">we&#39;ll keep people from getting sick but</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.590" end="00:25:05.030" style="s2">we won&#39;t reach the herd immunity to keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.110" end="00:25:06.110" style="s2">it from spreading to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.030" end="00:25:11.620" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.110" end="00:25:15.290" style="s2">well that&#39;s see when you when you are</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.620" end="00:25:18.920" style="s2">conducting a vaccine campaign you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.290" end="00:25:21.680" style="s2">to get to 95 percent plus vaccination</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.920" end="00:25:25.550" style="s2">rate in order to say that you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.680" end="00:25:27.800" style="s2">effective herd immunity when a disease</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.550" end="00:25:31.220" style="s2">goes through a population you have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.800" end="00:25:33.890" style="s2">get to around 70 percent now why is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.220" end="00:25:37.430" style="s2">the reason is that the transmission</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.890" end="00:25:40.550" style="s2">networks through which viruses</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.430" end="00:25:43.100" style="s2">communicate have particular pathways</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.550" end="00:25:46.250" style="s2">they&#39;re not you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.100" end="00:25:48.770" style="s2">completely flat each person has you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.250" end="00:25:51.500" style="s2">some people have a lot of connections</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.770" end="00:25:54.710" style="s2">that they can transmit through most</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.500" end="00:26:00.170" style="s2">people have very few that&#39;s why in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.710" end="00:26:02.030" style="s2">epidemiology nowadays r0 is not really</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.170" end="00:26:03.320" style="s2">considered to be a proper measure</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.030" end="00:26:08.690" style="s2">because it&#39;s basically a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.320" end="00:26:10.040" style="s2">fiction most transmission of disease is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:12.350" style="s2">done by suit what are called super</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.040" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">spreaders and that&#39;s true in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.350" end="00:26:19.400" style="s2">in most diseases and that&#39;s true in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:21.080" style="s2">case of this SARS CoV 2 epidemic we you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.400" end="00:26:23.620" style="s2">know there are some people who transmit</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.080" end="00:26:26.390" style="s2">it to ten fifty maybe a hundred or more</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.620" end="00:26:29.030" style="s2">the median is somewhere between zero and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.390" end="00:26:32.390" style="s2">one and then when you average that all</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.030" end="00:26:34.910" style="s2">that out after the fact and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.390" end="00:26:38.090" style="s2">curve you see something that is called</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.910" end="00:26:39.710" style="s2">r0 but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.090" end="00:26:43.140" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually out there in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.710" end="00:26:46.260" style="s2">in the real world okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.140" end="00:26:48.630" style="s2">that answered the question well it not</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.260" end="00:26:50.280" style="s2">really is gonna that&#39;s aside that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.630" end="00:26:53.190" style="s2">side story cuz if you&#39;ll still get</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.280" end="00:26:56.120" style="s2">propagation presumably back I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.190" end="00:27:00.420" style="s2">your point is that it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.120" end="00:27:02.400" style="s2">well well well my point is that if</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.420" end="00:27:04.650" style="s2">you&#39;re using vaccines to stop an</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.400" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">epidemic you either have to do ring</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.650" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">vaccination or you have to get ninety</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:12.690" style="s2">five percent plus of the population</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:13.800" style="s2">immune and as an instance of that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.690" end="00:27:15.750" style="s2">don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.800" end="00:27:17.550" style="s2">currently with influenza because</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.750" end="00:27:19.290" style="s2">influenza is you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.550" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">a vaccine that everybody gets every year</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.290" end="00:27:25.890" style="s2">and so we that&#39;s one of the reasons we</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:27.890" style="s2">have you know between thirty and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.890" end="00:27:29.910" style="s2">thousand people a year dying of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.890" end="00:27:33.090" style="s2">influenza as a normal course of events</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.910" end="00:27:35.730" style="s2">because that&#39;s a pandemic that happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.090" end="00:27:39.530" style="s2">every year we don&#39;t really pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.730" end="00:27:42.510" style="s2">to it like we are with this one which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.530" end="00:27:46.410" style="s2">the same kind of thing but at a high at</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.510" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">a and a higher death rate so the point</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.410" end="00:27:52.260" style="s2">here is that what we&#39;d want to do is we</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:56.040" style="s2">want to protect initially like first</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.260" end="00:27:58.140" style="s2">responders medical personnel the elderly</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.040" end="00:28:00.810" style="s2">the people who are the most likely to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.140" end="00:28:06.180" style="s2">die to choose you to be exposed from it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.810" end="00:28:09.540" style="s2">and and potentially die and and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.180" end="00:28:12.210" style="s2">people who are risking the most after</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.540" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">that we can you know we can roll it out</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.210" end="00:28:18.210" style="s2">to anybody who wants it and that should</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:21.540" style="s2">be a huge number of people now there</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.210" end="00:28:25.410" style="s2">will be some people who won&#39;t and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.540" end="00:28:27.660" style="s2">gets so so this gets to how you can say</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.410" end="00:28:30.510" style="s2">okay we won&#39;t necessarily need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.660" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">lockdown because most people will be</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.510" end="00:28:35.460" style="s2">protected who would be the ones who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:37.860" style="s2">great at greatest risk and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.460" end="00:28:41.130" style="s2">everybody else can potentially decide</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.860" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">for themselves and and so nucleotide</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.130" end="00:28:48.450" style="s2">vaccines killed vaccines and component</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:50.700" style="s2">protein vaccines can all contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.450" end="00:28:54.410" style="s2">that pretty well and a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.700" end="00:28:57.220" style="s2">those can can do really well</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.410" end="00:29:02.060" style="s2">but if you want the most robust</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.220" end="00:29:04.550" style="s2">long-term immunity then you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.060" end="00:29:07.010" style="s2">some type of a live vaccine and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.550" end="00:29:11.920" style="s2">would be a recombinant engineered</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.010" end="00:29:16.310" style="s2">vaccine such as adenovirus with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.920" end="00:29:19.180" style="s2">spike protein attached to it or you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.310" end="00:29:22.310" style="s2">would want to try to engineer a</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.180" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">rationally engineer a an attenuated</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.310" end="00:29:26.570" style="s2">vaccine which could potentially be done</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:28.790" style="s2">with this particular virus there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.570" end="00:29:31.670" style="s2">some specific proteins that will for</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.790" end="00:29:35.810" style="s2">example there&#39;s RF 3a which produces a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.670" end="00:29:38.540" style="s2">protein that prevents the individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.810" end="00:29:40.220" style="s2">cells from producing interferon which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.540" end="00:29:42.550" style="s2">one of the reasons why this virus tends</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.220" end="00:29:45.140" style="s2">to last lasts so long because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.550" end="00:29:49.130" style="s2">stopping the body from responding to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.140" end="00:29:51.380" style="s2">as effectively so can i Reese um er eyes</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.130" end="00:29:53.540" style="s2">your strategy and and the reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.380" end="00:29:55.940" style="s2">again and correct me if I&#39;m wrong which</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.540" end="00:29:59.450" style="s2">I may well be we&#39;re paying a high cost</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.940" end="00:30:01.310" style="s2">for lockdown economically socially and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.450" end="00:30:04.630" style="s2">in broad s through things like suicide</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.310" end="00:30:08.600" style="s2">driven by both stress and economic loss</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.630" end="00:30:13.610" style="s2">modern RNA type vaccines can scale</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.600" end="00:30:17.720" style="s2">easily are very safe surprisingly so and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.610" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">are effective at at least keeping people</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.720" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">from getting sick through CDA t-cell</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:24.950" style="s2">development so therefore there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:27.860" style="s2">reason we shouldn&#39;t roll those out at</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.950" end="00:30:30.860" style="s2">scale right away presumably with least</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.860" end="00:30:33.620" style="s2">some curation on which ones go out yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.860" end="00:30:36.350" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.620" end="00:30:40.010" style="s2">have you&#39;re going to want to follow it</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.350" end="00:30:44.390" style="s2">okay as a car has a kind of trial that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.010" end="00:30:47.510" style="s2">but not you know currently as an example</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.390" end="00:30:52.700" style="s2">there was a vaccine that was produced</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.510" end="00:30:54.620" style="s2">for rotavirus by Wyeth and it had five</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.700" end="00:31:00.580" style="s2">cases of what&#39;s called intussusception</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.620" end="00:31:03.680" style="s2">in infants who had who had gotten it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.580" end="00:31:07.030" style="s2">this is a easily treatable condition</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.680" end="00:31:08.360" style="s2">it&#39;s where that where the small</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.030" end="00:31:11.240" style="s2">intestine</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.360" end="00:31:14.929" style="s2">telescopes in on itself okay and it can</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.240" end="00:31:18.980" style="s2">be a it happens pretty regularly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.929" end="00:31:21.290" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s easily treated and because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.980" end="00:31:25.429" style="s2">this why it&#39;s decided to pull the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.290" end="00:31:27.320" style="s2">vaccine which meant that there were in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.429" end="00:31:31.910" style="s2">the interim years before there was a new</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:36.280" style="s2">vaccine there were over a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.910" end="00:31:41.299" style="s2">deaths of children in the West and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.280" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">worldwide the the death toll is was over</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.299" end="00:31:46.970" style="s2">half a million during that time and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:49.070" style="s2">is and this is a readily vaccinate able</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.970" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">disease now that isn&#39;t that is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.070" end="00:31:57.110" style="s2">example of corporate liability avoidance</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:32:02.330" style="s2">because of the climate in torez vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.110" end="00:32:04.250" style="s2">at that time which was still very you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.330" end="00:32:07.870" style="s2">know the the the anti vaccine people</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.250" end="00:32:12.590" style="s2">have been astonishingly successful at</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.870" end="00:32:16.850" style="s2">peddling their their their lies and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.590" end="00:32:19.040" style="s2">juries are easily convinced so you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.850" end="00:32:21.140" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the vaccines because of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.040" end="00:32:24.440" style="s2">sort of thing so what I&#39;m getting at</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.140" end="00:32:26.660" style="s2">here is that when we do these rollouts</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.440" end="00:32:30.919" style="s2">yes we should log things but we</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.660" end="00:32:33.860" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be deciding to stop because of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.919" end="00:32:36.980" style="s2">something like on like that because of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.860" end="00:32:41.299" style="s2">something that is probably unrelated it</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.980" end="00:32:43.730" style="s2">that that that nobody in a in a military</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.299" end="00:32:45.520" style="s2">situation would would would blink an eye</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.730" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">out so I think that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.520" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">distinction yeah wartime rules we know</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:52.580" style="s2">there&#39;s some risk they&#39;re not zero but</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:54.620" style="s2">we&#39;re paying huge costs by not doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.580" end="00:32:56.120" style="s2">anything so whatever we have to do from</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.620" end="00:32:58.520" style="s2">a legal or administrative or</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.120" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">indemnification for perspective to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.520" end="00:33:03.500" style="s2">it rolling we should do that&#39;s some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:05.690" style="s2">your argument pretty well yeah with with</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.500" end="00:33:10.910" style="s2">the caveat that you know the real risk</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.690" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">is really really low um probably it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.910" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">close to zero that it is indecipherable</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:17.929" style="s2">okay well I think that&#39;s been a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:19.280" style="s2">interesting perspective very different</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.929" end="00:33:22.190" style="s2">from anything we&#39;ve heard from anybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.280" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">else either on this show</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.190" end="00:33:27.320" style="s2">in general that we should take you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.990" style="s2">some reasonably curated set of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.320" end="00:33:33.050" style="s2">vaccines and just go with it accept some</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.990" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">risk probably very tiny and get various</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.050" end="00:33:37.520" style="s2">benefits from either actual immunity or</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:39.830" style="s2">at least people not getting the disease</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.520" end="00:33:41.450" style="s2">and be able to open the economy up for</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.830" end="00:33:44.840" style="s2">probably everybody but those in a high</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.450" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">risk category and though this those two</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.840" end="00:33:48.950" style="s2">things are not different okay you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:50.780" style="s2">have immunity and still get sick this</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.950" end="00:33:54.140" style="s2">happens on a regular basis you know for</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.780" end="00:33:56.270" style="s2">example I had I had rubella twice once</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.140" end="00:33:58.820" style="s2">when I was a kid and once when I was in</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.270" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">college and the second time I got it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.820" end="00:34:06.680" style="s2">had a much lighter case of the disease</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:09.800" style="s2">but immunity does decline with time it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.680" end="00:34:12.169" style="s2">can also decline because for example if</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.800" end="00:34:16.880" style="s2">somebody gets a serious case of measles</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.169" end="00:34:21.169" style="s2">that will destroy a lot of a lot of or</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.880" end="00:34:25.910" style="s2">all of some of their populations of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.169" end="00:34:28.370" style="s2">memory T cells and memory b-cells so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.910" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">they are exposed to that virus again</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.370" end="00:34:33.020" style="s2">it&#39;s as if they had never been they had</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:35.090" style="s2">never been exposed before got it thanks</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.020" end="00:34:36.470" style="s2">for that clarification and thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.090" end="00:34:38.600" style="s2">being on the show I think people will</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.470" end="00:34:40.250" style="s2">find this an intriguing idea and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.600" end="00:34:42.200" style="s2">the idea will get out and get thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.250" end="00:34:47.370" style="s2">about seriously by those people working</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.200" end="00:34:49.610" style="s2">on on our policy so with that thanks</p>
