<p begin="00:11:23.930" end="00:11:31.700" style="s2">there&#39;s what that chronology reveals</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.890" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">about life about being that is something</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.700" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">in which you have been paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:39.020" style="s2">to yeah right and been tracking and been</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.220" end="00:11:42.140" style="s2">having conversations like these which</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.020" end="00:11:44.540" style="s2">are it&#39;s not just about like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.140" end="00:11:46.700" style="s2">frame and life happens inside of and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.540" end="00:11:48.920" style="s2">just talk about the content we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.700" end="00:11:50.330" style="s2">talk about the frame right but then</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.920" end="00:11:52.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of being in life where</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.330" end="00:11:54.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re in life and then in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.820" end="00:11:58.730" style="s2">such a way that it reveals more of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.770" end="00:12:00.410" style="s2">frame and the frame is the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.730" end="00:12:03.080" style="s2">piece that is the interesting piece</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.410" end="00:12:06.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t it yes and the frame is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.080" end="00:12:06.520" style="s2">malleable piece</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.600" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">and that changes everything right well</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.470" end="00:12:14.250" style="s2">even in even in just that statement that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:17.100" style="s2">you had which is like oh yeah going</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.250" end="00:12:20.730" style="s2">through my life with you I got in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:24.029" style="s2">sense a new history yeah right at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.730" end="00:12:26.910" style="s2">how my history my history occurred for</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.029" end="00:12:29.220" style="s2">me yeah it was really different yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.910" end="00:12:30.899" style="s2">like that but like the stick the move I</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.220" end="00:12:33.990" style="s2">talked about this a lot but like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.899" end="00:12:35.850" style="s2">movie The Sixth Sense Wilson is a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.990" end="00:12:38.819" style="s2">example he&#39;s dead the whole movie no one</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.850" end="00:12:40.350" style="s2">knows it and then he awakens to it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.819" end="00:12:42.630" style="s2">then the thing like that all the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.350" end="00:12:45.480" style="s2">watching the movie awaken to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.630" end="00:12:47.850" style="s2">it tracks back to the first scene and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.480" end="00:12:50.610" style="s2">scene by scene it goes through it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.850" end="00:12:52.620" style="s2">then it was obvious the whole time yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.610" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">but not to us</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.620" end="00:12:58.649" style="s2">yes that to me is wonder that revealing</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:01.050" style="s2">is wonder that&#39;s what yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.649" end="00:13:04.380" style="s2">meaning significance and that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.050" end="00:13:05.790" style="s2">be available you know on one level like</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.380" end="00:13:08.850" style="s2">we haven&#39;t really talked about this yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.790" end="00:13:12.060" style="s2">but like I one level that&#39;s you and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.850" end="00:13:13.500" style="s2">leading in the wisdom course and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.060" end="00:13:16.910" style="s2">that kind of stuff on some level that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.500" end="00:13:20.279" style="s2">has been at the heart that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.910" end="00:13:23.310" style="s2">right that way of looking at things to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.279" end="00:13:26.430" style="s2">reveal the frame right the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.310" end="00:13:27.930" style="s2">that&#39;s most malleable gray is has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.430" end="00:13:30.660" style="s2">at the heart of your life that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.540" end="00:14:05.290" style="s2">our conversation just even I knew this</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.790" end="00:14:08.259" style="s2">but I like what</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.190" end="00:18:01.690" style="s2">the kind of conspiracy theory fringe and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:04.360" style="s2">sometimes the fringe has a more</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.690" end="00:18:08.650" style="s2">scientific bed but they&#39;re very close</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.410" end="00:18:36.790" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to be on the front you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:39.790" style="s2">to stop giving a about belonging to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.790" end="00:18:45.330" style="s2">make any real difference or you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.790" end="00:18:50.580" style="s2">say belonging for what it is rather than</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.970" end="00:19:03.070" style="s2">want to make a difference right which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.040" end="00:19:06.850" style="s2">if we say that what you&#39;re inside of is</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.850" end="00:19:12.490" style="s2">current yeah the things that are like</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.550" end="00:19:14.920" style="s2">easy to easy to comprehend that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.490" end="00:19:17.770" style="s2">can talk about like that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.920" end="00:19:21.000" style="s2">adjust you and orient and make judgments</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.770" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">about and is if we say that&#39;s the norm</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.000" end="00:19:26.530" style="s2">and there then there&#39;s on the margins of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:28.360" style="s2">the norm as you get on the margin the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.530" end="00:19:30.310" style="s2">norm you&#39;ll have less and you&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.360" end="00:19:33.580" style="s2">less and less sense you&#39;ll be probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.310" end="00:19:35.470" style="s2">more and more threatening if if they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.580" end="00:19:36.940" style="s2">even perceive what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.470" end="00:19:39.640" style="s2">right I could receive what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.940" end="00:19:42.580" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t belong here yeah so if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.640" end="00:19:45.940" style="s2">want to make a difference almost bought</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.580" end="00:19:51.030" style="s2">by structural definition right what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.940" end="00:19:53.190" style="s2">hearing you say is I have to tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.030" end="00:20:01.160" style="s2">I need to be able to tolerate not</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.190" end="00:20:06.680" style="s2">belonging right you have the price for</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.160" end="00:20:13.080" style="s2">speaking to the mainstream is the strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.680" end="00:20:18.210" style="s2">possibility that you will be derided or</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.080" end="00:20:26.120" style="s2">ignored or thought of as weird all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.210" end="00:20:26.120" style="s2">stuff we do to deal with threat</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:38.100" style="s2">interesting interesting yeah when people</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.670" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">you&#39;re quite inexplicable your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.560" end="00:20:57.240" style="s2">for just getting inside with people and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:21:00.750" style="s2">and kind of roaming around inside other</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.240" end="00:21:03.390" style="s2">people&#39;s bodies and heads and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.750" end="00:21:06.030" style="s2">through their eyes right right you all</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.390" end="00:21:15.180" style="s2">be explanation for you is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.030" end="00:21:19.500" style="s2">weird right right totally so it&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.180" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t have that capacity and and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.500" end="00:21:22.770" style="s2">other person that other person that all</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:26.250" style="s2">these other people don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.770" end="00:21:28.560" style="s2">capacity you are weird right</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.250" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">and there&#39;s a it&#39;s also that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.560" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">oriented that way and interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:39.060" style="s2">way and then go that way is that is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">like it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s interesting cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.060" end="00:21:44.430" style="s2">like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:46.770" style="s2">so it&#39;s all I&#39;ve been one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.430" end="00:21:51.650" style="s2">about when I think about the work of and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.770" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">in philosophy let&#39;s say there&#39;s Sartre</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.650" end="00:21:56.910" style="s2">Sartre who was kind of like the one who</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.470" end="00:21:58.890" style="s2">you could say I don&#39;t know if he started</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.910" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">existential somebody but he basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.890" end="00:22:06.840" style="s2">was he was a philosopher that became</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:09.270" style="s2">popular while he would read books and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.840" end="00:22:11.910" style="s2">they actually people would buy them and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.270" end="00:22:15.140" style="s2">and it became it was in the it became</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.910" end="00:22:19.610" style="s2">popular and a lot of starches work was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.140" end="00:22:22.440" style="s2">genius misunderstanding of Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.610" end="00:22:24.810" style="s2">that was basically existentialism I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.440" end="00:22:26.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more to it than that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.810" end="00:22:28.890" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is as time goes on</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.670" end="00:22:33.060" style="s2">Sartre is becoming less and less</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.890" end="00:22:35.580" style="s2">significant yeah and it in it kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.060" end="00:22:37.410" style="s2">think I thought about that I was like</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.580" end="00:22:42.030" style="s2">wow interesting because I really like</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.410" end="00:22:43.890" style="s2">Sartre in his is some people would even</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.030" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">say that he was less than they consider</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.890" end="00:22:50.790" style="s2">him less and less a philosopher as time</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:53.040" style="s2">goes on and Heidegger is who was you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.790" end="00:22:55.740" style="s2">know who&#39;s famous relatively speaking</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.040" end="00:22:58.670" style="s2">during his time but now people are just</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.740" end="00:23:01.020" style="s2">really being able to actually comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.670" end="00:23:03.780" style="s2">or comprehended they don&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.020" end="00:23:05.370" style="s2">comprehend what he was saying and I and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.780" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">I think I think about like well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.370" end="00:23:11.430" style="s2">what that is is because he was so tuned</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:13.230" style="s2">in to what didn&#39;t have quite to a level</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.430" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t brought into language yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.230" end="00:23:21.690" style="s2">yes so what the periphery that what when</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:23.700" style="s2">he started to speak literally it was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.690" end="00:23:27.450" style="s2">unintelligible to people to even notice</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.700" end="00:23:29.550" style="s2">right in threatening and all those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.450" end="00:23:32.630" style="s2">of things and now people are just</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.550" end="00:23:35.910" style="s2">starting to be able to like metabolize</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.630" end="00:23:37.590" style="s2">the work and you&#39;re hearing of him more</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.910" end="00:23:40.740" style="s2">and then people are getting like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.590" end="00:23:45.150" style="s2">god he was speaking what we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.740" end="00:23:48.300" style="s2">inside of right yeah so like that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.150" end="00:23:50.800" style="s2">me to me the connection between that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.300" end="00:23:55.430" style="s2">authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.800" end="00:23:58.430" style="s2">yeah it is it seems to be really wedded</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.430" end="00:24:00.860" style="s2">right - yeah right this sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.430" end="00:24:03.830" style="s2">authentic isn&#39;t just about just being</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.860" end="00:24:06.710" style="s2">yourself for being different but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.830" end="00:24:10.670" style="s2">actually tuning into an intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.710" end="00:24:12.620" style="s2">that&#39;s that the that isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.670" end="00:24:15.380" style="s2">people can get together and idly talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.620" end="00:24:18.350" style="s2">about right yeah and just idle together</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.380" end="00:24:27.550" style="s2">as just as I did you would say yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.350" end="00:24:33.050" style="s2">think there&#39;s gotta be enough dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.550" end="00:24:38.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like the number of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.050" end="00:24:43.370" style="s2">dialogue have to grow and grow and grow</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.600" end="00:24:47.530" style="s2">and and that to me is a process of being</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.370" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">able to translate something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.530" end="00:24:53.900" style="s2">ephemeral I don&#39;t know if I want to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:56.840" style="s2">that word here but something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.900" end="00:25:00.170" style="s2">difficult to grasp and putting like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.840" end="00:25:04.370" style="s2">said enough language around it and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.170" end="00:25:07.670" style="s2">the language gets more commonplace I</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.370" end="00:25:10.040" style="s2">think what also happens though is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.670" end="00:25:13.340" style="s2">as the language gets more commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.040" end="00:25:19.750" style="s2">you get a little bit further away from</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.340" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">the initial impulse yep right yep</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.750" end="00:25:26.420" style="s2">totally yeah because it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:30.290" style="s2">explained it&#39;s being explained rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.420" end="00:25:34.100" style="s2">than like a blinding lightning flash of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.290" end="00:25:37.310" style="s2">illumination right totally where in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.100" end="00:25:39.050" style="s2">order to attempt to explain it the nd</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.310" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">you stumble upon your words and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.050" end="00:25:43.370" style="s2">start mumbling things that no one makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:45.110" style="s2">sense you have to be looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.370" end="00:25:48.380" style="s2">thing that&#39;s intelligible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.110" end="00:25:52.330" style="s2">speaking to you right yeah yeah once it</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.380" end="00:25:56.600" style="s2">becomes it&#39;s interesting once it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.330" end="00:25:59.000" style="s2">you know a lingo or becomes has more</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.600" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">language around it that and becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.000" end="00:26:05.460" style="s2">intelligible to what&#39;s ordinary right</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:07.860" style="s2">people start to speak it then they could</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.460" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">just repeat it without having to point</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.860" end="00:26:13.860" style="s2">look at the thing to try to try to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:17.220" style="s2">articulate some time what he called</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.860" end="00:26:19.020" style="s2">Heidegger called tranquilized obvious</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.220" end="00:26:21.380" style="s2">Ness yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.020" end="00:26:24.510" style="s2">yeah the mode of authenticity I think is</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.380" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">speech and it&#39;s in its inauthentic code</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.510" end="00:26:31.980" style="s2">right which is most most speech right</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:33.690" style="s2">well which is interesting idle talk was</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.980" end="00:26:35.909" style="s2">the word and it&#39;s a great word because</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.690" end="00:26:39.720" style="s2">it&#39;s got that sense of like I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.909" end="00:26:41.730" style="s2">something to keep keep something not</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.720" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">going somewhere but just running the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.730" end="00:26:45.210" style="s2">engine keeping it going around and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">around and around it around it around it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.210" end="00:26:53.820" style="s2">around and and I know you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:56.070" style="s2">um from his view I don&#39;t talk I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.820" end="00:27:00.149" style="s2">you know in authenticity what didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.070" end="00:27:02.070" style="s2">have a moral edge to it it was it was it</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.149" end="00:27:05.399" style="s2">was a way of talking about how culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.070" end="00:27:07.529" style="s2">maintains itself right so like your</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.399" end="00:27:10.230" style="s2">aspiration is the interpretation to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.529" end="00:27:11.730" style="s2">culture how do they keep going and I and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.230" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">I thought thought about it is more like</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.730" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">um a foliage on the you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:19.380" style="s2">ground like a foliage and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:22.049" style="s2">authenticity is something like you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.380" end="00:27:23.970" style="s2">like this bursts of intelligibility that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.049" end="00:27:26.220" style="s2">comes up like a plant right that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.970" end="00:27:28.710" style="s2">blossoms out and then comes back down</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.220" end="00:27:31.590" style="s2">and alters the culture that becomes idle</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.710" end="00:27:34.230" style="s2">talk right yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.590" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">kind of thinking about that and can I</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.230" end="00:27:37.850" style="s2">say one thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:41.929" style="s2">Oakley&#39;s at that you you said which</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.850" end="00:27:45.270" style="s2">struck a chord with me it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.929" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">that when you use the term in</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.270" end="00:27:53.429" style="s2">authenticity it has such a moral cast to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:59.220" style="s2">it like what that&#39;s bad right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.429" end="00:28:02.390" style="s2">good to be authentic yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.220" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">interesting today if you take that moral</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.390" end="00:28:08.429" style="s2">part of it right and just look at what</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:10.679" style="s2">it is it&#39;s and I&#39;ve actually as I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.620" end="00:28:51.020" style="s2">feeling the wisdom of that Union be</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:53.640" style="s2">something that substantiating me like</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.020" end="00:28:55.409" style="s2">altered me changed me in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.640" end="00:28:58.169" style="s2">hard to talk about like too hard to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.409" end="00:29:03.059" style="s2">really articulate and I know for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.169" end="00:29:06.360" style="s2">that&#39;s an example of oh there is so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.059" end="00:29:10.230" style="s2">wisdom in these cultural structures that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.360" end="00:29:12.600" style="s2">have gone on for a long time right in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.230" end="00:29:17.820" style="s2">this kind of connection between wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.600" end="00:29:22.200" style="s2">and age wisdom and and in time and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.820" end="00:29:23.730" style="s2">duration significance so and since is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.200" end="00:29:25.890" style="s2">that that has really impacted me</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.730" end="00:29:28.919" style="s2">personally because I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.890" end="00:29:30.390" style="s2">more like when people are go to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.919" end="00:29:32.279" style="s2">coffee shop and they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.390" end="00:29:35.940" style="s2">this that may have shake their hands and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.279" end="00:29:38.580" style="s2">all of these I can start to see like</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.940" end="00:29:40.409" style="s2">know if it&#39;s in existence and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.580" end="00:29:43.710" style="s2">repeatable it means that there&#39;s wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.409" end="00:29:46.260" style="s2">in it right of generation after</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.710" end="00:29:47.899" style="s2">generation and I&#39;ve just come to start</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.260" end="00:29:52.679" style="s2">to appreciate that for me personally</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.899" end="00:29:57.390" style="s2">well can you imagine and sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.679" end="00:29:59.460" style="s2">think about everything it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.390" end="00:30:03.169" style="s2">and it might not work this way but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.460" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">seems to me that everything that is said</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.169" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">plus said</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.250" end="00:30:13.410" style="s2">initially like somebody said it nobody</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.490" end="00:30:34.040" style="s2">that but it was all invented and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.700" end="00:30:36.500" style="s2">a time before it wasn&#39;t yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.040" end="00:30:39.570" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.500" end="00:30:43.170" style="s2">totally and and what&#39;s interesting is</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.550" end="00:31:14.100" style="s2">distinguish and articulate all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.160" end="00:31:15.720" style="s2">changing all the change makers to change</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.100" end="00:31:19.020" style="s2">the understanding of being through</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.720" end="00:31:20.520" style="s2">history in II and he says that in and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.020" end="00:31:23.340" style="s2">was able to break it down into yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.520" end="00:31:25.260" style="s2">there&#39;s the person that first says it</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.340" end="00:31:28.200" style="s2">but then there&#39;s the people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.260" end="00:31:31.470" style="s2">translate what he says and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.200" end="00:31:35.580" style="s2">the people that actually then translate</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.470" end="00:31:37.800" style="s2">the translator as it integrates into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.580" end="00:31:40.340" style="s2">foliage right and by the time it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.800" end="00:31:43.380" style="s2">integrates into the foliage the written</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.340" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">remembers the person who originally said</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.380" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">it other than great and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.500" end="00:31:53.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.240" end="00:31:54.760" style="s2">and to think about your role if we say</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.380" end="00:31:59.770" style="s2">that like the human potential movement</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.760" end="00:32:03.549" style="s2">whatever it was that me made it make</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.770" end="00:32:05.980" style="s2">sense for a yogi to come to New York</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.549" end="00:32:07.900" style="s2">right and then hug you and you have that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.980" end="00:32:11.530" style="s2">experience and you&#39;ll be drawn to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.900" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">right and then write a book and you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.530" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">right in that time where the fringe was</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:20.970" style="s2">becoming a lot closer together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:25.630" style="s2">interesting to think about your role in</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.970" end="00:32:34.750" style="s2">that in that wave happening yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.630" end="00:32:37.000" style="s2">yeah yeah yes she does it was just I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.750" end="00:32:46.770" style="s2">just thinking back when he said that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.000" end="00:32:46.770" style="s2">about Swami Satchidananda we</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.670" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">we presented him at Carnegie Hall we did</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.020" end="00:33:04.980" style="s2">this presentation and we made these</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:10.740" style="s2">flyers they had a picture of him and he</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.980" end="00:33:15.150" style="s2">was very he looked like a Swami he</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.740" end="00:33:19.620" style="s2">looked like a yogi ridiculously well</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.150" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">again then refined and handsome and like</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.620" end="00:33:27.240" style="s2">a lion like with this graying hair and</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.240" end="00:33:34.830" style="s2">smile and made these flyers and I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.490" end="00:33:41.130" style="s2">the copy for the floor iris and the copy</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.830" end="00:33:44.390" style="s2">said Yoga is 5000 years old but it may</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.200" end="00:43:37.330" style="s2">when I think about that time I think</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.260" end="00:44:21.040" style="s2">oppressive to Jews with Jews Jewish men</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.560" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">Jewish boys were conscripted you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.040" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">the Cossacks would come to your village</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:34.570" style="s2">and press Jewish boys into service and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:37.570" style="s2">the Russian army for 15 years yeah that</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.630" end="00:44:58.300" style="s2">establishing themselves mostly in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.060" end="00:45:00.970" style="s2">eastern part of the US yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.300" end="00:45:04.150" style="s2">that they could be established in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.970" end="00:45:08.860" style="s2">place where the army wasn&#39;t gonna can</p>

<p begin="00:48:27.710" end="00:48:33.350" style="s2">really it seems like oh that was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.420" end="00:48:36.050" style="s2">million years ago but no yeah it was an</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.350" end="00:48:39.140" style="s2">television I was the first we were the</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.390" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">and all the kids on the block would come</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.970" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">to my house to watch things like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">Howdy Doody show though yeah yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:59.180" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:49:01.340" style="s2">so things that were hidden before you</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.180" end="00:49:04.070" style="s2">could easily hide yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.340" end="00:49:08.120" style="s2">like nobody cared that FDR had a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.070" end="00:49:11.600" style="s2">mistress nobody knew that FDR had a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.120" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2"> mistress and everybody began to</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:18.280" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.430" end="00:49:26.420" style="s2">can you hold on a minute</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.600" end="00:49:29.330" style="s2">you bet you got okay one second back so</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.420" end="00:49:33.020" style="s2">so you know the thing I think I&#39;m as</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.330" end="00:49:37.640" style="s2">you&#39;re talking I&#39;m and I&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.020" end="00:49:41.690" style="s2">versed on history but the it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.640" end="00:49:44.360" style="s2">this is where in the 50s was where the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.690" end="00:49:48.470" style="s2">the notion of really trusting and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.360" end="00:49:52.430" style="s2">institution right in that wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.470" end="00:49:53.960" style="s2">church seemed to like wear a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.430" end="00:49:56.020" style="s2">seemed like we&#39;re like a lot of coming</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.960" end="00:50:01.940" style="s2">out of the Middle Ages was very much</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.020" end="00:50:04.280" style="s2">Catholic Church right and that that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.940" end="00:50:06.230" style="s2">you know the the classic medieval town</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.280" end="00:50:08.750" style="s2">being being you know the church is at</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.230" end="00:50:10.730" style="s2">the center and everything and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.750" end="00:50:14.650" style="s2">center of the hierarchy right or mandala</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.730" end="00:50:18.170" style="s2">and then everything out there mirrors</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.650" end="00:50:20.330" style="s2">and there&#39;s I think there&#39;s just really</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.170" end="00:50:22.340" style="s2">this sense in in the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.330" end="00:50:24.320" style="s2">Revolution right and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.340" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">breaking of upload the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.320" end="00:50:34.010" style="s2">and and took you know Luther and all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:35.620" style="s2">that it&#39;s almost like the the center if</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.010" end="00:50:38.300" style="s2">you will seem to start to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.620" end="00:50:42.470" style="s2">redistributed in like corporations</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.300" end="00:50:45.830" style="s2">coca-cola right these these symbols that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.470" end="00:50:47.210" style="s2">became almost almost religious symbols</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.830" end="00:50:48.920" style="s2">like when they look at night like in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.210" end="00:50:52.580" style="s2">50s when I sometimes when I look at like</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.920" end="00:50:53.510" style="s2">coca-cola signs it they have this air</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.580" end="00:50:55.700" style="s2">about them</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.510" end="00:50:59.210" style="s2">that like they it seems to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.700" end="00:51:01.160" style="s2">gather the world in this particular it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.210" end="00:51:03.470" style="s2">a really do it has this kind of I can</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.160" end="00:51:06.350" style="s2">see it like you&#39;re a Cubs fan and your</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.470" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">kid and there&#39;s a whole there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.350" end="00:51:12.920" style="s2">thing that&#39;s good and it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:14.990" style="s2">coca-cola is a good thing and you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.920" end="00:51:19.700" style="s2">kind of get this sense of of this slice</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.990" end="00:51:21.350" style="s2">of life that&#39;s very idealized well it</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.700" end="00:51:24.350" style="s2">was called still called the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.350" end="00:51:32.240" style="s2">military-industrial complex yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.350" end="00:51:38.150" style="s2">and yeah and I think well the whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.240" end="00:51:42.650" style="s2">of consumerism right it became possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.150" end="00:51:48.290" style="s2">for people to just consume consume</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.650" end="00:51:54.080" style="s2">consume and buy things that advertised</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.290" end="00:51:58.730" style="s2">and created a need for no real need but</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.080" end="00:52:03.290" style="s2">that the psychology behind advertising</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.730" end="00:52:07.490" style="s2">creates all these needs for stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.290" end="00:52:11.930" style="s2">don&#39;t really want and in the meantime in</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.490" end="00:52:16.040" style="s2">the meantime there&#39;s the dispersal of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.930" end="00:52:20.450" style="s2">communities because you can drive your</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.040" end="00:52:22.580" style="s2">car now and live in the suburbs so you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.450" end="00:52:25.100" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be a farmer anymore to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.580" end="00:52:27.990" style="s2">live out and where there&#39;s trees and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.100" end="00:52:33.940" style="s2">stuff you just drive your car</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.990" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">and and families become nucleoli Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.940" end="00:52:39.900" style="s2">right there are no longer there no</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:43.779" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.900" end="00:52:48.789" style="s2">multi-generational there&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.779" end="00:52:54.819" style="s2">community around you yeah which people</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.789" end="00:52:58.720" style="s2">go oh that&#39;s a loss know what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.819" end="00:53:00.670" style="s2">him evolved you know now there was no</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.720" end="00:53:05.130" style="s2">choice about that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.670" end="00:53:08.819" style="s2">yes when people idealize all that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.130" end="00:53:11.140" style="s2">community and multi generations I</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.819" end="00:53:13.779" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have wanted to live in a house</p>

<p begin="00:53:13.779" end="00:53:21.789" style="s2">did it was suppressive yeah yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.549" end="00:53:25.900" style="s2">mean now you know people create families</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.789" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">of choice right there&#39;s some choice</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.900" end="00:53:34.390" style="s2">there yeah yeah yeah in the the yeah so</p>

<p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:47.859" style="s2">loss and he said anything he said like</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.440" end="00:53:50.890" style="s2">no it&#39;s it&#39;s just evolved right I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.859" end="00:53:53.529" style="s2">what I&#39;m here is that I hear and I hear</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.890" end="00:53:55.930" style="s2">a sensibility in that perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.529" end="00:53:58.480" style="s2">you just took and highlighted there</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.930" end="00:54:01.809" style="s2">which is something like it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:04.089" style="s2">there is some bad actor right</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.809" end="00:54:07.059" style="s2">that was doing something to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.089" end="00:54:10.150" style="s2">right in fact if we kind of look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.059" end="00:54:11.650" style="s2">history from that standpoint I basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.150" end="00:54:12.940" style="s2">have heard you a couple of times in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.650" end="00:54:15.220" style="s2">last in a lot in our last conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.940" end="00:54:17.980" style="s2">to talk about that as well as like no</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.220" end="00:54:20.410" style="s2">we&#39;re not a victim here yeah of things</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.980" end="00:54:23.470" style="s2">we were were we were born into a</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.410" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">situation and a circumstance and things</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.470" end="00:54:27.700" style="s2">were the way that they were right but</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:31.829" style="s2">it&#39;s not like somebody was doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.700" end="00:54:34.180" style="s2">something yeah and I think in a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.829" end="00:54:37.809" style="s2">this is great that you said that because</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.180" end="00:54:39.880" style="s2">it has me see something about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.809" end="00:54:41.300" style="s2">proliferation of all these conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.880" end="00:54:49.660" style="s2">theories or</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.300" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">yeah over 19 people assume I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.660" end="00:54:56.330" style="s2">people go for an easy explanation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">the easy explanation is yeah there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.330" end="00:55:06.260" style="s2">these bad people the Illuminati</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:09.020" style="s2">perhaps or the one-percenters or you</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.260" end="00:55:13.460" style="s2">know like an easy explanation rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.020" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">than it&#39;s random right right</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.460" end="00:55:20.810" style="s2">and then we make meaning right and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.680" end="00:55:22.930" style="s2">choose who you know and with them we get</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.810" end="00:55:27.080" style="s2">to be four things so we get to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.930" end="00:55:31.940" style="s2">against things like virtue of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.080" end="00:55:34.910" style="s2">yeah it would be easy if it were Trump</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.940" end="00:55:38.590" style="s2">you see right now I could just get rid</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.910" end="00:55:43.820" style="s2">of him and then we could all go back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.590" end="00:55:49.990" style="s2">the happy days of Obama no it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.820" end="00:55:52.940" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so much there&#39;s so much more</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.660" end="00:57:36.580" style="s2">way in which I&#39;m realizing one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.180" end="00:57:38.830" style="s2">things I&#39;m excited about about having</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.580" end="00:57:44.380" style="s2">you on is I think there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.830" end="00:57:47.260" style="s2">wisdom of what is it to be a elder in</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.380" end="00:57:50.620" style="s2">the culture and specifically a woman</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.260" end="00:57:55.480" style="s2">elder in this culture that actually kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.620" end="00:57:58.780" style="s2">of takes up being one on sometimes right</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.480" end="00:58:01.320" style="s2">it takes up what is that what what is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.780" end="00:58:04.090" style="s2">that right now to be a woman your age</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.320" end="00:58:07.930" style="s2">having had the history watching what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.090" end="00:58:12.540" style="s2">happening now um because it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.930" end="00:58:15.640" style="s2">that one of the things that&#39;s changed is</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.540" end="00:58:17.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just it used to be it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.640" end="00:58:20.590" style="s2">that the older like the older generation</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.890" end="00:58:23.650" style="s2">in most cultures anyways right the older</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.590" end="00:58:27.340" style="s2">generations were the people who were had</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.650" end="00:58:29.170" style="s2">the wisdom you know and like the there</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.340" end="00:58:30.760" style="s2">was a shaman and there were the Chiefs</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.170" end="00:58:33.010" style="s2">and there are the people that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.760" end="00:58:34.630" style="s2">like had the wisdom because they had</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.010" end="00:58:36.310" style="s2">gone through so many things they knew</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.630" end="00:58:38.380" style="s2">the right things to be afraid of and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.310" end="00:58:39.940" style="s2">right things to pay attention to and how</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.380" end="00:58:44.410" style="s2">to deal with that and what not to take</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.940" end="00:58:47.110" style="s2">care about wisdom and that with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.410" end="00:58:50.560" style="s2">wisdom institutions right in the place</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.110" end="00:58:52.330" style="s2">that has is cultivates wisdom to hold</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.560" end="00:58:55.960" style="s2">wisdom traditionally has been with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.330" end="00:58:58.060" style="s2">elders on Sanibel right yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.960" end="00:59:02.020" style="s2">actually when I when you look at like</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.060" end="00:59:06.700" style="s2">what old people are to us now is there</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.020" end="00:59:11.530" style="s2">senior citizens right oh yeah yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.700" end="00:59:15.100" style="s2">they&#39;re weak and stupid and I mean my</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.530" end="00:59:19.030" style="s2">generation help make that yes oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.100" end="00:59:23.130" style="s2">because my generation was the one that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.030" end="00:59:23.130" style="s2">said don&#39;t trust anyone over 30</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.400" end="00:59:34.240" style="s2">anything yeah yes a right so it was like</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.780" end="00:59:37.900" style="s2">a gestalt suspicion of any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.240" end="00:59:40.810" style="s2">authority and the authority to some</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.900" end="00:59:42.869" style="s2">version was all of it right love it</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.810" end="00:59:46.990" style="s2">so they&#39;re like no there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.869" end="00:59:48.550" style="s2">emergent that&#39;s new like the new becomes</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.990" end="00:59:51.850" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s the most interesting or</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.550" end="00:59:55.600" style="s2">the or the most outside of the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.850" end="00:59:58.570" style="s2">is the thing that is not the glows you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.600" end="01:00:03.490" style="s2">think about what&#39;s that yeah so when</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.570" end="01:00:17.020" style="s2">people say oh well we have to you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.490" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">what we lost was like reverence for</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.020" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">wisdom tradition for the elders and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">yeah totally so from that perspective so</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:29.050" style="s2">part of actually part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:33.130" style="s2">excited about is just the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.050" end="01:00:35.530" style="s2">you&#39;re 76 right and there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.130" end="01:00:37.960" style="s2">listening to this that as they told me</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.530" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">last time I discovered this they have</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.960" end="01:00:44.140" style="s2">like for YouTube they have like ass of</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">your you know all these statistics of</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.140" end="01:00:47.170" style="s2">your views and all this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:49.000" style="s2">that you can click this button is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.170" end="01:00:51.340" style="s2">what I was like oh well and my</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.000" end="01:00:55.480" style="s2">viewership is between I think age 25 and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.340" end="01:01:01.869" style="s2">35 most of them and so just being aware</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.480" end="01:01:03.490" style="s2">of the viewers listening in about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.869" end="01:01:06.190" style="s2">part of actually I think I&#39;m realizing</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.490" end="01:01:09.730" style="s2">is the is what&#39;s guiding my inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.190" end="01:01:11.320" style="s2">right is like Oh wasn&#39;t like what do we</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.730" end="01:01:14.710" style="s2">have them now that like from your</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.320" end="01:01:15.830" style="s2">vantage point is just just seems like</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.710" end="01:01:20.270" style="s2">unwise</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.830" end="01:01:23.510" style="s2">right just having that horizons of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.270" end="01:01:25.490" style="s2">background making it I don&#39;t I I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.510" end="01:01:29.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot sure there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.490" end="01:01:31.850" style="s2">stuff I don&#39;t like yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.420" end="01:01:33.740" style="s2">probably if I thought about it I could</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.850" end="01:01:44.030" style="s2">come up with things that I think are</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.740" end="01:01:51.020" style="s2">unwise I think I think being present is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.030" end="01:01:59.330" style="s2">everything yeah I mean I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.020" end="01:02:03.020" style="s2">solid worldview about this is unwise and</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.330" end="01:02:04.520" style="s2">that&#39;s unwise I really don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.020" end="01:02:08.510" style="s2">have prescriptions</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.520" end="01:02:12.860" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s it in ever and I think I</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.510" end="01:02:16.910" style="s2">think that&#39;s quite wise right there you</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.860" end="01:02:19.730" style="s2">you exude your exemplifying a particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.910" end="01:02:22.550" style="s2">wisdom in you in the intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.730" end="01:02:24.110" style="s2">right of some of your responses and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.550" end="01:02:28.090" style="s2">ways that you say things that I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.110" end="01:02:31.730" style="s2">noticing I&#39;m I&#39;m I want to celebrate oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.090" end="01:02:39.920" style="s2">well I I just thought of one thing to so</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.730" end="01:02:45.040" style="s2">good and that is what will continue what</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.920" end="01:02:45.040" style="s2">continues to be revealed to me as my own</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:53.720" style="s2">stupidity and then I can deal with</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.590" end="01:02:55.910" style="s2">something about it so let me give you an</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.720" end="01:03:01.310" style="s2">example because I can&#39;t quite articulate</p>

<p begin="01:17:43.290" end="01:17:47.910" style="s2">freedom that happens tremendous freedom</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.570" end="01:17:51.570" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.910" end="01:17:54.210" style="s2">just a tremendous freedom</p>

<p begin="01:18:10.800" end="01:18:13.320" style="s2">literally it&#39;s it&#39;s just really</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.240" end="01:18:15.950" style="s2">interesting that they have this</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.320" end="01:18:20.280" style="s2">conversation with you again right and</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.950" end="01:18:23.280" style="s2">because I what I really got is like</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.280" end="01:18:25.650" style="s2">there&#39;s the agent part right the agency</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.280" end="01:18:28.440" style="s2">part right the sovereignty part right</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.650" end="01:18:32.610" style="s2">we&#39;re in this difference between</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.440" end="01:18:34.260" style="s2">something like an identity versus</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.610" end="01:18:36.540" style="s2">something like this is what it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.260" end="01:18:39.930" style="s2">to me now is like something like agency</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.540" end="01:18:44.370" style="s2">or sovereignty right yeah it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.930" end="01:18:48.180" style="s2">idea like a space than an identity yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.370" end="01:18:50.160" style="s2">yeah and it is the way that I think for</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.180" end="01:18:52.530" style="s2">baekje talks about sovereignty is like</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.160" end="01:18:55.860" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the agent arena</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.530" end="01:18:57.900" style="s2">relationship right where there&#39;s no Sun</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.860" end="01:19:01.560" style="s2">like sovereignty so it only makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.900" end="01:19:05.280" style="s2">in an environment in a world right so</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.560" end="01:19:07.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like I am the am and the I right</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.280" end="01:19:10.920" style="s2">are they coexist mutually inform each</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.890" end="01:19:14.040" style="s2">other and I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.920" end="01:19:19.050" style="s2">about the more the more sovereign you</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.040" end="01:19:23.100" style="s2">are right the more agentic you are it it</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.050" end="01:19:25.680" style="s2">has to do with your ability to it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.100" end="01:19:29.100" style="s2">the sweet spot or your ability to lean</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.680" end="01:19:32.160" style="s2">into novelty in such a way that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.100" end="01:19:36.240" style="s2">novelty or the intelligibility of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.160" end="01:19:38.100" style="s2">arena of your world actually comes back</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.240" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">to you in such a way that has you learn</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.100" end="01:19:43.530" style="s2">more it has you understand more as you</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:45.780" style="s2">orient it more and as you are oriented</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.530" end="01:19:48.480" style="s2">more you open up to that novelty and</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.780" end="01:19:51.870" style="s2">more of its intelligibility comes into</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.480" end="01:19:55.410" style="s2">it and so there&#39;s like there&#39;s this it&#39;s</p>
