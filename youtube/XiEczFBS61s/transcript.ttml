<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:02.340" style="s2">And I met lots of people who were</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.699" end="00:00:07.499" style="s2">suicidal because of that but also unwilling to take care of themselves, you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.500" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">because they were so guilty about who they were ... and their mode of being in the world that they just felt that</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:18.220" style="s2">they weren&#39;t worth the damn trouble, you know, and,</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:24.680" style="s2">well, and they all had their own particular reasons for believing that their own</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:27.480" style="s2">failures, their own</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.490" end="00:00:31.529" style="s2">improper sacrifices, let&#39;s say, their own acts of individual malevolence;</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.540" end="00:00:38.999" style="s2">but they&#39;re summed up in a lovely metaphorical manner, <br />a horrifying metaphorical manner, in those ancient stories and</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.399" end="00:00:41.639" style="s2">those stories explain to us, too -</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.710" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">why as well that our consciences</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.050" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">don&#39;t sit well with us, and why we always feel that there&#39;s something undone that we should be doing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">which is a much better pathway to take, by the way, than to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.340" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">degenerate into nihilism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.100" end="00:00:58.780" style="s2">catastrophe and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.780" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">and that&#39;s really cool too - it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.690" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">well, you should treat yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.269" end="00:01:11.429" style="s2">like you&#39;re someone responsible for helping and the first question is &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you?&quot; and the answer is -</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.130" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">well, there&#39;s a lot wrong with you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.710" end="00:01:16.390" style="s2">you know and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.390" end="00:01:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.920" end="00:01:19.540" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.540" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">exercise</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:21.610" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.610" end="00:01:23.110" style="s2">love and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.110" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">care in a deep and non-naive way to care properly for</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.409" end="00:01:30.909" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.909" end="00:01:36.209" style="s2">but, you know, you do it for people that you love, despite their inadequacies, and - there is this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.490" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2">there is a spark of divinity within us and it is possible that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.869" end="00:01:45.569" style="s2">the fact that you have that spark of divinity (with you) within you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.149" end="00:01:48.149" style="s2">also means that you have the capability</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.670" end="00:01:49.960" style="s2">to withstand</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.960" end="00:01:52.019" style="s2">that terrible vulnerability;</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.180" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was trying to get at in Chapter 1 - which was to stand up straight with your shoulders back that you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.560" end="00:02:04.379" style="s2">voluntarily accept the onslaught of the tragedy of being and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.079" end="00:02:12.898" style="s2">constrain the proclivity for malevolence that&#39;s part of you and that&#39;s part of the world, and in that - you can discover your own value,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:20.069" style="s2">your own intrinsic value in your own nobility and all of that might be more powerful than the forces of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.069" end="00:02:23.579" style="s2">vulnerability and malevolence themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.590" end="00:02:30.479" style="s2">which I also happen to believe and I think that that is in some sense the fundamental hallmark of faith</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">and so, Chapter 2</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">and, to some degree, Chapter 3 wishes to surround yourself with people who want the best for you is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.560" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">it&#39;s an encouragement to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.349" end="00:02:49.738" style="s2">assume, to act out the proposition that even if life is as</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.470" end="00:02:52.060" style="s2">difficult as</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.060" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">it seems to be and if you&#39;re as vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.660" end="00:02:59.459" style="s2">weak in a fundamental sense as you definitely are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:03.330" style="s2">characterized by this terrible propensity for</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.180" end="00:03:05.410" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.410" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">infliction of voluntary suffering on yourself and others and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.030" end="00:03:13.979" style="s2">destructive tendency that there&#39;s still something within you that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.830" end="00:03:16.830" style="s2">remarkable and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:19.390" style="s2">aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.390" end="00:03:20.410" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.410" end="00:03:27.299" style="s2">order and being in the proper manner that you can climb above that, let&#39;s say like Abel, and that you can make the proper</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.790" end="00:03:31.829" style="s2">sacrifices and that you can set yourself right and you can set your family right</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.019" end="00:03:35.819" style="s2">and you can set the world right and that the mere possibility</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.160" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">that that might occur, that that might be within the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.500" end="00:03:46.259" style="s2">potential - means that you have a moral obligation to exercise the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.750" end="00:03:52.979" style="s2">responsibility to take care of yourself as if you&#39;re something that matters and that if you did that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.010" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">properly - it might turn out that:</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.440" end="00:04:03.749" style="s2">what you did would matter, that it would matter to you, that it would be meaningful in the way that things that matter are</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:07.259" style="s2">meaningful and that it would matter to everyone around you</p>
