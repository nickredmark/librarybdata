<p begin="00:00:08.189" end="00:00:13.139" style="s2">became the most high-profile victims of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.980" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">campus activism when they were chased</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.139" end="00:00:19.800" style="s2">out of evergreen college by a student</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">now it thrust them to national</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">prominence since then they&#39;re finding a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">new role as part of what&#39;s being called</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">your post but what&#39;s really striking is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:43.520" style="s2">that you and Heather were teaching</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">evolutionary biology so a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">between men and women a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:52.410" style="s2">subjects that are now really hot topics</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">in the culture within what a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">people would recognize as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:00:59.780" style="s2">most progressive left-wing colleges in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">the country are there lessons from that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.780" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">that and also when when you were forced</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">to leave Evergreen it wasn&#39;t the</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">those in over a decade of being there</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">what lessons how did he do it what</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:21.799" style="s2">lessons can we as a culture learn from</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">that there are tremendous lessons and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.799" end="00:01:30.920" style="s2">the key to what Heather and I were doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:33.329" style="s2">was that we started out by engineering a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.920" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">community that was safe to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">discussions and discussions that were we</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">to take what was said in our classroom</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">and to import it into a faculty meeting</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">would have caused a conflagration for</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">sure but you have a group of students</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">they show up many of them don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:50.790" style="s2">really know why they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">Heather and I were doing this for 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.790" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">years and a lot of our students came to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:57.869" style="s2">us word-of-mouth somebody said oh you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:01:59.369" style="s2">have to take this course and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.869" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">people who didn&#39;t realize they had any</p>

<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:11.430" style="s2">show up and then you lure them in it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.680" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">question of broadening their worldview</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.430" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">so that they can understand that all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">the things that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">no they care about all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:20.970" style="s2">that they find fun to do all of the</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:26.850" style="s2">things are products of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:30.930" style="s2">that means that understanding evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.850" end="00:02:34.350" style="s2">provides a kind of roadmap against the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.930" end="00:02:36.960" style="s2">inner confusion that&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.350" end="00:02:39.810" style="s2">incentive for people to embrace it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.960" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">the answer to your question is you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.810" end="00:02:45.270" style="s2">provide the safety to explore where</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:46.890" style="s2">people quickly get the idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.270" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">are not going to be backed against the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.890" end="00:02:50.730" style="s2">wall for saying something that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:55.320" style="s2">radical or off</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.730" end="00:02:57.470" style="s2">we had covenants that actually gave</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.320" end="00:02:59.640" style="s2">people the right to speak and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.470" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">retract what they said if it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.640" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">sound right or if they changed their</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:04.980" style="s2">mind or if they came to to see something</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">about their position they hadn&#39;t known</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.980" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">before which meant that they had the</p>

<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:14.220" style="s2">virtue of playing in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">so the cultivation of what if the term</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.220" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so polluted you&#39;d have to call a</p>

<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:23.520" style="s2">in creating these difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:25.890" style="s2">conversations and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.520" end="00:03:27.570" style="s2">incentive to have the conversation which</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.890" end="00:03:29.850" style="s2">comes from the fact that you get</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.570" end="00:03:33.030" style="s2">something positive for it you know to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.850" end="00:03:35.310" style="s2">understand yourself to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.030" end="00:03:38.490" style="s2">people interact in the way they do is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.310" end="00:03:41.640" style="s2">very powerful advantage and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.490" end="00:03:44.730" style="s2">presented with the question of would you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.640" end="00:03:46.470" style="s2">like to endure some discomfort in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.730" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">to have the power to understand your own</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.470" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">life almost everybody will say yes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.280" end="00:03:54.360" style="s2">of people are describing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">intellectual darkweb as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.360" end="00:03:59.310" style="s2">placeholder for this is what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:00.690" style="s2">conversation looks like that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.310" end="00:04:03.180" style="s2">lot of different perspectives within it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.690" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">but what people agree on is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.180" end="00:04:08.520" style="s2">a genuine conversation in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:10.380" style="s2">looks like and we&#39;ve made that a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.520" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">a focus on our Channel what we&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.380" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">the meta conversation what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:17.850" style="s2">exist for this meta conversation to take</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:20.850" style="s2">place and what are the forces are acting</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.850" end="00:04:24.889" style="s2">against it the meta conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.850" end="00:04:28.039" style="s2">requires a kind of safety</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.889" end="00:04:30.229" style="s2">and the thing that the IDW has done is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.039" end="00:04:32.870" style="s2">it has bootstrapped that kind of safety</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.229" end="00:04:35.960" style="s2">on topics where people experience in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.870" end="00:04:38.210" style="s2">general a profound lack of safety so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.960" end="00:04:42.919" style="s2">think the reason that there has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.210" end="00:04:45.460" style="s2">such a focus on the IDW is that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.919" end="00:04:49.430" style="s2">through the internet can watch others</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.460" end="00:04:51.439" style="s2">saying things the very nuance of which</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.430" end="00:04:54.889" style="s2">would cause them to blow up if you said</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.439" end="00:04:57.500" style="s2">them you know in a speech on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.889" end="00:04:59.150" style="s2">university campus let&#39;s say and watching</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.500" end="00:05:00.860" style="s2">people have those discussions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.150" end="00:05:04.550" style="s2">respond to each other in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.860" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">disagreement and not have catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.550" end="00:05:11.389" style="s2">rein in on them is I think heartening in</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:13.159" style="s2">fact I know that that&#39;s the reaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.389" end="00:05:16.029" style="s2">because I hear a lot from individuals</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.159" end="00:05:19.580" style="s2">who tell me what they see and they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.029" end="00:05:22.099" style="s2">cheering for the the simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.580" end="00:05:24.379" style="s2">demonstration that these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.099" end="00:05:27.439" style="s2">are still possible on our channel we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.379" end="00:05:29.990" style="s2">talked a lot about what we call the meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.439" end="00:05:33.020" style="s2">conversation and the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.990" end="00:05:35.650" style="s2">darkweb seems to be an attempt to sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.020" end="00:05:37.490" style="s2">of carve out a space to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.650" end="00:05:40.099" style="s2">conversations about things that are very</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.490" end="00:05:44.839" style="s2">difficult to have to talk about in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.099" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">media and I&#39;m really interested as as</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.839" end="00:05:48.589" style="s2">well your background in evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:50.509" style="s2">obviously a lot of people know about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.589" end="00:05:53.419" style="s2">what happened and you and Brett being</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.509" end="00:05:55.819" style="s2">forced to leave but what really struck</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.419" end="00:05:58.339" style="s2">me is that you both were teaching</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.819" end="00:06:01.490" style="s2">evolutionary biology there for over a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.339" end="00:06:03.800" style="s2">decade without creating any of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.490" end="00:06:05.240" style="s2">reactions that we&#39;re seeing talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.800" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">about the reality of sex differences</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.240" end="00:06:09.229" style="s2">talking about these subjects that often</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">provoked a huge reaction when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.229" end="00:06:14.900" style="s2">discussed in the media so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">interested what that was like how you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.900" end="00:06:19.430" style="s2">did it and whether there are any lessons</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.210" end="00:06:20.389" style="s2">that we can learn more generally about</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.430" end="00:06:23.439" style="s2">how to have these kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.389" end="00:06:27.500" style="s2">a technique that both Brett and I used</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.439" end="00:06:30.139" style="s2">was to open the first day by saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.500" end="00:06:32.629" style="s2">don&#39;t trust me don&#39;t trust me on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.139" end="00:06:34.789" style="s2">basis of my credentials and my authority</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.629" end="00:06:36.980" style="s2">or the fact that certainly that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.789" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">that I have the power to assess you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.980" end="00:06:41.390" style="s2">affect your future as a result I have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.880" style="s2">earn your trust have to earn your</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.390" end="00:06:47.030" style="s2">respect and hopefully over time I will</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.880" end="00:06:48.140" style="s2">and you can stop questioning every</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.030" end="00:06:51.950" style="s2">single thing that comes out of my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.140" end="00:06:53.450" style="s2">but to begin with please do please do</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.950" end="00:06:54.290" style="s2">question that that is actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.450" end="00:06:59.690" style="s2">be a sign of respect</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.290" end="00:07:01.730" style="s2">and we both Brett and I insisted on</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.690" end="00:07:06.170" style="s2">classrooms that were always respectful</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.730" end="00:07:09.140" style="s2">and that always understood that people</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.170" end="00:07:11.450" style="s2">disagreeing with ideas was quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.140" end="00:07:13.640" style="s2">different from proclaiming dislike of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.450" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">the human beings who were voicing those</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.640" end="00:07:18.890" style="s2">ideas and so you know separating out</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.710" end="00:07:21.410" style="s2">those two things the human the human the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.890" end="00:07:23.660" style="s2">whole human person and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.410" end="00:07:25.790" style="s2">they are saying at the moment even if</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.660" end="00:07:27.760" style="s2">it&#39;s some entrenched firmly held belief</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.790" end="00:07:30.920" style="s2">still those are two different things and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.760" end="00:07:34.010" style="s2">disagreement does not this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.920" end="00:07:35.330" style="s2">same as dislike for the person when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.010" end="00:07:37.820" style="s2">talked together this was particularly</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.330" end="00:07:39.260" style="s2">easy to demonstrate because as a married</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.820" end="00:07:40.610" style="s2">couple who were presumably not on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.260" end="00:07:43.640" style="s2">verge of divorce which we which we</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.610" end="00:07:45.140" style="s2">weren&#39;t we could disagree with each</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.640" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">other and we did and you know even</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.140" end="00:07:47.780" style="s2">though we were right in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:49.250" style="s2">our own material you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.780" end="00:07:52.010" style="s2">disagree on topics of sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.250" end="00:07:54.140" style="s2">and you know evolution of parental care</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.010" end="00:07:55.580" style="s2">and you know under what conditions</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.140" end="00:07:56.660" style="s2">territoriality involves and these sorts</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.580" end="00:07:58.820" style="s2">of things that we were we were always</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.660" end="00:08:01.580" style="s2">teaching on and students could observe</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.820" end="00:08:04.520" style="s2">how we disagreed what that looked like</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.580" end="00:08:06.530" style="s2">and also watch us come back in the next</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.520" end="00:08:08.230" style="s2">one and clearly having you know shared</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.530" end="00:08:11.030" style="s2">dinner and abend the night before so</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.230" end="00:08:12.790" style="s2">this sort of model of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.030" end="00:08:17.150" style="s2">disagreement disagreement was</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.790" end="00:08:20.300" style="s2">particularly easy frankly to do when it</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.150" end="00:08:24.920" style="s2">was us together in a classroom and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.300" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">think students very quickly did feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.920" end="00:08:31.790" style="s2">seen and I know that many of them did I</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:33.290" style="s2">hope that nearly all of them did feel to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.790" end="00:08:36.110" style="s2">some degree understood you know we</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.290" end="00:08:38.180" style="s2">insisted on knowing all of their names</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:39.560" style="s2">very quickly and you know by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.180" end="00:08:41.479" style="s2">the first week of class I would know</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.560" end="00:08:43.940" style="s2">everyone&#39;s names and at least something</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.479" end="00:08:47.660" style="s2">some thing about their developmental</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.940" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">history which would allow me to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.660" end="00:08:49.940" style="s2">sort of you know building an</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:51.530" style="s2">architecture in my head</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.940" end="00:08:53.480" style="s2">who is this person it&#39;s cool still gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.530" end="00:08:55.520" style="s2">be a cartoon for quite a while and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.480" end="00:08:56.690" style="s2">know to some degree we it&#39;s all I carry</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.520" end="00:08:58.310" style="s2">around with us you know we have these</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.690" end="00:09:00.220" style="s2">caricatures that maybe turn to cartoons</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.310" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">that maybe become more fleshed out and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.220" end="00:09:04.940" style="s2">maybe we get these photorealistic images</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:06.500" style="s2">in our heads of other human beings after</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.940" end="00:09:09.830" style="s2">we know them for decades but it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.500" end="00:09:12.230" style="s2">complete and so to just start going down</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.830" end="00:09:14.360" style="s2">that road to make it clear that you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.230" end="00:09:16.250" style="s2">going down that road with each one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.360" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">the people in the classroom and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.250" end="00:09:20.350" style="s2">because you think it&#39;s your job but</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:26.330" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually very interested</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.350" end="00:09:29.240" style="s2">meant that we didn&#39;t we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.330" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">talk about difficult subjects pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.240" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">easily right we and you know in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:36.200" style="s2">ways it was what students were signing</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:38.180" style="s2">up for you know I didn&#39;t the the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.200" end="00:09:40.910" style="s2">kinds of programs that I did most were</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.180" end="00:09:42.620" style="s2">vertebrate evolution which was not did</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.910" end="00:09:44.360" style="s2">not fear too much into politically</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.620" end="00:09:46.520" style="s2">dangerous territory but animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.360" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">is rife with it you know you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.520" end="00:09:51.980" style="s2">can&#39;t not go there if you want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:53.660" style="s2">honestly and so talking about and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.980" end="00:09:55.370" style="s2">know and humans are animals so we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.660" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">we didn&#39;t fear from humans and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:09:58.940" style="s2">all the seminars that I tend to do in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">those programs were specifically on</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.940" end="00:10:04.520" style="s2">humans on human evolution readings what</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:09.710" style="s2">our history has looked like and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.520" end="00:10:11.330" style="s2">our prehistory and frankly students</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.710" end="00:10:13.460" style="s2">especially from historically</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.330" end="00:10:16.130" style="s2">marginalized and oppressed groups were</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.460" end="00:10:18.080" style="s2">particularly interested several several</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.130" end="00:10:19.700" style="s2">people told me nearly every year I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.080" end="00:10:22.580" style="s2">taught this material but they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.700" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">particularly interested to finally get a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.580" end="00:10:29.660" style="s2">read on what it was that evolution had</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:31.970" style="s2">to say about about being gay or about</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.660" end="00:10:33.230" style="s2">different races or about especially in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.970" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">you know in my case I would teach a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.230" end="00:10:39.880" style="s2">on sex and gender and you know on on</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:45.590" style="s2">what it was to be male versus female and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.880" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">also to specifically be educated and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.590" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">to assess bad logic because that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:53.330" style="s2">was the thing you know that&#39;s anyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:55.070" style="s2">who&#39;s teaching in 2018 or the 21st</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.980" end="00:11:31.990" style="s2">means that what you&#39;ve just proposed me</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.630" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">is not a testable hypothesis this we</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.990" end="00:11:36.760" style="s2">can&#39;t do science on it and if you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:38.380" style="s2">to take some other way of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.760" end="00:11:39.910" style="s2">try to try to do it with what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.380" end="00:11:42.130" style="s2">said okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.910" end="00:11:44.470" style="s2">but if we are trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.130" end="00:11:46.690" style="s2">is true science is the best tool we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.470" end="00:11:48.730" style="s2">got and we can&#39;t do science on the thing</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.950" end="00:11:54.190" style="s2">then let&#39;s work as hard as we can to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">falsify it and then if we can&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.190" end="00:11:58.060" style="s2">longer we can&#39;t the more likely it is</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.060" end="00:12:05.080" style="s2">freeing it&#39;s so freeing it&#39;s an it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.700" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">called a covenant in an evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.780" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">classroom which established in advance</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">what the responsibilities are between</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:15.570" style="s2">all the players between</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:17.100" style="s2">students in both directions and what do</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.570" end="00:13:18.690" style="s2">you do if you have a conflict and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.100" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">know all of all of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.690" end="00:13:26.580" style="s2">should expect in an honorable community</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:28.920" style="s2">and in the case of a classroom as much</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.580" end="00:13:33.690" style="s2">as you know it was it was easy to handle</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.920" end="00:13:36.390" style="s2">the authority it on an everyday basis</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.690" end="00:13:38.940" style="s2">and say please question anything that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.390" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">say that you don&#39;t agree with but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.940" end="00:13:42.390" style="s2">fact is it wasn&#39;t a complete handing</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">authority because I was still faculty at</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.390" end="00:13:46.140" style="s2">the end of the day and so it was still</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:49.380" style="s2">clearly my you know I was still going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.140" end="00:13:52.230" style="s2">be the arbiter of of disputes that came</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.380" end="00:13:55.350" style="s2">up so you need that how do you scale</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.230" end="00:13:57.870" style="s2">that into a non classroom situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.350" end="00:13:59.970" style="s2">where there is no clear even an</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.870" end="00:14:02.130" style="s2">authority that wants to cede their</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.970" end="00:14:04.740" style="s2">authority you need someone who can step</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.130" end="00:14:06.660" style="s2">in and say mmm you&#39;re you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.740" end="00:14:10.050" style="s2">against the rules and you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.660" end="00:14:12.510" style="s2">Covenant before that is that really</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.050" end="00:14:14.430" style="s2">important to basically ask people to buy</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.510" end="00:14:16.710" style="s2">into a set of principles before engaging</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.430" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">in the conversation covenants were a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.710" end="00:14:22.440" style="s2">feature of Evergreen from its founding</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:24.840" style="s2">so the founders of the college decided</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.440" end="00:14:26.490" style="s2">that every class should begin with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.840" end="00:14:29.010" style="s2">covenant between professor and student</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.490" end="00:14:31.850" style="s2">in which the expectations were set out</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.010" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">most of the covenants that I saw were</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.850" end="00:14:37.530" style="s2">uninteresting but it was a place where</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:43.260" style="s2">if you chose to you could do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.530" end="00:14:45.420" style="s2">work and the key utility is that by</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.260" end="00:14:46.710" style="s2">setting the expectations out as you come</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.420" end="00:14:48.840" style="s2">through the door while you still have</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.710" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">the right to say huh maybe this program</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.840" end="00:14:54.690" style="s2">isn&#39;t for me that means that later on</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">when you invoke this covenant and say</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.690" end="00:15:02.370" style="s2">well you agreed to this set of rules why</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.130" end="00:15:04.230" style="s2">are you now saying something else people</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.370" end="00:15:05.700" style="s2">people recognize that that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.230" end="00:15:08.580" style="s2">obligations they&#39;ve signed up for are</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.700" end="00:15:10.260" style="s2">important and I will say one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.580" end="00:15:12.750" style="s2">things that I started adding to my</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.260" end="00:15:15.870" style="s2">covenants late in my teaching at</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.750" end="00:15:18.900" style="s2">Evergreen was that this is not an end</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.620" end="00:15:29.099" style="s2">Covenant was the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.059" end="00:15:32.189" style="s2">it was imperative that you read it so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.099" end="00:15:35.189" style="s2">that you understood why you were being</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.189" end="00:15:41.129" style="s2">by and large it worked quite well we</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.209" end="00:15:44.039" style="s2">spent time on these things on the first</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.129" end="00:15:46.799" style="s2">day of class of people so people got it</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.039" end="00:15:48.239" style="s2">and then having signed up for it in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.799" end="00:15:50.459" style="s2">experience and Heather&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.239" end="00:15:53.189" style="s2">people pretty well lived by it and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.459" end="00:15:56.429" style="s2">had communities of good faith</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.189" end="00:15:58.529" style="s2">interactants that functioned beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.429" end="00:16:02.189" style="s2">most of the time and how do we take</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.529" end="00:16:03.209" style="s2">those lessons out and apply those in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.189" end="00:16:05.849" style="s2">world more generally I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.209" end="00:16:08.789" style="s2">intellectual dark web is one attempt at</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.789" end="00:16:14.249" style="s2">a better word but are there are other</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.439" end="00:16:16.469" style="s2">ways that we can do it well the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.249" end="00:16:18.119" style="s2">is you will immediately not having such</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.469" end="00:16:19.469" style="s2">a covenant you will immediately trip</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.119" end="00:16:23.479" style="s2">over the following problem if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.469" end="00:16:26.009" style="s2">attempt it the Covenant is exclusionary</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.479" end="00:16:29.369" style="s2">what you are really saying when you set</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.009" end="00:16:31.649" style="s2">out an agreement about how we will talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.369" end="00:16:33.629" style="s2">and disagree and challenge each other is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.649" end="00:16:35.309" style="s2">you are saying that if you don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.629" end="00:16:37.829" style="s2">to these rules you&#39;re not welcome here</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.309" end="00:16:39.539" style="s2">now nobody likes to hear you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.829" end="00:16:41.069" style="s2">welcome here and at the moment that sets</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.539" end="00:16:43.169" style="s2">people off it&#39;s I have a hair-trigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.069" end="00:16:44.489" style="s2">for being told somebody&#39;s not welcome</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.169" end="00:16:46.469" style="s2">there who are you to say who&#39;s welcome</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.489" end="00:16:49.019" style="s2">and appoint as well no I&#39;m not telling</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.469" end="00:16:51.539" style="s2">you you&#39;re not welcome I&#39;m telling you</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.539" end="00:16:55.439" style="s2">good faith principles isn&#39;t welcome and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.429" end="00:16:57.089" style="s2">as soon as you do agree then you are so</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.439" end="00:17:00.359" style="s2">you&#39;re the one deciding whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.089" end="00:17:03.529" style="s2">welcome or not having decided to live by</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.359" end="00:17:08.279" style="s2">these rules then you get the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.529" end="00:17:11.730" style="s2">what is in effect a much more capable</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.279" end="00:17:16.490" style="s2">but more fragile conversation and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.730" end="00:17:18.869" style="s2">is I think one of the hardest lessons of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.490" end="00:17:21.119" style="s2">well the hardest lessons for me at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.869" end="00:17:25.649" style="s2">of complex systems is that very often</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.119" end="00:17:28.619" style="s2">the most capable creatures or mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.649" end="00:17:30.990" style="s2">are also the ones with the narrowest</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.619" end="00:17:32.999" style="s2">requirements so that a beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.990" end="00:17:34.679" style="s2">architected creature may have very</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.999" end="00:17:36.990" style="s2">precise limits on what it can tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.679" end="00:17:39.629" style="s2">the beautiful conversation that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.990" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">capable of traversing some new landscape</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.629" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">and doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:45.990" style="s2">deftly that conversation does not happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:48.450" style="s2">when anybody can law any accusation at</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.990" end="00:17:50.700" style="s2">any moment with no evidence it happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.450" end="00:17:52.950" style="s2">when people are protected enough to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.700" end="00:17:55.019" style="s2">out difficult things and then to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.950" end="00:18:00.750" style="s2">their position and learn where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.019" end="00:18:03.029" style="s2">arrived so the upshot you have to be</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.559" end="00:18:11.429" style="s2">you&#39;re excluding them for very simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.690" end="00:18:16.830" style="s2">reasons which is that their presence</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.429" end="00:18:19.110" style="s2">will destroy the attempt so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.830" end="00:18:22.649" style="s2">have to figure out how to intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.110" end="00:18:24.630" style="s2">exclude in the interest of accomplishing</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.649" end="00:18:26.130" style="s2">something for which there is obviously a</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.130" end="00:18:32.370" style="s2">implies that there is a deficit and if</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.610" end="00:18:34.919" style="s2">you were to distill down what say three</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.370" end="00:18:37.470" style="s2">or four principles of having a</p>

<p begin="00:18:37.470" end="00:18:44.250" style="s2">are what would they be what conditions</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.850" end="00:18:46.019" style="s2">allow for that so how do you know you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:15.029" style="s2">there&#39;s probably fear right underneath</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.880" end="00:19:17.789" style="s2">the surface similarly I would say look</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.029" end="00:19:20.490" style="s2">for laughter look for humor look look</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.789" end="00:19:21.870" style="s2">for and not just you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.490" end="00:19:27.149" style="s2">everyone can tell the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.870" end="00:19:29.789" style="s2">a nervous laughter and and regular from</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.149" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">the gut laughter in which things even</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.789" end="00:19:33.590" style="s2">when you didn&#39;t see something coming or</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:35.610" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s often when things get funny</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.590" end="00:19:37.139" style="s2">when a conversation that was very</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.610" end="00:19:38.940" style="s2">serious or very technical suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.139" end="00:19:41.070" style="s2">erupts and laughter if that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:44.639" style="s2">there&#39;s probably not fear right beneath</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.639" end="00:19:52.059" style="s2">is also a way that people people bond if</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.100" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">obviously if you see people changing</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.330" end="00:20:03.580" style="s2">their minds or people challenging one</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.100" end="00:20:12.070" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of just too obvious I guess</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.919" end="00:20:16.779" style="s2">I guess those first two that I came up</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.070" end="00:20:21.070" style="s2">with or maybe maybe two that I remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.779" end="00:20:22.750" style="s2">most fondly from the collapse from both</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.070" end="00:20:25.960" style="s2">you know these three-hour meandering</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.750" end="00:20:28.539" style="s2">interactive lectures or labs or even</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.960" end="00:20:30.789" style="s2">more often you know long meals on field</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.539" end="00:20:32.950" style="s2">trips where students cooked and then we</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.789" end="00:20:34.210" style="s2">all ate together and then we might sit</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.950" end="00:20:38.649" style="s2">around the table for hours afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.210" end="00:20:41.020" style="s2">ago and sit around a campfire and having</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.649" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">such conversations that ranged from</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.020" end="00:20:47.980" style="s2">deeply theoretical science to the state</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:50.230" style="s2">of the world to individual stories from</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.980" end="00:20:52.210" style="s2">people&#39;s childhoods about their siblings</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.230" end="00:20:55.299" style="s2">or their animals or the adventures</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.210" end="00:20:56.830" style="s2">they&#39;ve been on interspersed with I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.299" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">this is always helpful to someone breaks</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:05.380" style="s2">laughing together singing together is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.950" end="00:21:07.029" style="s2">way to bring people together so these</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.380" end="00:21:07.899" style="s2">are some of the things that can&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.029" end="00:21:10.029" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.899" end="00:21:11.980" style="s2">which is part of I think why we find</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.029" end="00:21:15.970" style="s2">such an impoverished and quick to anger</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.980" end="00:21:17.649" style="s2">set of conversations online that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.970" end="00:21:19.779" style="s2">missing they&#39;re just like the actual</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.649" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">visceral being in each other&#39;s presence</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.779" end="00:21:28.630" style="s2">and that very quickly allows us to let</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:30.210" style="s2">our guard down you you mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.630" end="00:21:32.710" style="s2">sort of sense of fear under the surface</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.210" end="00:21:35.140" style="s2">which I think a lot of people would say</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.710" end="00:21:37.630" style="s2">it&#39;s very present at the moment in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.140" end="00:21:41.370" style="s2">of conversations did you feel that fear</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.630" end="00:21:46.350" style="s2">in Evergreen until things erupted it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.370" end="00:21:46.350" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting question yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.340" end="00:21:52.450" style="s2">because Brett and I are married and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.770" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">we&#39;re faculty there together and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.450" end="00:21:58.270" style="s2">watching the whole thing unfold we</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:22:03.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel fear we like we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.270" end="00:22:03.820" style="s2">afraid but there was a definite culture</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:07.660" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.820" end="00:22:12.010" style="s2">fear in which people were not speaking</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.660" end="00:22:13.330" style="s2">what they knew to be true and Brett</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.010" end="00:22:15.600" style="s2">heard this much more than I did because</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.330" end="00:22:16.990" style="s2">he was more public with his</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:21.370" style="s2">disagreements with what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.990" end="00:22:23.020" style="s2">administration was doing but after every</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.370" end="00:22:24.730" style="s2">time that he would stand up in a faculty</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.020" end="00:22:27.250" style="s2">meeting or send an email to the faculty</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.730" end="00:22:30.730" style="s2">and staff email list he would have</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.250" end="00:22:32.350" style="s2">several sometimes very many faculty and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.730" end="00:22:34.090" style="s2">staff come to him privately on private</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:37.770" style="s2">channels either in person or over email</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.090" end="00:22:41.640" style="s2">and say thank you I can&#39;t say it because</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.770" end="00:22:45.850" style="s2">that&#39;s a culture of fear and in fact he</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.640" end="00:22:48.520" style="s2">claimed this he said this six months or</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.850" end="00:22:51.780" style="s2">so before the Evergreen protests became</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.520" end="00:22:54.970" style="s2">public and went viral and the response</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.780" end="00:22:56.980" style="s2">he said this I think over email and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.970" end="00:22:58.360" style="s2">response from some of the faculty who</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.980" end="00:23:01.150" style="s2">were leading the charge who are leading</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.360" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">the authoritarian leftist charge was</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.150" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">there&#39;s no culture of fear prove it who</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:09.550" style="s2">has come to you well I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:11.800" style="s2">tell you who has come to me because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.550" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly how this this would work</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.800" end="00:23:18.790" style="s2">and you know people will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:22.210" style="s2">come to me only you know only if I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.790" end="00:23:24.460" style="s2">protect them and you know I think one</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.210" end="00:23:28.750" style="s2">thing that I won&#39;t speak for Brett here</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.460" end="00:23:33.160" style="s2">but one thing that I think I wish that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.750" end="00:23:36.610" style="s2">had done differently was ask people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.160" end="00:23:40.570" style="s2">were coming to us privately to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.610" end="00:23:42.150" style="s2">I did on a couple of occasions and there</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.570" end="00:23:45.220" style="s2">are a lot of reasons not to and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.150" end="00:23:47.880" style="s2">understand them but this could have had</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.220" end="00:23:50.260" style="s2">a totally different ending and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.880" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">furthermore it could have modeled for</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.260" end="00:23:54.760" style="s2">everyplace else that this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:58.420" style="s2">which is to say just about every</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.760" end="00:24:00.580" style="s2">American campus a lot of workplaces and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.420" end="00:24:02.710" style="s2">boy have we heard stories you know we</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.580" end="00:24:04.390" style="s2">the the college campus ones are easy to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.710" end="00:24:06.970" style="s2">report on because they tend to be in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.390" end="00:24:08.890" style="s2">these public places with you know poor</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.970" end="00:24:10.570" style="s2">young indoctrinated students apparently</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.890" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">making asses of themselves but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.570" end="00:24:14.610" style="s2">that&#39;s not the real story you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:18.390" style="s2">I really don&#39;t think that there they are</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.610" end="00:24:19.950" style="s2">the ones who are driving this and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.390" end="00:24:22.230" style="s2">we have you think it&#39;s the professor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.950" end="00:24:24.780" style="s2">driving it yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.230" end="00:24:28.010" style="s2">professor&#39;s it&#39;s the professor&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.780" end="00:24:30.120" style="s2">increasingly the administrators and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.010" end="00:24:33.900" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say that students don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.120" end="00:24:36.600" style="s2">have agency but very little of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.900" end="00:24:38.940" style="s2">modern protests looks like protests the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.600" end="00:24:42.600" style="s2">likes of which I remember I participated</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.940" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">in it feels very much more about</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.600" end="00:24:47.010" style="s2">orthodoxy and about falling into line</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:49.410" style="s2">and about reading from a script&#39; and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.010" end="00:24:50.460" style="s2">fact that I have now seen not just at</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.410" end="00:24:52.650" style="s2">Evergreen but at two different</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.460" end="00:24:53.720" style="s2">conferences and a couple of other places</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.650" end="00:24:56.460" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.720" end="00:24:58.169" style="s2">these attempted power grabs in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.460" end="00:25:02.850" style="s2">places successful like at Evergreen in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.169" end="00:25:05.429" style="s2">some places not in which the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.850" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">authoritarian power grabbers start using</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.429" end="00:25:11.669" style="s2">all the same words it&#39;s it&#39;s all on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:13.559" style="s2">same script so it&#39;s it&#39;s not that there</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.669" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">is some central clearinghouse where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.559" end="00:25:19.230" style="s2">coming out of but but it comes from some</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:21.780" style="s2">traditions within unfortunately within</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.230" end="00:25:23.580" style="s2">the humanities increasingly being taught</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.780" end="00:25:25.620" style="s2">at schools of Education and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.580" end="00:25:27.690" style="s2">spreading very quickly into the k-12</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.620" end="00:25:30.770" style="s2">system primary and secondary school and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.690" end="00:25:33.960" style="s2">thus frankly indoctrinate and whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.770" end="00:25:35.970" style="s2">hosts of children who are now coming of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.960" end="00:25:38.010" style="s2">age and don&#39;t have the tools with which</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.970" end="00:25:40.380" style="s2">to question what it is they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.010" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">told so I would say increasingly it will</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.380" end="00:25:46.200" style="s2">become a problem that the young people</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:49.290" style="s2">themselves are perpetrating on the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.200" end="00:25:51.480" style="s2">but at least until very recently it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.290" end="00:25:53.220" style="s2">being driven by the faculty it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.480" end="00:25:55.410" style="s2">driven being driven by the people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.220" end="00:25:57.960" style="s2">were supposedly the adults who were</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.410" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">supposed to know better and who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.960" end="00:26:04.890" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I would say I wish that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:08.340" style="s2">had had the foresight to ask anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.890" end="00:26:10.110" style="s2">came to Brett Army privately and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.340" end="00:26:13.320" style="s2">know maybe not to push it but to ask</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.110" end="00:26:14.820" style="s2">will you please say this publicly and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.320" end="00:26:16.950" style="s2">for the most part I didn&#39;t for the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.820" end="00:26:19.559" style="s2">part I said thank you it&#39;s good to know</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.950" end="00:26:21.390" style="s2">we&#39;re out alone and that&#39;s true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.559" end="00:26:23.940" style="s2">it&#39;s very good to know you&#39;re not alone</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.390" end="00:26:26.160" style="s2">when you&#39;re facing some you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.940" end="00:26:27.010" style="s2">stupid and horrifying stuff but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.160" end="00:26:29.710" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.010" end="00:26:31.780" style="s2">ultimately what you need is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.710" end="00:26:34.030" style="s2">that higher percentage of people to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.780" end="00:26:35.410" style="s2">stand up and say I see this and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.030" end="00:26:36.549" style="s2">emperor has no clothes you know like</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.410" end="00:26:39.790" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s what it is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.549" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">waiting for that moment and one or two</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.790" end="00:26:45.220" style="s2">or three people isn&#39;t enough yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:47.950" style="s2">group that that&#39;s that is that big when</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.220" end="00:26:53.580" style="s2">the when the authoritarians on the left</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.950" end="00:26:56.470" style="s2">are shrieking in language that sounds</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.919" end="00:27:27.309" style="s2">something about what the rules are</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.510" end="00:27:29.140" style="s2">having played around with different</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.150" end="00:27:35.410" style="s2">interesting thing about the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.440" end="00:27:37.960" style="s2">phenomenon is that we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.410" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">written set of rules what happened is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.960" end="00:27:45.610" style="s2">people who separately had arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:49.480" style="s2">some sort of kit for doing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.610" end="00:27:51.460" style="s2">work found each other because the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.480" end="00:27:54.010" style="s2">had become a place in which conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.460" end="00:27:57.220" style="s2">had become impossible so if conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.010" end="00:27:59.710" style="s2">is impossible because saying things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.220" end="00:28:02.260" style="s2">should be say about causes a blowout and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.710" end="00:28:04.090" style="s2">then you run into people where you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.260" end="00:28:08.140" style="s2">say those things and no blowout occurs</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.090" end="00:28:10.830" style="s2">it&#39;s natural for you to gravitate so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.140" end="00:28:14.650" style="s2">most fascinating thing to me is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.830" end="00:28:17.380" style="s2">this brought people from so far afield</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.650" end="00:28:19.540" style="s2">from such different backgrounds of such</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.380" end="00:28:22.179" style="s2">different political perspective and</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.179" end="00:28:28.860" style="s2">extent of the IDW is a group what unites</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.419" end="00:28:34.950" style="s2">that group is the discovery of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.860" end="00:28:38.020" style="s2">toolkit for participating in incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.950" end="00:28:40.700" style="s2">difficult discussions and if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.020" end="00:28:46.250" style="s2">name those principles what</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.700" end="00:28:48.150" style="s2">well once you have established that your</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.250" end="00:28:50.460" style="s2">community in which you&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.150" end="00:28:53.390" style="s2">discussion is a good faith community in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.460" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">which essentially every person has</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.390" end="00:29:00.780" style="s2">agreed with the idea that they would</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:03.780" style="s2">rather lose if they have an incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.780" end="00:29:06.030" style="s2">argument than win in other words if your</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.780" end="00:29:10.760" style="s2">priority is getting to what is true and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.030" end="00:29:17.280" style="s2">that priority supersedes your own rise</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.760" end="00:29:21.090" style="s2">then you can do a great deal and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.280" end="00:29:24.120" style="s2">happens at that limit is you can assume</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.090" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">that the other people in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.120" end="00:29:29.460" style="s2">conversation are making a kind of sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:32.280" style="s2">and to the extent that they sound like</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.460" end="00:29:34.590" style="s2">they are not making a kind of sense you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.280" end="00:29:39.150" style="s2">know where to look you do not resort to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.590" end="00:29:41.700" style="s2">the accusation you are being absurd you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.150" end="00:29:43.799" style="s2">say I wonder why it is that when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.700" end="00:29:46.440" style="s2">through my ears what you have just said</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.799" end="00:29:48.150" style="s2">does not add up in the slightest so let</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.440" end="00:29:49.770" style="s2">me try out what I hear you saying and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.150" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">you tell me where I don&#39;t have it so</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.770" end="00:29:54.809" style="s2">that&#39;s the steel Manning aspect which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:58.650" style="s2">really a a formalization that has caught</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.809" end="00:30:01.410" style="s2">on of some instinctive process where in</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.650" end="00:30:03.330" style="s2">order to reach some new place with</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.410" end="00:30:06.030" style="s2">somebody you have to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.330" end="00:30:07.500" style="s2">they&#39;re saying not just enough to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.030" end="00:30:10.350" style="s2">counter it but you have to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.500" end="00:30:12.450" style="s2">well enough to know what really might</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.350" end="00:30:13.770" style="s2">actually be wrong with it which means</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.450" end="00:30:15.990" style="s2">you have to also know what&#39;s right with</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.770" end="00:30:20.850" style="s2">it so it is the I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.990" end="00:30:24.990" style="s2">overarching lis it is the question of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.850" end="00:30:29.370" style="s2">what role argument plays if argument is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.990" end="00:30:30.870" style="s2">a tool to accomplish political ends you</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.370" end="00:30:33.330" style="s2">can&#39;t have these conversations if</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.870" end="00:30:36.570" style="s2">argument is a tool to discover what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.330" end="00:30:39.480" style="s2">true from which might flow a political</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.570" end="00:30:43.040" style="s2">desire but it is not the motivating</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.480" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">force then you will act very differently</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.040" end="00:30:50.669" style="s2">as you argue you will argue from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">perspective of good faith and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.669" end="00:30:54.570" style="s2">if you&#39;re in a position to expect good</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:56.700" style="s2">faith from whoever you&#39;re arguing with</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.570" end="00:30:58.649" style="s2">you have the potential of both arriving</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.700" end="00:31:00.899" style="s2">at some place better than you start it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.649" end="00:31:04.620" style="s2">out you might both learn and that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.899" end="00:31:08.429" style="s2">know it&#39;s win-win and now the image of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.620" end="00:31:11.909" style="s2">Evergreen is very poor after what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.429" end="00:31:13.649" style="s2">happened what but I know that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.909" end="00:31:15.000" style="s2">spoken before about that there was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.649" end="00:31:17.669" style="s2">of really good stuff going on there a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.000" end="00:31:19.289" style="s2">lot of really inspiring stuff what are</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.669" end="00:31:23.370" style="s2">the other things that you would like to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.289" end="00:31:25.559" style="s2">see as the positive aspect of evergreens</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.370" end="00:31:27.480" style="s2">teaching style that you think we can all</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.559" end="00:31:29.580" style="s2">learn from well I&#39;ve thought a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.480" end="00:31:33.179" style="s2">this because it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.580" end="00:31:35.730" style="s2">evergreens model was half brilliant and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.179" end="00:31:37.470" style="s2">half crazy and there was no reason that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.730" end="00:31:40.139" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t take the crazy part and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.470" end="00:31:42.299" style="s2">eliminate it and have improved the model</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.139" end="00:31:44.610" style="s2">but there was something about treating</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.299" end="00:31:47.130" style="s2">the founding structure as sacred that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.610" end="00:31:49.649" style="s2">prevented the population of evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.130" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">from repairing itself which resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.649" end="00:32:00.450" style="s2">the blowing up the key factors that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">worked were an unparalleled level of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.450" end="00:32:05.309" style="s2">pedagogical freedom so professors really</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:07.230" style="s2">had carte blanche to teach what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.309" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">wanted how they wanted and that meant</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.230" end="00:32:13.159" style="s2">that people who wish to discover what</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:19.289" style="s2">was possible could could explore and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.159" end="00:32:22.250" style="s2">that was coupled with a that was coupled</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.289" end="00:32:25.500" style="s2">with a classroom structure in which</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.250" end="00:32:27.630" style="s2">students took one class full-time and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.500" end="00:32:30.059" style="s2">professors taught one class full-time</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.630" end="00:32:33.090" style="s2">and those classes could go on for two or</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.059" end="00:32:36.929" style="s2">three quarters in some cases what that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.090" end="00:32:39.570" style="s2">meant was that you had a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.929" end="00:32:41.880" style="s2">amount of high quality contact with your</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.570" end="00:32:44.760" style="s2">students so if you were dedicated to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.880" end="00:32:46.919" style="s2">job of teaching in some new way you knew</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.760" end="00:32:48.990" style="s2">exactly who you were teaching just at</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.919" end="00:32:51.269" style="s2">the level of every individual in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.990" end="00:32:55.529" style="s2">room was known to you that meant you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.269" end="00:32:58.679" style="s2">could track the blind spot that a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.529" end="00:33:00.090" style="s2">student had and you could work you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.679" end="00:33:02.279" style="s2">tailor what you were saying and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.090" end="00:33:03.940" style="s2">could try to make sure that it landed on</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.279" end="00:33:05.379" style="s2">a particular mind in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.940" end="00:33:07.509" style="s2">way that would cause some epiphany that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.379" end="00:33:09.879" style="s2">needed to happen I don&#39;t know of another</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.509" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">model in which that&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.879" end="00:33:17.919" style="s2">requires the freedom and the high</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:21.129" style="s2">intensity of contact between professors</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.919" end="00:33:23.710" style="s2">and students and if I was architecting a</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.129" end="00:33:25.059" style="s2">college in the aftermath of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.710" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">experience of teaching at Evergreen I</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.059" end="00:33:34.059" style="s2">would preserve those things above all</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:38.070" style="s2">others what I would do away with is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.059" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">mechanism for hiring professors and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.070" end="00:33:42.789" style="s2">recruiting students both of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:44.379" style="s2">mechanisms were badly broken and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.789" end="00:33:46.059" style="s2">meant that the population that arrived</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.379" end="00:33:47.980" style="s2">at Evergreen was not the right</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.059" end="00:33:51.549" style="s2">population to take advantage of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.980" end="00:33:55.210" style="s2">structures it was a haphazard mix so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.549" end="00:33:58.149" style="s2">main problem with hiring was that it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.210" end="00:34:02.049" style="s2">done by grouping faculty together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.149" end="00:34:04.149" style="s2">asking them what positions we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.049" end="00:34:06.519" style="s2">should hire rather than looking at whose</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.149" end="00:34:09.129" style="s2">classes were full and saying well if</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.519" end="00:34:11.319" style="s2">psychology is always full we need some</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.129" end="00:34:13.000" style="s2">more psychology professors now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.319" end="00:34:14.710" style="s2">an absolutist in this regard I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.000" end="00:34:16.780" style="s2">say that whatever the population coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.710" end="00:34:20.290" style="s2">to the college wants we should hire as</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.780" end="00:34:22.389" style="s2">many people as as it can handle but I do</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.290" end="00:34:24.010" style="s2">think within limits you need a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.389" end="00:34:26.349" style="s2">mechanism that tells you what is</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.369" end="00:34:34.780" style="s2">and my tuition money rather than walking</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.349" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">away saying what the hell was that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.780" end="00:34:39.310" style="s2">why did I spend 10 weeks on it so had</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:41.230" style="s2">there been a feedback mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.310" end="00:34:43.690" style="s2">caused that which worked to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.230" end="00:34:48.280" style="s2">propagated evergreen would have been a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.690" end="00:34:50.319" style="s2">much more effective place evergreen also</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.280" end="00:34:54.040" style="s2">had an almost complete disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.319" end="00:34:57.550" style="s2">between the admissions office and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.040" end="00:35:00.760" style="s2">recruiters and the faculty so we often</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.550" end="00:35:02.770" style="s2">as faculty had no idea how the college</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.760" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">was being advertised and to whom and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.770" end="00:35:09.400" style="s2">really Evergreen was largely advertised</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:12.760" style="s2">as a pretty liberal arts college on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.400" end="00:35:14.980" style="s2">Puget Sound when that was the last</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.760" end="00:35:16.750" style="s2">reason you should go there it was really</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.980" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">the place to go if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.750" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">had very high potential but you needed</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:24.010" style="s2">somebody to treat you as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:26.170" style="s2">because you weren&#39;t perhaps well built</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.010" end="00:35:27.460" style="s2">for school or you were capable of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.170" end="00:35:30.280" style="s2">something extraordinary that was going</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.460" end="00:35:33.250" style="s2">to require somebody to pay particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.280" end="00:35:34.869" style="s2">attention to your your skills those were</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.250" end="00:35:36.849" style="s2">reasons to go but they weren&#39;t anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.869" end="00:35:39.940" style="s2">in the recruiting materials so what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.849" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">got was a haphazard collection of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.940" end="00:35:43.869" style="s2">students Heather and I did very well in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:46.840" style="s2">this environment because our programs</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.869" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">were always oversubscribed and so in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.840" end="00:35:53.290" style="s2">sense although only rarely we&#39;ll be in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:54.760" style="s2">position to have an application for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.290" end="00:35:57.790" style="s2">program that would allow us to choose</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.760" end="00:36:00.340" style="s2">the best students for it we were in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.790" end="00:36:01.960" style="s2">position to discourage people who would</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.340" end="00:36:04.980" style="s2">not benefit from our programs and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.960" end="00:36:07.240" style="s2">encourage people who would benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.980" end="00:36:09.700" style="s2">when you get a room full of people that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.240" end="00:36:11.290" style="s2">are more or less there because either</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.700" end="00:36:13.000" style="s2">they think they need to hear what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.290" end="00:36:15.070" style="s2">saying or you think they might benefit</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.000" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">from it there&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.070" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">potential and Evergreen now has a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:26.200" style="s2">toxic reputation and it&#39;s better to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:28.330" style="s2">and but what are the what are the good</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.200" end="00:36:31.030" style="s2">parts of the Evergreen model that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.330" end="00:36:34.540" style="s2">think we can learn from we should learn</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.030" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">from we had time we had academic freedom</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.540" end="00:36:40.690" style="s2">and with those two things and good faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:42.730" style="s2">and you know like I said a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.690" end="00:36:44.349" style="s2">effectively has either a benevolent or</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.730" end="00:36:45.849" style="s2">an envelope monovalent dictator there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.349" end="00:36:47.230" style="s2">an authority figure no matter how much</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.849" end="00:36:50.890" style="s2">of the authority they want to turn away</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.230" end="00:36:54.490" style="s2">so in in my case I think I was always a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.890" end="00:36:58.119" style="s2">benevolent dictator basically enforcing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.490" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">rules of decency such that we had we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.119" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">never prioritized justice over truth but</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:08.770" style="s2">we got both because we did so because we</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:14.589" style="s2">investigated what was true with a sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.770" end="00:37:16.900" style="s2">of of care and compassion and most</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.589" end="00:37:19.450" style="s2">colleges and universities just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.900" end="00:37:23.020" style="s2">afford the time so study abroad trips</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.450" end="00:37:25.570" style="s2">where students will go for a month or</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.020" end="00:37:26.890" style="s2">two could but for the most part those</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.570" end="00:37:28.060" style="s2">are these one-off things where the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.890" end="00:37:28.610" style="s2">students aren&#39;t even from the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.060" end="00:37:29.990" style="s2">University</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.610" end="00:37:31.550" style="s2">till they show up somewhere far-flung</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.990" end="00:37:33.260" style="s2">and then they&#39;re mostly you know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.550" end="00:37:35.000" style="s2">they&#39;re in city is they&#39;re in someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.260" end="00:37:37.810" style="s2">dorms and it&#39;s it&#39;s it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.000" end="00:37:40.610" style="s2">really create community the same way so</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.810" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">really being able to dive deep with</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.610" end="00:37:45.530" style="s2">people and reveal truths about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:47.630" style="s2">not just what you think and how you</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.530" end="00:37:51.350" style="s2">think but also just about who you are as</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.630" end="00:37:55.010" style="s2">a person such that everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.350" end="00:37:57.170" style="s2">community is a little bit exposed and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.010" end="00:38:00.080" style="s2">once everyone&#39;s a little bit exposed and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.170" end="00:38:01.970" style="s2">you can see okay we have all trusted</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.080" end="00:38:04.750" style="s2">each other a little bit here and we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.970" end="00:38:08.090" style="s2">all therefore assuming that there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.750" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">safety in that I can afford to take</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.090" end="00:38:13.160" style="s2">intellectual risks and I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">be attacked for doing so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.160" end="00:38:20.180" style="s2">that&#39;s we were able to do year after</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">year after year so breath said it before</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.180" end="00:38:24.580" style="s2">but you know I was on sabbatical when</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">the protest happened at Evergreen and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.580" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">not a single one of the students who</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:31.430" style="s2">showed up to protest against him did</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:33.890" style="s2">here I know you know this this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.430" end="00:38:34.610" style="s2">our students who turned against us that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.890" end="00:38:36.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.610" end="00:38:39.710" style="s2">if that had happened that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.740" end="00:38:41.210" style="s2">totally different story and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.710" end="00:38:43.910" style="s2">would I would hope that you would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.210" end="00:38:46.250" style="s2">pushing back on my story of you know how</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.910" end="00:38:48.170" style="s2">effective this was right I give if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.250" end="00:38:50.450" style="s2">have legions of students or any even you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.170" end="00:38:52.130" style="s2">know a couple you know find out what</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.450" end="00:38:53.570" style="s2">their story is find out actually what it</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.130" end="00:38:55.340" style="s2">is that they&#39;re saying that disagrees</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.570" end="00:38:57.170" style="s2">with what wouldn&#39;t Bretton on my claim</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.340" end="00:39:00.770" style="s2">about what we were doing for 15 years on</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.170" end="00:39:03.380" style="s2">campus was and I&#39;m sure I know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.770" end="00:39:05.930" style="s2">that given that the college that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.380" end="00:39:08.630" style="s2">loved hired a PR firm to basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.930" end="00:39:10.310" style="s2">demonize Brett and then us that they if</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.630" end="00:39:12.470" style="s2">they could have found such students they</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.310" end="00:39:16.910" style="s2">would have and we&#39;d be hearing from them</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.470" end="00:39:22.040" style="s2">but they they haven&#39;t so the fact the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.910" end="00:39:25.100" style="s2">fact is that people become loyal when</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.040" end="00:39:27.080" style="s2">they are treated well and if you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.100" end="00:39:28.670" style="s2">treating people well in order to create</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.080" end="00:39:31.700" style="s2">loyalty that&#39;s not actually being</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.670" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">treated well and smart young people can</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.700" end="00:39:35.930" style="s2">see that and so actually action and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">smart everyone can see that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.930" end="00:39:40.349" style="s2">you&#39;re even more able to see that one</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:43.530" style="s2">year when you&#39;re young and fresh</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.349" end="00:39:46.260" style="s2">you&#39;ve just been no matter how good your</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.260" end="00:39:50.790" style="s2">had some just awful teachers who clearly</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.750" end="00:39:52.260" style="s2">disrespected them as individuals didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.790" end="00:39:54.750" style="s2">really believe in their humanity didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.260" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">really think much of them kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.750" end="00:39:57.450" style="s2">hoping to be done with it so they could</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:39:59.190" style="s2">you know would tire whenever they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.190" end="00:40:04.349" style="s2">whatever it was and at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.190" end="00:40:08.849" style="s2">students show up in a classroom and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.349" end="00:40:11.250" style="s2">faculty says I know you&#39;ve had awful</p>
