<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.980" style="s2">so hello everyone um I just thought that</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:06.569" style="s2">it might be a good idea to make a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">video recording and share it in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.569" end="00:00:12.420" style="s2">group to give you a sense of how things</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">are emerging here in body Chara and</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.420" end="00:00:16.500" style="s2">Columbia where we are as it relates to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">everything we&#39;ve discussed in this study</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">group because right now in the midst of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">this time when there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.390" end="00:00:27.470" style="s2">disruptions to people&#39;s normal routines</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:30.630" style="s2">there are opportunities to co-create</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.470" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">different social arrangements as they</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.630" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">relate to extractive and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">activities that people were complicit in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">through no fault of their own by</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:42.930" style="s2">participating in the dominant economy</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.100" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">and now they&#39;re opening up to new</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:46.620" style="s2">possibilities and I wanted to just tell</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">you a little bit about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.620" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">here in party chara because I think we</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">can learn a lot from it so just to give</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">you a brief context we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.949" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">northern Andes of Colombia in a place</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a tropical dry forest so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">means that it rains for about three</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">months of the year and then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">extended dry season for about nine</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">months of the year and this is a place</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">as you&#39;ve probably gathered from other</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:13.409" style="s2">posts that has at extreme deforestation</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">has problems with water quality and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.409" end="00:01:19.070" style="s2">water scarcity but at the same time has</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">a very rich in deep cultural history of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.070" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">campesino culture where the campesinos</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:26.100" style="s2">are farmers who live out in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">countryside growing their own food and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.100" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">lot of them have already been bringing</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">their vegetables and their produce into</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:35.790" style="s2">town to sell in some of the local shops</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">so that there is a bit of a local food</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.790" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">system that&#39;s very well integrated in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">this place what I want to share</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:42.229" style="s2">specifically right now is something</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">that&#39;s happened in the last three days</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.229" end="00:01:47.579" style="s2">when a group was created on what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:49.970" style="s2">and for those of you who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.579" end="00:01:52.680" style="s2">what&#39;s up is the most common</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.970" end="00:01:54.689" style="s2">communication tool used across Latin</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.680" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">America so people organize themselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.689" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">into groups and its really how most</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">information gets shared but a whatsup</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">group was created around discussions for</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">community resilience the idea being that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:12.420" style="s2">the people organizing this group would</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:15.209" style="s2">like to initiate and facilitate the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.420" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">the process of transformation and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.209" end="00:02:18.930" style="s2">reason that chosen three months is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:21.569" style="s2">right now we&#39;re entering into a lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.930" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">as it relates to the corona virus</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.569" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">pandemic trying to stop the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:28.020" style="s2">the disease which is having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:30.330" style="s2">economic effects immediately but we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.020" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">know from the projections of future</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.330" end="00:02:34.890" style="s2">change in many countries around the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:37.670" style="s2">world that about a month from now there</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.890" end="00:02:41.489" style="s2">will begin to be chronic and persistent</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.670" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">global system problems as all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.489" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">different countries have been locking</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:47.459" style="s2">down and shutting down transport and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">mobility of people and things like this</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.459" end="00:02:53.489" style="s2">so we&#39;re also in a time where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">about to begin the rainy season and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.489" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have a very limited window</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:59.819" style="s2">of time for two to three months where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:03.420" style="s2">could build systems for water retention</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.819" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">and direct them into food production to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.420" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">create food security during the nine to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">ten months of dry season afterwards and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:13.140" style="s2">about three months from now as when that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:14.220" style="s2">rainy season is likely to end because</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">it&#39;s just about to begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.220" end="00:03:18.150" style="s2">so we have about three months to do as</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:20.549" style="s2">much as we can to transform this system</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:22.260" style="s2">and what&#39;s happening is a group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.549" end="00:03:25.470" style="s2">facilitators have created their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.260" end="00:03:28.260" style="s2">whatsup group to discuss processes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.470" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">tools in what we&#39;re learning as we go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.260" end="00:03:32.609" style="s2">direct into the main community</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">resilience group as well as other</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.609" end="00:03:38.130" style="s2">focused groups that are looking at food</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">security for one group education because</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.130" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">all of the kids are out of school and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a need to learn new skills this</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:46.140" style="s2">is an education focus and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:48.870" style="s2">primary focus right now is alternative</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.140" end="00:03:51.060" style="s2">economic models so for example there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.870" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">an activity going going on in the third</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.060" end="00:03:55.319" style="s2">group to map out who are the local</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">people that produce food and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.319" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">connect them to small clusters of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">families that become group buyers of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">that food so it might be that four or</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">five families agreed to buy the yuca</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.940" style="s2">plant from one farmer or four or five</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">families might agree to buy all the eggs</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.940" end="00:04:14.100" style="s2">from one farmer to make it very</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">efficient to distribute food to people</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.100" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">and create stable food security but also</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:21.780" style="s2">this is a mapping process so we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:24.210" style="s2">begin to see at the landscape scale what</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.780" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">are the capabilities for food production</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.210" end="00:04:30.449" style="s2">so this is all happening emergently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:32.750" style="s2">messy there&#39;s a lot of confusion as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.449" end="00:04:36.120" style="s2">official Colombian government is</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.750" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">initiating a three-week long quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.120" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">obligating people to remain in their</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:43.139" style="s2">homes and so we&#39;re bringing together the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:46.020" style="s2">collective knowledge of this place</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.139" end="00:04:47.550" style="s2">through self-organizing activities and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.020" end="00:04:50.340" style="s2">just want to share this with you to give</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.550" end="00:04:52.650" style="s2">you a sense that while it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.340" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">take care of our own families to limit</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.650" end="00:04:56.550" style="s2">the contagion effects of spreading the</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:03.560" style="s2">phenomenon there&#39;s also a tremendous</p>

<p begin="00:05:03.560" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">for collective intelligence to</p>

<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:15.810" style="s2">of deforested land and all of the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:18.150" style="s2">who have different kinds of food</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:19.830" style="s2">production water storage skills and</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:29.610" style="s2">so we&#39;ve my wife just in the food group</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:31.289" style="s2">offered to collect food from producers</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.720" end="00:05:38.490" style="s2">that is coordinating a time of day where</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">people do a movement meditation in their</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.490" end="00:05:42.509" style="s2">homes to create solidarity between</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:44.669" style="s2">people and they&#39;ll use what&#39;s up to</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.669" end="00:05:49.050" style="s2">movements together and meditating about</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.590" end="00:05:57.449" style="s2">very dynamic and generative time but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.280" end="00:06:01.770" style="s2">want to share this with you to give you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.449" end="00:06:05.460" style="s2">a feel for what is possible as old</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.770" end="00:06:09.539" style="s2">routines break down and new patterns</p>
