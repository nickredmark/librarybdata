<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">with your everyday consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">perhaps by reciting the five promises</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">and we will begin the dharma</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">a background today for an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">you should be reading through the second</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">degree in the mclaren book the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">lipatia</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">but let&#39;s begin and as always</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.160" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">we begin with the exemplary figure of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:40.320" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">and we went uh through the channel to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">epicurus this time we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">another one of his disciples we of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">course will end with his greatest</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">disciple</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">which is who is plato but here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">very important one</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">and this is antisthenes</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">he was a follower of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">and unlike he wrote stuff but he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:05.919" style="s2">put as much</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">emphasis on theory and argumentation as</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.919" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">plato did</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">and so people asked him well what did</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">what did you learn from socrates and he</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">said something</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">that is either extremely trivial</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">or extremely profound depending on your</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">reaction to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">and what did he say he what he said is i</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">learned how to converse</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">with myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">and of course this is the logos dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:41.280" style="s2">all right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">one of the things we may say is big deal</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.280" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">i talk to myself all day long</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">and i take it and most people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">followed</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">and destinies took it that he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">mean that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.799" style="s2">he meant something that is a radical</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.799" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">of how we talk to ourselves all day long</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">but let&#39;s ask a question um that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:06.000" style="s2">really asked here</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">at least directly but is asked directly</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">very much in modern cognitive sciences</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">and even in modern uh psychotherapy why</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">do we talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">sorry not to each other why do we talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">all day long and you could see that i</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">leaping ahead a little bit of my</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">thinking it has to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:32.080" style="s2">that we of course learn to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">by talking to other people and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.080" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">here&#39;s an interesting thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">becoming more and more the case</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">in in the sense that we&#39;re realizing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">more and more to be true</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">the brain&#39;s relationship to itself your</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">brain&#39;s relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">itself is a mesh overlaps with is often</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">not distinguished from</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">your brain&#39;s relationship to other</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">brains so</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">one way of thinking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking and you&#39;re making sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">is not primarily monological</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:11.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not a monologue it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">primarily dialogical</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.760" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">that in order to think we think best</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">when we think</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">dialogically</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s more and more evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">we are actually better</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing that in actual dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:28.880" style="s2">and we&#39;ll talk about this when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">talk about the neoplatonic practice of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.880" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">which is using this relationship of how</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">we talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">and how we talk to ourselves in order to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">gauge</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">in significant transformation</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s remember this</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">cognition is inherently dialogical even</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">though our culture</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">pretends and it is a very significant</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">form of bullshitting pretense</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">that we are monological beings uh that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">that&#39;s how our thinking primarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">operates and works um we carry around</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">in our heads all day long and some of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">you might have</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">encountered that aspect a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">more saliently</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">in some of the practices uh we do with</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">meditative inquiry um and meta and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">uh the five factors inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">mindfulness etc okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">this idea that we&#39;re inherently</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">dialogical and of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">socrates models that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">um so plato writes dialogues in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">is in discussion and sock and will come</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">back to this point</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">socrates makes a continual argument he</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:46.159" style="s2">makes it repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:49.919" style="s2">that his dialoguing with other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.159" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">and his process of self-examination are</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:51.919" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">nor they&#39;re not one in the same but</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">they&#39;re completely out one with each</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">they&#39;re mutually independent trading</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">mutually uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">affording of each other all right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.840" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">let&#39;s pick this up</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">so the idea here is we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">all day long our thinking is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">biological</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">now what that means i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">something here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s intended to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">provocative i&#39;m tutored</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">right untutored inner dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">is better than</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">no no dialogue at all</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">okay that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">we do it because it&#39;s adaptive um it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">really uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">helps our cognition uh when you meet</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">unfortunate individuals that haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:53.520" style="s2">that proper</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">engagement uh with dialogue and socially</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.520" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">uh they are seriously truncated uh as</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">uh cognitive agents it&#39;s questionable</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">um not in a moral sense but in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">metaphysical sense whether they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">persons</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">uh so this is why we do it we do it</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">because we have internalized</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to that remember when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">talked about internalizing this age we</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">have internalized the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">uh to generate thought through speech</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">by speaking with others and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">listening to others and then we can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">uh with ourselves so this is better than</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">no dialogue at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">but and this is a very important but</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">you know this is a stoic principle evil</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come from when we choose what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">evil comes when we choose a lesser good</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">in place of a greater good</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">untutored dialogue is better than no</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">dialogue at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">it&#39;s adaptive but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">optimal or the best for</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">us because</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">most of this inner dialogue is narrative</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">in nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">and we practice narrative and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">daniel hudo&#39;s idea we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.880" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">practicing narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">we constantly teaching our kids</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">narrative when we simplify narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">natural to us we have to practice it we</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">use dialogue to get good at narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">and then we internalize it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">and we start to see ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">identify with ourselves as a story</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">we&#39;re a story and there&#39;s a story going</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">on here right and this is narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">also very adaptive narrative allows you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">to identify with your future self</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">and your past it creates a temporally</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">extended itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">which is great for planning it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">for long-term moral responsibility you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">can hold me responsible</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">for something that i did 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">because there is a narrative identity</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">between me now</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">and that person then again narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">adaptive it&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">right but the problem with narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">right is</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">it creates a narrative bias</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">see people are hungry for narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">like anything that&#39;s adaptive and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">hunger for</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">it can be hijacked in an addictive</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">fashion so what i mean by people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">hungry for narrative</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">well there&#39;s some horrible event on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">news and what do people need</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">they need to know yeah what&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">what&#39;s the story what&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">and then once they get the story there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">like oh okay it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">the the the consequences of what that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">world will event haven&#39;t disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">but now there&#39;s a story and what what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">we see</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">is that what narrative tends to do is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">tends to create a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">whole bunch of biases along with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">narrative drives the narrative bias</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">uh i hope that this blue is still</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">fizzled is this still okay the blue</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">that&#39;s still good okay it drives</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">so the confirmation bias is and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">going to need this when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">um active open-mindedness confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">bias is our tendency to only look for</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">evidence that confirms</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">what we believe right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">when people get a story they will tend</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">only notice and find relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">salient things that fit their story</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">and they will tend to ignore any of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">evidence that could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">challenge it</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">so an obvious case where the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">bias is driving the confirmation bias is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">conspiracy theory thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">where people think they have some story</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">that makes sense of everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">and then they engage in the confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">the other thing that that this drives is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">it drives</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">over estimation biases</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">and these interact with each other by</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">the way these two biases</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">the overestimation bias is people think</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">when they have a story</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">they have all of the information about a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">particular situation</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.919" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">and they also overestimate how how</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">good they are at making sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">so all of these biases kick in again</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">this is right these they are precisely</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:15.600" style="s2">powerful biases because they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">hijacking something that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.600" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">adaptive in nature</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.279" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">but maybe we can do better</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">the other problem with the another way</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">in which the inner dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">often goes off the rails is rumination</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">you know what this is like when you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">in in an anxiety spiral</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">and you get all these biases also</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">spinning on each other and you keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">thinking in a way that&#39;s driving your</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:46.080" style="s2">anxiety you can&#39;t let it go</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:47.120" style="s2">or your depression and you start to spin</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">in rumination</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.120" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">this is a very powerful driver of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">anxiety and depression</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very complicated process but</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">it is very much driven by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">that your cognition is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">dialogical in nature so</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">i&#39;m tutored it&#39;s adaptive one more time</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s adaptive that&#39;s why we do it</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s so compelling and addictive</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">also because it&#39;s so adaptive and like</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">that is adaptive it can become</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">so the stoics are right the cynics and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">the followers of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">socrates were looking at this and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">especially antisthenes and his followers</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">and they were saying all right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">problem so what anticipates is basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">when i learned how to converse with</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">myself is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">untutored inner dialogue generates</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">bad judgment untutored inner dial</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not coming from socrates i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">tutored inner dialogue is driving</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">bad judgment</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">bad judgment</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to deal with again</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">cognition is inherently dialogical and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">is adaptive and because we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">incul enculturated narrative into us</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">because that&#39;s so adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">the ways in which that goes wrong are so</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">addictive and compelling and hard to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:22.799" style="s2">deal with</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">we get bad judgment now we need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.799" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">understand the way the stoics are using</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">this term</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">in order to do that we have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">the group of people that first</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">came out of antisthenes</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">so the line goes from socrates to and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">tiff&#39;s the knees and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">he right so antisthenes is</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">uh the person i&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">the learning to converse with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">and then he</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">has students that and one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">famous</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">of his students is</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">diogenes and diogenes is a cynic</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.399" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">now we we use this word incorrectly</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">in a degenerative fashion we think</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s cynical because they</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">they don&#39;t believe in anything there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">secret agenda that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">what the ancient meaning of cynicism was</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:24.200" style="s2">it shows you how our culture really</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.200" end="00:32:30.120" style="s2">misunderstands its own wisdom tradition</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">they are the way in which it has</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">okay so diogenes he&#39;s famous you</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">probably know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">he was on that one of the covers of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">he&#39;s figuring the tarot you know the</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">in a minute but what the cynics like</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">following entities slot the bad judgment</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">mean by bad judgment</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">well when we hear judgment we hear</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">belief what you believe but again</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">we have lost a lot of this uh let&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">comes from a german word right</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">believe in which translates</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">as beloved it&#39;s what you set your heart</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">on that&#39;s what judgment is</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not generate it&#39;s not primarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">generating belief</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">how do we now understand it sentences or</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">this is the act of setting your heart on</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">the idea here is that this is very much</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">uh dweck&#39;s work which we&#39;ll talk about</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">on uh mindsets the way we set our mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">and set our heart</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">which is not the same thing as just</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">having a set of beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">so think about when you what we mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">when we say you set your heart on</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.799" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">something it&#39;s beloved by us</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">um so we&#39;re finding it particularly</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">relevant and salient and important</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">we&#39;re binding our identity to it when</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">don&#39;t just have beliefs about them</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">oh yes i believe they&#39;re a good person i</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">believe that of course you have beliefs</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:23.440" style="s2">just have beliefs about them there is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.440" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">of what you find relevant salient</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">important identification</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">and you begin to internalize that person</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">and allow them to shape your identity in</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">a profound</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">way okay that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">with judgment here</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about simply the act</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">of coming to certain beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about something much</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:49.359" style="s2">deeper and more profound</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">and the cynics argued</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.359" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">that what&#39;s what our bad judgment is</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">is we set our heart on the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what cynicism originally meant</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">so what the cynics thought is that most</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">people set their hearts</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">on things that are created by social</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">convention</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">rather than on natural or moral law and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">then the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">because social conventions change and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">shift around</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">and are not ultimately grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">deeply rational we will ultimately be</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">when we set our heart on things that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">created by social convention</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">so diogenes what&#39;s he doing with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">lamp</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">well he&#39;s in the marketplace right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">he&#39;s doing this provocative thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting uh about um uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">the the kind of thing that&#39;s uh diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">doing he&#39;s not really offering</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:47.359" style="s2">argument like socrates is and that shows</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">us another side of socrates that we tend</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">to forget</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">he&#39;s instead really trying to do this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">provocative he&#39;s almost doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">performance art and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">trying to provoke people he&#39;s carrying</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">this lamp around looking for</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">what and people are what are you looking</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">forward to these and you won&#39;t tell them</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">well what are you looking for</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">and they&#39;re in their mom they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">marketplace and they&#39;re doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">stuff what are you looking for what are</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">you looking for come on</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">and then he says i&#39;m looking for one</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">honest person</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">so people are in the marketplace and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">they&#39;re seeking and seeking and looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re looking for all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">most of it is you know think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">saying think about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">entity that we all set our hearts on</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">money only exists by social convention</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">if you take out a coin</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">look at it remember this if we all agree</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">remember that it doesn&#39;t have any actual</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">inherent value</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s what sometimes happens right</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">people panic and realize oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">this stuff doesn&#39;t really exist and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">it all collapses and falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">right so people are in the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">and but what they&#39;re not concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">is something</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">that has intrinsic value honesty</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">honesty and this comes from something in</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">fact socrates is famous for doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">he walked into the marketplace and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">said oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">look at all the things i don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.200" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">so what the cynics engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">is two things together uh social</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">renunciation</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">and social provocation and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">trying to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">with that with that so the renunciation</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">the provocation are trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">about two things</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">right so you sort of trying to start</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">working together to bring about</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">so you have the social renunciation</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s renunce oh enunciation i</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">believe that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">and then social provocation like what i</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.760" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">just described with diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">that sort of performance art both of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">these are working together</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">to create an existential reframing</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">people fundamentally reframing their</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">of the agent arena relationship their</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">identity their existential mode</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">we talked a lot about that when we</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">talked about meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">and reciprocal opening so</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">diagrams for example left athens and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">lived</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">outside of the city in a barrel famously</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">um this is where this comes from cynic</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">means living like a dog</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">right that&#39;s what it actually means so</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">so the cynics did not want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">set their hearts on all these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">that are created by social convention</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">kind of like sort of hippies right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">so they they</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">they they lived outside the city um and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">then they would</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">and then they also did provocative</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">things because they were trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">people to really</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">existentially reframe and alter what</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">they find</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">relevant salient and important what they</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:53.839" style="s2">identify with</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:14.640" style="s2">diogenes and alexander says i am</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">alexander and alexander was very much</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.640" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">about creating this whole mythos</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">of him being a god man and he says to</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">right social pronunciation social</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">really refrain uh people</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting about this right</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">is the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">noted that there&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">contradiction well this is very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s famous pictures of diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">in the barrel</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">and like i said carrying the lamp have</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">become you know regular</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.720" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">icons in our culture of people often</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">don&#39;t even know why</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">the fact that it was on the left</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">zeppelin album and in the tarot i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">is something very very important</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">okay so what did the stoics so there was</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">a guy named zeno and he was influenced</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">the cynics but he also loved plato and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">he thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">we needed to put together the two sides</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">entities and the aspect of socrates that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">had come from plato</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">and he picked up on a a a problem within</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">cynicism and this is the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">cynics paid</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">too much attention to the objects</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">of bad judgment and not enough attention</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">to the process of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">too much emphasis and we do this this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">one of our besetting</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">cognitive biases we pay too much</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">objects of our thought and the products</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">of our thought and very little attention</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">to the processes of our thinking of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">so the stoics said</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">we will talk about this but we want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">put</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">much more emphasis on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">the process because it&#39;s not what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">setting your heart on</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">because they realize that this</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">that judgment can be on about anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">or practically anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">it&#39;s more the process of how you</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">set your heart upon things</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:33.920" style="s2">all right so what&#39;s the process</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">of that they&#39;re interested in well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.920" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">a process you&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a process that we have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">it is the process of and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">i used if you remember at the time when</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">we were doing the meditation course i</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">referenced the stoics it&#39;s the process</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">of co-identification</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">that i identification i&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">doing this in a interdependent conjoined</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">i am assuming an identity as an agent</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">and i&#39;m assigning identity to identities</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">to things</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">as an arena so right now i&#39;m the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">you&#39;re the student</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">etc this is a classroom i&#39;m assuming and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">assigning identities and i&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">mo i&#39;m doing it largely unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">automatically and reactively and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">remember i gave you this little acronym</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">i&#39;m doing it mindlessly</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:31.920" style="s2">i&#39;m doing it automatically and i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">reactively and that is what is marring</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.920" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">my judgment</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.800" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">that is what is marring my judgment</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">and so this is all about the existential</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">modes</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">so the stoics and it we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">this when we&#39;re talking about meta</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">actually noted that there are two kinds</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">of modes remember that eric from got</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">this from the stoix</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">there is the having mode</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:02.319" style="s2">and the being mode they are both</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.319" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">do you remember so this is about needs</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">that are met by having</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">consuming and controlling and i treat</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">things categorically so they</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">can efficiently and effectively uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">consume them and control them and i</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">right so this marker is like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">previous marker and so i can exchange</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">that marker that&#39;s running out of ink</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">with this one and i could because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">marker i can quickly control it and use</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">it for what i need to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">that&#39;s great so this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">primarily about control</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">but there are needs that are met not by</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">controlling or consuming their needs are</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.160" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">met by</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">by transformation and development so</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">these are developmental needs these are</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">needs like becoming honest being an</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">honest person</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">being an honest person and these are</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">these don&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">uh they&#39;re not self-terminating the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">like when i drink enough water i drink</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">enough water but i never get to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">place where i say i&#39;m honest enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t need to be you know i don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">to work on being honest</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:04.800" style="s2">right that&#39;s a very dangerous place to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:07.599" style="s2">get to when you start to talk that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.800" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">all right so what the the stoics did is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">and from this what from god and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">talked about this so how you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">meta contemplation is about learning to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">discern</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">and distinguish between these two and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">the being mode remember stephen bachelor</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">argued that buddhism is all about</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">remembering the being mode satin</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">is that deep remembering of the being</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">all right so</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">the stoics take it deeper than i</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.839" end="00:44:35.599" style="s2">presented it because i was just</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">presenting</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.599" end="00:44:40.560" style="s2">how it would help understanding meta and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">buddhism at the time but the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">really go in here</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">and they say no no we&#39;re going to deepen</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">this ability to disturb</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">and distinguish between these we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">going to really help you get better at</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">dealing with modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">all right so what do they do well</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.119" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">here&#39;s the and curiodon</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">the manual for living by epictetus one</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.119" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">notice those two together by the way we</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">always think of stoicism as sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">dollar no</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">happiness and freedom begin with a clear</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">understanding of</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">what the story say is one way in which</p>

<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">get into deep modal confusion is we</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">are deeply deluded about what&#39;s in our</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">facts which one is the proliferation of</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">and the other is the fatality of all</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">okay so here is a fact we all know to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">and yet we ignore it almost moment by</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">most of our plans fail and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">time we are disappointed with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">results of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">not always but most of the time we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">frustrated and we fail in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">things don&#39;t go as planned</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">why well this has to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">we like we&#39;re gonna do action a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">and we intend for it to have consequence</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">b</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.000" style="s2">great the problem is and think about</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">this when you take</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.000" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">medication there are always</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">side effects there are always side</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">effects and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">the side effects outnumber the intended</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">effects this is one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">we&#39;re facing when we&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">we just do an an action and we know what</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">the intended effect is</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">but right there&#39;s all these side effects</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">and we some we</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">pay attention to some of them and ignore</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">most of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s key to our intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">then here&#39;s the problem when</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">b occurs b not only produces what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">might foresee</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">c it produces this and each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">is right and you see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:04.319" style="s2">you get the proliferation of side</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">effects</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.319" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">and so for the stoics trying to control</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t act but</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">thinking that you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">move the world that&#39;s how they often put</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">mostly delusional again they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:22.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not quietest</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">member outer effectiveness you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.160" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">so what you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">is you need to enhance your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">the relevant side effects not just the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">intention not just where the stories not</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">whether you&#39;re interest</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this in oh story this is how</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">that&#39;s okay that&#39;s this this but you</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.319" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">need to open up your ability to zero in</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">on much more of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">acknowledge how much of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">you do not have control over</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.240" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">so let&#39;s take something that i work with</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">daily</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">oh surely i have control over my my own</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:00.559" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">the stoics are saying no you don&#39;t and i</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.559" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">have meniere&#39;s disease right now</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s challenging me right now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">feeling a little bit of vertigo right</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">right and i have that i can do things i</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">things that make a difference i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.240" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">but i can&#39;t control all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">it it&#39;s beyond me even aspects of my</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">now this is not to put you into despair</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">okay so hang on for hang on to this</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">what&#39;s the fatality of all things the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">fatality of all things is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">the universe is so complex remember what</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">it talked about about narrative bias</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">the universe is way beyond our narrative</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">so there we have our stories</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">and we think these are this is the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">things are running</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">and romantic comedies really seduce us</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:51.040" style="s2">into this and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:51.839" style="s2">the universe and our stories yep the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.040" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.839" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">the fatality of death is death is fatal</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">it is fate it is an</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">aspect of fate remember we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">this meaning that death comes</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.119" style="s2">independent of how great your narrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">is you can have met</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.119" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">this wonderful woman who you adore and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">and is lifting your heart as no other</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">person has</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">and you step into traffic and you hit my</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.839" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">truck</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">the truck doesn&#39;t go oh well john has</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">finally found</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:24.559" style="s2">the love of his life choc ichi</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">it&#39;s fatal it&#39;s absurd and camus made a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.559" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">big deal of this right</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">so when we the the stoics and this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">kind of harsh this is where you get the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">idea of the stiff upper lip of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">the stomachs want to hold up in our face</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">this is diogenes holding up the lamp</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">pay attention to the way things really</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">are pay attention to the way things</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">really are</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">so what is in our control</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:51:01.599" style="s2">our judgment so the thing we take when</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">we focus on the object</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.599" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to try and control the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">we&#39;re actually probably going to lose to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">a large degree for all the reasons i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">just said</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">and what what we don&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">what we&#39;re transparent what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">looking</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">through is our judgment but we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">exercise tremendous control over over a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">if we properly train it if we properly</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">train it</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">so again what&#39;s our judgment mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">setting our heart on something</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:34.800" style="s2">what we find relevant what we find</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">salient how we identify</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.800" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">how we create identities agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">relationships existential modes</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">and the the the stoics have this term</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">pros</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">which means paying attention to how you</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">pay attention it&#39;s one of their</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">fundamental principles</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">paying attention to how you pay</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">attention which is why a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">compare stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">to mindfulness and buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">okay so what you want to do is get to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:11.200" style="s2">where you are</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:11.200" style="s2">right realizing that meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">in the sense of what you find relevant</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">and salient and identified with is</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">much more in your control and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">what that means is also meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">proper to the being mode that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">meat being mode is all about</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">is a way of getting you to right</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">shift into the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">and the idea here is we can do this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">better remember we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">the stoics have a very similar thing</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">which is learning to flow with nature</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">but you didn&#39;t think about that in</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.079" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">connection with stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">joy and learning to flow with nature</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">so what we have to do in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.599" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">properly tutor</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">our what follows from this and what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:28.960" style="s2">have to do to properly tutor our</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:31.200" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.960" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">is we have to make we have to learn in</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.200" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">our attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.720" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">to make a distinction between events</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">and our judgments about the events</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">because they are almost always and this</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">is what narrative does</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">they&#39;re almost always confused together</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">they&#39;re confused together so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">get better</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">at tracking</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">how things are actually unfolding we</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.079" end="00:54:04.880" style="s2">have to get better</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">at tracking reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.880" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">as much as possible we want what we find</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:11.200" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">to as much as possible track what is</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.200" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">and remember that doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:25.359" style="s2">mean what comes most readily or easily</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">to us so this</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.359" end="00:54:33.200" style="s2">is the stoic practice of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:33.200" style="s2">rationality here doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">inference control primarily like or or</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">just being logical</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">the stoics actually put three things</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">together logic</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">ethics and physics</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">and logic is much more like psychologic</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">learning an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">for enhancing and improving your</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">capacity for judgment your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">make relevance track what is most real</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very hard thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.160" style="s2">a better way to think about this is more</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">like the logos</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">getting finding make those patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">that are relevant to us but also track</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">the real patterns in the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">and leave and here&#39;s the thing logos</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">your ability to discern</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">and be aware of the logos is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:33.119" style="s2">dependent</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">on your inner dia logos your inner</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">dialogue your inner dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">how do we transform our inner dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">i&#39;ll just briefly indicate what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">going to talk about next time and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">and then give you some ideas about some</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:10.240" style="s2">practices we&#39;re going to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">so the basic idea and one way you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.240" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">all of stoicism is stoicism is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">practice of internalizing socrates this</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:21.280" style="s2">goes right back to entities</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">we talked about internalizing the sage</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:25.839" style="s2">how do we internalize socrates</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">so that we can transform our inner deal</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.839" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">so that we can become more rational so</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">that our ability to set our hearts more</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">reliably tracks</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">the real patterns and so that we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">we are more reliably within the being</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">and that we are more reliably free from</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.119" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">frustration despair and disappointment</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">and free to experience and drink from</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">the depths of the being mode itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">next time</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about what socratic</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:02.079" style="s2">self-knowledge looks like</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:04.079" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to notice the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.079" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">connections we can reach back to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.079" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">philosophical contemplated</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:08.960" style="s2">companionships</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">and reach forward we&#39;ll look forward</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.960" end="00:57:13.359" style="s2">foreshadowing</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">platonic uh dialectic and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.359" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">start talking about practices for how we</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:18.480" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">how do we cultivate uh rationality well</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.480" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">active open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">but we&#39;re also going to teach you how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">do that uh how</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">and this internalization it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">involve perspectival transformation</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">i&#39;m going to teach you about the view</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">from above objective</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">seeing the pre-meditation we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">take a look</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">at some of the stoic spiritual exercises</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">from buzari</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s what&#39;s coming it&#39;s so exciting</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s so enriching</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">i i think i trespassed a little bit on</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">our time for questions today</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">i&#39;ll make sure next time to uh to uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:53.440" style="s2">end a little bit earlier but i needed i</p>

<p begin="00:57:54.960" end="00:57:58.799" style="s2">uh for trespassing a little bit into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:57:59.280" style="s2">question time we&#39;ll make sure that we uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.799" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">we i</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.280" end="00:58:03.839" style="s2">i set aside 15 minutes next saturday uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">to address the questions that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.839" end="00:58:06.720" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">probably mounting um so we&#39;re just going</p>

<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">stoicism has a lot to offer us i i have</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:20.799" style="s2">a lot of books</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">i would recommend getting the interior</p>
