<p begin="00:00:56.480" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">titled</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">maybe some sort of direction for this</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">conversation as</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">exodus from the old empire which are</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:06.080" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">fascinating as well so and it has a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">double meaning of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">because none of us none of us is english</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">and none of us is american</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">so it seems we&#39;ve we&#39;ve exited</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">both uh empires in this case uh one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">us is a canadian one of us is south</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">africa one is in australia and we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">let the audience guess who&#39;s which right</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">well i left england when i was 11. so if</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:29.439" style="s2">we&#39;re playing the national identity game</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">then i&#39;d i&#39;d still go for england in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.439" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">game of football or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">but um but i&#39;m like you did your exodus</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">you did your accident yeah exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">you done it you left you left the old</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">world and you&#39;re in the new</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">world now yeah but we&#39;re not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">talking about going to new nation states</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">really at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">i think um after reading your books</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">alexander the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">the depth of the change that you speak</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">and the kind of um the fundamentality of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">the shift</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">in uh environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">that we find ourselves interacting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">living in is one which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:08.080" style="s2">deeper broader than something which can</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">be encapsulated</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.080" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">by the nation state so be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">interesting to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">get a sense of in the in the from</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:19.120" style="s2">from the big picture when when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.120" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">exodus when you&#39;re talking about exodus</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">where are we now and where are we</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">potentially going to well okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">so human beings either operate through</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">genes or memes</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">um and the genetic is also tied to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">physical territory</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">okay so as long as we could expand on</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">this planet and just conquer new</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">territory</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">regardless of who we killed in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">process we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">and what cerakus now are claiming is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">that that whole process</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">reached an abrupt end in the late 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">so ironically 1950s we were in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">shadow of the second world war</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">uh we just created the atomic bomb which</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">meant we just realized that we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">kill ourselves in a second</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">uh but also the late 1950s china</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">conquered tibet</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">and the united states literally</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">conquered hawaii</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">so whenever i hear americans you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">talk about china has to get out to bed</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">always remind the americans</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">you should get out of hawaii first you</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">hypocrites right so we had the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">territories that were conquered in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">a repetition of that achievement if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">consider that a successful achievement</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">which i think it is from an imperial</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">point of view certain years</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">china got tibet and america got hawaii</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">but 10 years later</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the moon landing and the moon</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">landing has</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">you know been axiomatically celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">ever since</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">like a great achievement that human</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">beings managed to set foot on the moon</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">if we look at it realistically if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">look at world the world economy over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">last say 50 to 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">we discovered that the moonlight was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">probably the most terrible project human</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">beings have ever undertaken in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">just wasting money on absolutely nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">so three guys dance around on the moon</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">and the cost</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">for each step of those guys dancing</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">around the moon is like hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">billions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">which could have you know decreased</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">poverty status from current climate</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">change and all kinds of problems you</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">could have avoided if you spent the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">money more wisely</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">so apparently we stopped being wise</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">quite a long time ago like after 1945 we</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">went cuckoo</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">we weren&#39;t twice before that because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">created hitler and stalin and mao before</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">but certainly the response hitler</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">installed him out was to go completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">infantile</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">youth oriented sex obsessed hating</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">throwing wisdom out through the door and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">instead going for something incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">infantile</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">and the fact that we can&#39;t even see that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">end of the exodus towards the new</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">territory</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">reached a definite end in the 1950s and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">actually had started already 4 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">earlier which is the exodus of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">say you travel from one time period into</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">the next one you can actually create</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">a higher state of civilization not that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">our minds get any better we usually get</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">more and more stupid which step we take</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">in history</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">but actually through technology and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">technological advancements</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">we can move from one paradigm to the</p>

<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">and this is why what certification are</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">doing in the very aristotelian sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">with something we call paradigmatics</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">paradigmatics is simply looking around</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">at the world you live in and especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">looking around at the world you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">moving into</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">and then try to define what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">world is that what would it pay off to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">invest in</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">so for example now early 2020s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">would it really pay off to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">politics well</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">does anyone of your friends want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">politician anymore no</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">and america has now resorted to choosing</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">between cartman from south park and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">corona corps for president</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not like they&#39;re making an</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">effort to become politicians anymore</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:52.639" style="s2">so politics has gone ironic academia has</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">gone ironic academia is dead and over</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.639" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">nobody wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">into academia any longer they&#39;re suing</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">the hell out of each other these days</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s gone woke and all those things</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">and obviously all the industry is dying</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">too because all the industry is now</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">being gripped by communication agencies</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:08.000" style="s2">that are trying to politicize even the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">commercial environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.000" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">so they&#39;re all done okay that means</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in investing in them</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">when investing in the future certainly</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">not putting your kids through any of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:18.960" style="s2">those three institutions</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">or have your kids aspire towards any of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">them rather we have to define what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">call in our work and autocracy</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2">like who are going to be the winners in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">the digital realm</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">so we move into a world of digital and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">augmented reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">and the question is who&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">winner in that realm and the funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">is when we started asking these</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">questions 25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">we were pretty alone in actually asking</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">those questions which is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">the ultimate cell phone book is not how</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">to help yourself survive a dying</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">the ultimate self a book should really</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">be uh what would it mean to live in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">future since we know as much about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">future as we actually do</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">so this is what a proper paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">should do today and that&#39;s what we work</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:06:59.599" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">[ __ ] yeah beautiful thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.599" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">awesome introduction</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">andrew as a as a musician and a writer</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">and um and an independent thinker who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">been following</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">similar threads to myself over the last</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">several years interested in john</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">pavaki&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">and jordan peterson and buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">and various things how do you relate to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">this sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">this this picture that alexander&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">laid down</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">well i think um i&#39;m less of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">philosopher than alexander and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">i&#39;m more uh let&#39;s say interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if this is the right word</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">the interior aspect of the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">like um like the mystical aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">exodus</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">right so so um i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a primordial myth and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">think in the judeo</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">christian tradition there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">primordial myths that we&#39;re still living</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">so i think if there&#39;s there&#39;s an exodus</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">for now like there has to there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">dead and dying world that that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">to move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">and there&#39;s another world to go to and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">think alexander&#39;s work is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">mapping out like</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">you know how to do that and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">interested in the spiritual aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">how to do that on you know on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">spiritual level like you know what kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:19.840" style="s2">of human being</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">we need to become right uh in order to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.840" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">let&#39;s say embody this this exodus</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">um yeah and i should add it that in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">work we consider everything to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">so it&#39;s either bad or good religion but</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">you cannot avoid being religious</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">um so yeah spirit spirituality here is</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">just basically any form of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">you know human exercise towards a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">certain goal or or</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">a certain achievement you&#39;re setting out</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we agree</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">i would say that if you do exodus</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.800" style="s2">so you&#39;re doing the studies of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">successful and not so successful</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.800" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">migrations throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">these are both migrations in physical</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">space and migrations in terms of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">okay so if you do exodus properly you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">try to find patterns</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:08.399" style="s2">on what was successful and why it worked</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">and to see if it could work again</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.399" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">or not so you try to learn from these</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly when we go back to things</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">like the exodus out of egypt the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">out of babylon</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">and the exodus from europe to israel the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">three major jewish exodus for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">they&#39;re also exodus of ideas for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">that we originally lived in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">nomadic tribal religion which we call</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">nomidology it&#39;s last trend in today</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:31.120" style="s2">would be say hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">which means it&#39;s a religion of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">eternal return of the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">where no improvement is ever possible</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">hopefully you avoid things getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">but with evantology with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">the sun has access to more information</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">than the father did because it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">masculine trait but like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">say the son has access to more</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">information the father did which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">according to marshall mcluhan the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">revolution of written language</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">once you could write things down which</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">started about say 8</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">000 years ago and then increased over</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">you could store information outside of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">your own brain and we could do that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">sun could then suddenly realize i could</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:09.760" style="s2">actually potentially create a better</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">world than my dad could possibly do</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.760" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">simply because i have access to more</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">information this is the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">and therefore the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">civilization in my case i even converted</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">to the religion that invented this idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">which is zoroastrianism</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">and so rasterism when i did that in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">1980s i did my studies of eastern</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">philosophy i</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">of course i studied all the major hindu</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">and buddhist traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">that&#39;s something with all three an</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">interest to all three share</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">i started taoism and chinese and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:38.240" style="s2">japanese philosophy but when i finally</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">converted i picked the old</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.240" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">persian philosophical tradition because</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">i was even more interested that at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">time and then it turns</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">out that today this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">bridge between east and west because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">only thing that connects eastern</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">religion historically</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">with western metaphysics starting with</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">abrahamic religions and eventually going</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">on to the greeks and european philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">and all that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">the western tradition what is west of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">the gobi desert so to speak it was east</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">of the gobi desert the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">connects the two is actually the persian</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">so guys like me who actually have</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">studied this for the past 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">really important right now to try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">connect chinese indian</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">european middle eastern thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the purpose when i converted</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">i converted because i love the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">zoroaster</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">as hegel anitra points out so raster is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">the only really radical new thinker in</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">in the sense that he was the only one</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">who broke with nominology</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">he broke with the idea that everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">must always return to the same and said</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">no wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">it could potentially be different with</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">each repetition of the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a slight difference and if that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">difference is harvested and nurtured</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:44.560" style="s2">through increased knowledge which is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">name of with</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.560" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">of which the name is technology then</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">with technology we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m totally i&#39;m a civilizationist i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">what has made civilization work in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">and we look at that question what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">interesting then are the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">because what happens is that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:05.519" style="s2">a lot of dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">uh new things happening around you like</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.519" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">right now we&#39;re living in a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">shift where like the entire world has</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">been thrown</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">online due to the corona pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">something we&#39;ve prepared for being</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.360" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">confused about</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">an environment that&#39;s full of children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">diseases like facebook and instagram</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously not working as</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">intended</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">because we&#39;re making all the mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">you do when you apply the rules of an</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">old paradigm onto a new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">you simply have the wrong paradigmatics</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">when we see all this happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">2020 it&#39;s obvious we&#39;ve been thrown into</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">a new world and the new power is going</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">to be online</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">the tech giants have gone through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">roof from the stock markets</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">amazon google facebook and our empires</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">they need to be questioned need them</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">broken up</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">we have to start fighting them because</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">they&#39;re so damn powerful</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">now this was all bound to happen during</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">tournament because we haven&#39;t learned</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">from history that this is what happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">at a paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">then the question is so who would then</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">go first</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">this is why i always tell people that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:04.839" style="s2">i have to be a nietzschem</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">but i expect my students to be more</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.839" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">marxist</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">what i mean with that is that nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">proposes the uberman she proposes</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">somebody who steps forward and goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">ahead</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:18.839" style="s2">and walks into the new territory and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">thereby becomes an example others can</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.839" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">copy and the question then for my</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">students is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">if i work very hard on defining the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:27.920" style="s2">nietzsche and ubermensch in the digital</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">realm today who goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">first who becomes the nettocrat then</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">it&#39;s your damn job to make sure as many</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">people as possible can become netocrats</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">but this is where the hard stuff comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:40.880" style="s2">in we cannot learn from the previous</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:43.639" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.880" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">because the previous paradigm due to its</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.639" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">exploitative approach</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">towards the world towards human beings</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">was built on the naive</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">assumption that we could all have access</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">to all information at all times and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">handle it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">and this is called the barred absolute</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">not my name barb but b-a-r-r-e-d like</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">you you religion you need a bar you need</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">a wall that says you cannot go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">this wall because you&#39;re not prepared</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">for it yet</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">in eastern thinking this is different</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">between sutra and tantra</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">it exists as a raster religion the jews</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">adamant about it but islamic</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">christianity was swept away because</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">these pop religions</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">wanted everybody to have access to god</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">and we inherited that in western society</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">we inherited this tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">oh everything is available to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">at all times</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">and now parents are coming along to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">philosophers like me and said</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">my god my five-year-old is watching</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">well you gotta go back and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">last two thousand years of history</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">you had a religion that tore down the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">curtain in the temple and they said</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">god should be available to everybody at</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">all times meaning that truth should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:54.480" style="s2">available to all people at all times</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">we cannot handle truth unless we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">prepared for it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">and this is why we work so much now with</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">uh with is is is that is the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">elite and the idea of a j of authority</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">right somebody</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">they&#39;re happening now we got peterson</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">from arcadis guy site that warned us at</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">least in america and europe for the last</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">rapid piece we don&#39;t have time to put on</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">gloves and say nice things any longer i</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">go back to the original mythologist</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">exactly like peterson says</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">go back to the store the exodus out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">egypt people</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">the egyptians were warned again and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">finally you had to paint something on</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">your door because the angel death</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">walked by and killed the oldest son in</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">the family</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">because he was so angry with the old</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">society this is all symbolic but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">anger with an old paradigm that is so</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">corrupt and decadent that it just</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">refuses to move its ass</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">the elite here were the hebrews the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">hebrews were clearly as sigmund point</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">pointed out an</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">egyptian sect who knew that they had to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">move into monotheistic paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">they had failed miserably with atonism</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">during it not untitan common that failed</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">and tutankhamun had become their christ</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">it was killed by the priest</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">there was an athens sect in egypt that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">were a minority</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">but they were sharp as hell and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">were smart and they took to the new</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">technology they took to the new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">they understood what was required in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">next phase of history</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">and they declared that it was called</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">atonism and later become judaism</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">so this cult had to leave egypt and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">were also they&#39;re also slaves</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">which is interesting because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">exactly what an elite are the elite</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:23.200" style="s2">is always the slaves of the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">paradigm who studied deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">worked hard and don&#39;t get rewarded for</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">it this is the exact parallel to karl</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:29.919" style="s2">marx</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">proletariat you&#39;ve got to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.919" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">marx is jewish</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.000" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">marx gets this so marx and freud these</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">guys coming out of the hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">revolution in europe</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">they&#39;re really understanding history</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">fully and i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">freud was on to this in his last work</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:45.919" style="s2">before he died moses is monotheism an</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">excellent book to study this deeper</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.919" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">we&#39;re digging deep into to now fully</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">understand the best judaism</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">and heritage we get from the jews right</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">but the hebrews left egypt they were an</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">elite</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">they were the original proletariat who</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">walked</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">out on the old into the new because they</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">make in the old what they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">achieve in the new</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">but then by bringing that faith out</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">into the open more people can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">recruited and join the faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">later in the new promised land and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">can just we can just move that into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">world of ideas and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">instead of discussing which territory</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do this thing because all</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">you need to be digital these days is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">have a city state like</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">in europe estonia slovenia and isil are</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">preparing for this revolution you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">already got dubai and singapore</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t need huge territories like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">united states you don&#39;t need a huge</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">territory like communist china</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">to actually be part of the new</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">revolution because it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">putting a data center somewhere that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">data says more powerful than all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">territory you could ever conquer</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about physical territory</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">this time that&#39;s the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">this is a vertical exodus not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">horizontal one</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a vertical exodus it&#39;s an exodus</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">into the world of ideas into super ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">into depth yeah depth which we call the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">root of the phallus</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.159" style="s2">so that we can be phallic and direct the</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">so the root of the phallus is to learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">from history more than ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">study history deeper than ever use data</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">to get into the the the original known</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">methodology the original society getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">to get into human beings come from</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">gonna ask us in 20 years time</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">who are you and the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">question you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">what does it mean to be human we have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">answer that question again</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">but deeper at this time to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">shoot higher aim higher</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the exodus we&#39;re doing now and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the exodus we&#39;re preparing for</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">so this exodus is an exodus into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">digital realm for sure and the question</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the first of the three</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">metocrys already those are the tech</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">giants we predicted this 25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">first you got the informationalists</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">the guys who pick the data and process</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">the data</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.960" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">second we&#39;re going to have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">sensocrats we&#39;re going to live in police</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure we&#39;re gonna have cameras</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">and microphones that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">observing everything we do whenever</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">somebody tells me these days well i</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">turned off my computer yesterday i</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">walked out of the park and i&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">and you think you went offline have you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">ever heard of satellites</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">have you ever heard of microphones</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">they&#39;re everywhere now so the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">what kind of police states can we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">how can we still be free and liberal</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">within those police states and creative</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">because the problem with dictatorship is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">not a moral one the problem dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">is that it stops being creative</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">so those questions need to be answered</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where we should be now in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">thinking as we move forward</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">and this is why we have to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">the previous access and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">listen telling people that we need a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">elite that it&#39;s already being</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">established</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s just mincemeat here but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">we have a new elite coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">silicon valley and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">billionaires</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">and some of them think better than</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">others peter thiel think better than</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">elbow musk for sure you know but</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">at least they&#39;re doing what they set out</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">to do they&#39;re informationalist</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">then come the sensocrats who will</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">replace the current politicians</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">why would you vote every four years when</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:10.000" style="s2">you vote every second</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">how could you how could you anyway</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.000" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">defend a vote every four years for</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">corona corps</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">or cartman in south park when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">literally vote every second better than</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">you vote every four years</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:23.679" style="s2">okay then after the censorcrafts come</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">possibly and hopefully the protopians</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">protopin great word by kevin kelley he</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">found it he should credit for it</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">but originally the idea for tokens comes</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">from the persons called fraschuk</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">to live in the forever refreshing</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">protopia of ever change</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not a utopian it&#39;s not utopian this</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">token it is an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">state to live in where you create it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">not a final enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a um you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a creative constantly renewing</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">you know yeah it can be a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">absolute but it&#39;s certainly not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">creative absolute in any way whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">proctop is a statement philosophy might</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">reach an end yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">what it means to be human might reach an</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">end yes we might leave it to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">machines to you know conquer outer space</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:12.240" style="s2">so we stay on the planet which we should</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">okay so we might reach an end human</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.240" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">history in a way philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">speaking but</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">certainly not creatively i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">would say that this could be an artistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">golden age more than anything and we</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">call it protopia</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">protopians is what we call these people</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">so now you&#39;ve got the three new elites</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">and you see how the old industry is</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">being replaced by informationalist</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">data replaces capital you see how</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:39.280" style="s2">sensocracy is replacing politics</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s the imaginary power and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a new narrative being</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">dictated by a new symbolic power</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">the the way the academia replaced the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">church is the way that academia will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">replaced by the protopians</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">and this sort of is the beginning what</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">we&#39;re doing kind of right now is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">we&#39;re starting a new narrative</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:59.039" style="s2">like like this is the the shadowy realm</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">where the like i think kegel says that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">where the new narrative starts to bubble</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">tim i think i interrupted you last time</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">in your last question we are literally</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">the hebrews in egypt</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">preparing for the exodus and the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">warning is about to be signed on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">doors yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">well that is some beginning</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">beautiful job that&#39;s how about you tim</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">how about you tim our followers want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:27.039" style="s2">know you better</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">why is the gorgeous young man sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.039" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">the circle and showing off his hairy</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">chest</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">oh yeah um how to integrate that with</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">this last 20 minutes of um</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">of uh philosophical thought and see if</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">we can weave the hairy chest in there</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">towards the end</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">poor man so i</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">so just to describe my my state with</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">there&#39;s so there&#39;s so much vision here</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">that i resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">strongly and then there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">feeling into it which wants to depart</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">from all these different places</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of like um it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">are these different</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">parts that i want to sort of look at and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">go hmm okay how does this connect to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">or my perspective on this is with this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">but then i&#39;m worried about going down</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">one particular route</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">might not necessarily speak to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">does actual justice to the resonance</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">which that i share</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">for the vision and the whole as</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">presented so my first point would</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">actually be</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">sort of a meta point about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">interaction itself and the actual degree</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">of time that&#39;s required</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">to really sit with in a relational</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">these themes these concepts these</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">uh from the grandiosity up actually to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i can use the lateral</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">but at the any rate the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">embodied sort of breathing it through</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m someone who&#39;s interested in both</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">of these things hey i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">of artful interaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:10.559" style="s2">and i&#39;m also interested in a clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:11.919" style="s2">vision and how these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.559" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">interact</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.919" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">so as far as what i&#39;m doing and what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">it&#39;s something like okay how as as one</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.400" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">of the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">how can we get together as an expanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.039" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">an appropriately slowly expanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.039" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">network of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">so as to involve as much of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">human psyche as possible so as to share</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">in the fullness of perception as</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">and use something like a use processes</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">of discernment</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">to together collectively sharing a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">that can attend to what&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:50.159" style="s2">worth caring about</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">as well as it can attend to the clarity</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.159" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">integrity as far as analysis is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">so in this sense an interest in both</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">analysis and mysticism or the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">the inside out</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">feeling of what it is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">relationship as well as the kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">clarity and metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">um integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about so where that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">takes this discussion i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">but that&#39;s how i come at these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">from a broad</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.360" style="s2">sort of life project perspective well</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">that&#39;s great i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">andrew and i especially when we do our</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">our webcast together with thomas hamrick</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">who&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">a you know tantric teacher is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">there&#39;s great vocabulary from the east</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not so common in the west so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">can start using it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:39.679" style="s2">and you can then apply it later on</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">christianity and post christianity in</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.679" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">the west too there&#39;s no problem at all</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">but you&#39;re talking i think on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">individuals i prefer to say the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">individual level</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about meditation and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">and contemplation practices</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">and the great thing is that all the silk</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">group traditions in the east</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">uh were adamant that this was really</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">really important you spent most your</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">when you were being religious actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">meditating or contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">and we know these terms already in india</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s called the diana it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">referred to as yoga practices in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">west this is called the dayena</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">in iran personal practices and daina</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">actually if you look at the word itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">from sagdon to china becomes chan</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">when it comes to china and then becomes</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">tien in vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">becomes zeon in korea it becomes zen</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">in japan so they said this is thread all</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">over the east from zen in japan</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">all the way down to the diana in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">in india and so we have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">traditions a meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">contemplation practices and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">the way it worked along the silk road is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">that you walked into new oasis and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">were a traitor and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">and you you might go to the whorehouse</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">if you were lucky you went certainly to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">a hospice somewhere and had a meal and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">you stayed overnight you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">guest house and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">and you went to the bath house to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">cleaned because you had camel hair and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">dust all over you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">but you most of all went to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">called the kostok</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">and the kostag is the origin we today</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">called monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">the cloisters and the modernities of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">west actually originated in asia</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">and i think kostok is a beautiful sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">of neutral term today</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">for a place where you go to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">contemplate and reflect right i would</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">add</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">you also study because there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">in just sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:23.679" style="s2">trying to find some kind of empty</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">consciousness and then contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.679" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">what am i going to spend the day</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">doing how am i going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">constructive spirit rather destructive</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">spirit today</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what i do in my two xiaomi the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:34.799" style="s2">practices every morning</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:36.320" style="s2">but on the individual level if you start</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">before we start interacting one another</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.320" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">i think it&#39;s really important to stress</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s absolutely pointless in</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">speaking about paradigmatics</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">and speaking about spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">so speaking about how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">enter the digital</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">augmented realm keeping our humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">our spirituality intact</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">unless we go back to and learn these</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">how&#39;s that for a start yeah yeah can i</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">say what i got from what you what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">were saying um</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">the first thing that came to my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">that is that you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">this is it&#39;s a communal enterprise in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">some sort but where where</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">you develop friendship over time and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">that you know that makes the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">uh that that um that&#39;s the creative</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">process right</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:24.640" style="s2">uh which is something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">friendship that was my first thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">um and i also was thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve been exploring recently in in terms</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:32.320" style="s2">of my own practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">and uh normally i&#39;m a vajrayana buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.320" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">but i&#39;ve been looking into jewish</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">esotericism</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">what you do is you look at uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">in this practice that i&#39;m i&#39;m exploring</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">you look at an image</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">right and then you allow the mental you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">associations and you allow the intellect</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">to work on that image and to explore</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">that image you know it might be an</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">alchemical image that has sulfur and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">mercury and the sun and the moon and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:58.720" style="s2">know all these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">primordial things and you you work on</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">that image</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">intellectually and you you you look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">it as if you were looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">you know you know an icon or something</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">like that and you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">you go deep into that and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">intellectual aspect and you do that for</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">20 minutes and the next part</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:14.799" style="s2">is is you try to hold the image in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.799" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">in silence and that becomes a whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">different level of experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">and then the third level you just drop</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">the whole thing and you have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">and you allow it to kind of become a</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">free play a free creative play</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">of a an exploration</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">so you have to go through these these</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">stages where first you look at the image</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">you know and you have the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">stage and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">where it becomes embodied right right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">you know it becomes not theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">right uh and then and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:48.399" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another stage of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">freedom which is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.399" end="00:31:53.279" style="s2">is just pure exploration</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">and here&#39;s here&#39;s one of the good news</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.279" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">philosophically speaking is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">uh after immortal [ __ ] the west broke we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">do a listen</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">when you use the term embodied here</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">andrew that&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">we actually have today a worldview where</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">we are embodied</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">so we assume the body and mind the two</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">aspects of the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">and this is of course the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">tradition of the east</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">but we actually inherited in the west we</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">did that philosophically before</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">even we started like schopenhauer</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">started going to asia and took buddha</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">with him back</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">and you know hegel anita took to roster</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">with them back and all that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">but but actually even before that we had</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">that break i think the break between</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">kant and hegel in western philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">the early 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">is to break with dualism towards modesto</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:38.559" style="s2">and of course binosa</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">was the pioneer of that long before</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.559" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">hegel who also was a modest he was a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">modest as opposed to cartesian dualism</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">but we already left the idea that we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">be human beings and separate</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">uh the body from the mind and in all</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">work i see today all spiritual work i</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">see today</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">this this embodied experience is</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">absolutely central</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">so this is great because actually that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">means that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">a lot of the western tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">would have been very problematic today</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">is no longer problematic</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">it&#39;s already out the window i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">even christianity is trying to find some</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">modest roots today and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">hopefully to go back to the neoplatons</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.039" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">to try to find that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">but but we are already living in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.120" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">accordance with an</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">understanding of that we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">modest universe and that we are modest</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">human beings within that universe</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">so these yeah practices must be embodied</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">absolutely it makes no sense otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">and actually we know from history that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">people who try to separate body and mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">and walk out into the forest so raster</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:36.559" style="s2">warned us about this</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">any guy who walks out into the forest</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.559" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">and thinks his mind is separated from</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:40.960" style="s2">his body</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">we call the pillars afterwards those are</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.960" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">the guys that always cause havoc and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">the people who are not embodied can have</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">the brightest smartest ideas but when</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">you look</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">closer at those ideas they come from</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">people who deny</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">their own bodies to deny their own</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">sexuality for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">and those people are always the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">dangerous i think a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">that&#39;s come out of silicon valley so far</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">has been of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">i call it gnostic dualism right gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">yes silicon valley is about escaping the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">body in some sense into some</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">kind of uh you know machine</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">yeah that uploading thing like if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.560" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">were uploaded into a machine and you no</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">longer had access to your body that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">would be the most</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">horrible thing ever that means the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">thought hasn&#39;t even been thought through</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">the people who you promote uploading</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:28.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">we got to get that navy out the door</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.320" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">quickly so we we&#39;re really attacking an</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">internet that is just full of children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">diseases it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">right now it&#39;s it&#39;s infantile it&#39;s hyper</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">it&#39;s fostering all the worst things in</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">people but it&#39;s not to regulating the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">internet you&#39;re gonna get it right</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">because the people are supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2">regulate the internet</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">who are they well they&#39;re woke people</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re platonist</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">engineers and all kinds of where people</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">don&#39;t make it even worse</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:55.440" style="s2">right now i don&#39;t think we can regulate</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">the internet in any constructive</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.440" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">meaningful way because the people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">are trying to do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">have not done their paradigmatics</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">properly first</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">and in that case it&#39;s better to leave it</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">anarchy and let people learn through</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">their own mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">but rather try to politically or</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">commercially</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">dictate what people should consume and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">see when they go online</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">because that&#39;s gonna that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">even worse than what we have today</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m adamant about right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">better to stay with the anarchy and try</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">to learn as quickly as possible from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">mistakes we&#39;re making so we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">platonists</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">who created cynical platforms like</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">facebook which is all about owning your</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:33.359" style="s2">you know putting advertisement into your</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">like the most sinister thing you could</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">ever do like you you don&#39;t like spam</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">force feed you spam that&#39;s facebook</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">okay we have discovered that on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">massive scale already</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">people are healthily now preferring to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">take a walk in the park rather to stay</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">in those environments</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">but we got to go back and see we can do</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">with the internet but i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">leading by creative example is a much</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">better way than censorship right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">because i&#39;m terrified</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">and politics is like bunch of losers</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">weave these things together because um</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">this the idea that there can be a hard</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">and not energetically destructive of my</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">this interesting phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.760" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">where as far as i can tell their hand</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">should be extended</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">maximally for integris interaction</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">and yet at the same hand on the same on</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">the other hand we are speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">something which is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:04.079" style="s2">a movement away from</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">a kind of previous paradigmatic attitude</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.079" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">which is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">fit to actually be sustainable in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">world as it is currently developing</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">so how is that as a sort of frame is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">that something that&#39;s popping up for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">as like uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">what can we say about this i think we</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">well i&#39;m writing a lot about you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">both andrew and i are involved immense</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:22.560" style="s2">work here in europe we should say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.560" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">but uh we talk about the term</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">adultification</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:31.359" style="s2">so if jordan peterson for example and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">john privacy and i share something in</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.359" end="00:42:34.240" style="s2">common it&#39;s that we want to adult defy</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.240" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">when we were the dultifications that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">adultification was absolutely essential</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">in the original tribal environment</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">at certain ages you were expected to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">certain things otherwise you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">get your reward</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">and the ultimate reward would be right</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">to passage and even after the rite of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">passage you would have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">a period as a young adult before you</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:56.839" style="s2">were actually fully accepted as an adult</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">so the adultification process being</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.839" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">destroyed by the society we lived in</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s been destroyed because we human</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">beings are born with</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">being given absolutely everything and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">that&#39;s sucking the tit</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way it should work okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">the mamilla we call it the miller rather</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">than the tip</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">the mamilla is there as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">important we get out of the matrix which</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">nine months of absolute paradise</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">everything is given to you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">even have to think</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no sense of self in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">in the womb because you have to think</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to solve problems uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">and actually that&#39;s not even the case</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">when you instinctively crawl your way up</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:35.040" style="s2">to the tit and start sucking the tick</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">but the mamilla and the magic of all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">breast milk you get when you suck it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">like it comes from out of nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">okay that is the original fantasy we</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">and that fountain system tore apart and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">our society does not encourage children</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">to love how these things are torn apart</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">for them how these fantasies are</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">destroyed and how the new</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">even tougher even more brutal reality is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">opening up behind each curtain that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">tear down</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">the first one of those is called the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">phallic intrusion it should happen when</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">you&#39;re one year old</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s simply called phallic intrusion</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">because the phallus is what what</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">intrudes into your relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:11.920" style="s2">mamilla and your</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">childhood is then the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.920" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">between the manila that supports you and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">provides for you at all times</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">and you&#39;re playing a grown-up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">what being a child is playing rob</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">while you&#39;re striving towards the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:24.160" style="s2">phallic state which is to be a proper</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">grown-up and you want to be grown up so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.160" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">and a healthy child wants to be grown up</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">so bad and one day you get to that point</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">your biology first kicks in</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">hey your genital organs grow and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">start functioning in a dramatic new way</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">you never thought would happen right</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">and then you are actually prepared</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">through your studies and through your</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">playing as a child to become an adult</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">now we have to understand that this</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">process is broken down</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">so i&#39;m often talking to 25 year olds</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">who who sound like 12 year olds when</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:55.839" style="s2">they talk and the first thing i do is i</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">don&#39;t blame them for them i try to give</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.839" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">them a bigger picture and explain</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">that we have postponed adulthood in our</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:06.319" style="s2">society this again how we</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">youth over wisdom we prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.319" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">childhood over adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">we postponed adulthood pushed it further</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">into our lives</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">later to be encountered later and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">fights and struggles enormously with our</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">biology</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s how we have so many problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.359" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">young girls with eating disorders and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:24.800" style="s2">and and kids come in teenagers come in</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">and they can&#39;t understand how the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.800" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">sexuality actually operates</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">and the obsession with consent culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">which is completely understandable</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:34.319" style="s2">the guys don&#39;t even know when the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">consent happens any longer to the girls</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">because they&#39;re not mature enough to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">understand the signaling</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">so many of the cultural problems have</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">today are simply a problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">of that the adultification process</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen when actually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">obliged to make it happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">we cannot fight our own biology at a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">certain age you need to be this</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">amount of adult to be able to handle</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">life now</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">once you&#39;ve been able to handle adult</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">life you also know that not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">can go to dinner party</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">the host decides she gets to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">dinner party</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">not everybody everybody gets to sleep</p>

<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">actually maybe only one guy gets to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">sleep with her</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">not even him you&#39;ll be turned down</p>

<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">um the question of being an adult what</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.599" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">occurs to me is is you you are in</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">service</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">you know to the world which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">what you&#39;re longing for and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">in the in your question is to be of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">service to the world that&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">do with being an adult</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">in the buddhist tradition they call that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">the bodhisattva or something right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">not about you anymore it&#39;s about</p>

<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">grow out of your adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">self-concerned and</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">and we call it the calligula syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.319" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">because we all think of collegal of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">roman empire as an evil guy because we</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.280" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">were always taught it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">colleague</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:49.680" style="s2">that was really evil he burned our room</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">and killed people all the time but a</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">collegial action was probably a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">healthy young man</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">who grew up with a really nasty uncle</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">tiberius</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">and was brought up by him and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.960" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">basically one day tiberius walked into</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">the room and told caligula</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">you&#39;re now the roman emperor you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:05.599" style="s2">uh the king of the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">you know what everybody hates you wants</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">to kill you what are you gonna do next</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">well you would be paranoid wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">right and the paranoia that caligula</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">must have experienced at that time</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">is precisely the paranoia you get when</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">there is no future</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">so depression means you go back and just</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">rehearse</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">everything you&#39;re going through and as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">man at least women blame it on everybody</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">else and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s called borderline diagnosis men</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">blame it on themselves and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.880" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">male depression and we&#39;re seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">pandemic of this depression right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">depression and bipolarity is everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">young men and i try to teach them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:42.559" style="s2">not your fault</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">this is because we stopped believing in</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.559" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">so because we don&#39;t have an but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">have an exodus myth</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">that that&#39;s the problem right which</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">we don&#39;t have this exodus myth which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:57.359" style="s2">means that you can break out of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">present situation then</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.359" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">there will be something uh there will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">a promised land</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s not about you being part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:07.359" style="s2">cool gang who do the exodus not at all</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">all you need to do young men is tell</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:11.200" style="s2">of the exodus tell them digital will</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">create an</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">endless opportunity for humanity to show</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">themselves creatively in a way we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:16.960" style="s2">never seen before</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">the collaboration between man and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.960" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">machine we have no idea how fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:21.280" style="s2">that could be</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">if we get this right so you can give</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.280" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">them this sort of protopin hope</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we don&#39;t the protopin</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">hope is what you need to give young men</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">for example to get them out of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">depressions</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:32.559" style="s2">and the addictions that come with it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">otherwise you would just treat addiction</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">how you treat that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:37.200" style="s2">you put medication into their systems</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.200" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">but you actually do it just to calm them</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">down and keep them alive to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">about it to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:46.559" style="s2">then foster them to present them with</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">the protopin hope that they can be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.559" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s what great moments have done</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:59.119" style="s2">yeah i mean so i mean it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">pretty clear this is a very trivial</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">but vision the phallic vision</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">the um the absence of masculinity in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">specific sense is something you speak</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">about quite a lot and i think it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s i think it&#39;s critical to</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">discuss i think it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">my sense is that it&#39;s bi-directional</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">this um uh what we</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">what we seek or or what we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">realize in consciousness as the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">to um counteract</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">or or veer off the reciprocally closing</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.319" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">depressive addictive kind of cycle one</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">faced on i mean you&#39;re articulating as</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">something that&#39;s only looking backwards</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">and just recursively going over its own</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">experience and it&#39;s just cut off from</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">the world and other people in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">fundamental sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">my sense is that the um the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">looking backwards i like thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.000" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">terms of the metaphor of an</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">ember and an echo i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">really know how i can technically build</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">that out in a way that&#39;s fitting for</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">this conversation but there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">from my own personal experience as</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">someone who</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">has certainly grappled with depression</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:17.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s pretty easily traceable in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">own life because of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.359" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">my parents divorce and moving from</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:21.119" style="s2">england to australia moving from a</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.119" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">place of connectedness and an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">education to essentially somewhere rural</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">with um with with a school that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">not so great and and all together very</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">different experience i ended up not</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">doing lots of my final exams and</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">you know like went a different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">path um</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">so there was that there was that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">disconnection there but there was</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">something which</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.920" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">um tuning into like</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">there was a basis of care that i had as</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.359" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">a child which not everybody has and i</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">appreciate that but if we even</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">go um psychodynamic or depth</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">psychological and consider the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">the womb state as being that state where</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">there is that potential kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">oceanic boundlessness it&#39;s often spoken</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:08.160" style="s2">about as in stanislav</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">graf of course develops yeah it develops</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.160" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">this work very interestingly in his</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">observations from</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">lsd research in the 50s and 60s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">super super interesting although of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">course even in those cases</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">um if the pregnant mother is not having</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">a great time and it&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">pregnancy you can have complications</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:27.200" style="s2">there and he speaks about unearthing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">kind of experiences of actual</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.200" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">his perinatal matrices or the stages in</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">the birthing process going wrong in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">fundamental sense so</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a horrible sense in</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">which um maybe even not all human beings</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:41.440" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:43.040" style="s2">a kind of an unadulterated sense of</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.440" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">connection that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.040" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">that we can really tune into although</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">i&#39;d say even in that case there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">something there&#39;s work to be done and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">can be realized</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:52.559" style="s2">but there is something beautiful about</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">that about that connection and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.559" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">speaking about modelism</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">now of course we&#39;re speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:59.119" style="s2">process and event i appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">there&#39;s novelty right and uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">following whitehead and what have you</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">but i love that you work this into your</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:05.680" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:06.880" style="s2">but there is this phenomenon that we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.680" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">in fact we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s you know might be equivocational to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">speak in this way we are all connected</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:14.079" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">in some fundamental sense now the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.079" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">mystical element of this that we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">return that we can remember and realize</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:24.000" style="s2">these kind of states of connection</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">this is something distinct in in a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.000" end="00:57:26.640" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">the forward-facing vision but also</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.640" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">deeply informs</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">the dynamics or some of them at least</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.640" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">that we want i think want to see</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">present in a forward-facing vision not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">final utopia</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:38.640" style="s2">but that but that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">worth caring about at all</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.640" end="00:57:42.319" style="s2">because when i hear you know being in</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">relationship with machines and robots</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.319" end="00:57:45.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">it could be cool but why do i care about</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.599" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2">what like what do we care about and i</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s it&#39;s a bi-directional thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:54.480" style="s2">i just wonder what you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">i just want to say well i think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.480" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">alexander starts because he&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">say more than me</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:00.079" style="s2">we were talking about the dark</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">renaissance today uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.079" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">on the chat and so we have the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.640" end="00:58:05.680" style="s2">myth in the front</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">and let&#39;s say the dark renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.680" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">perhaps you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s renaissance rebirthing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">all and all that sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">myth comes so i would say like also that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">the zen</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">arrow goes both ways so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">exodus going this way and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">the renaissance going</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">that way that&#39;s just something to throw</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">in the mix before alexander</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">oh yeah yeah because when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:31.599" style="s2">depression you recycle your own life</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:33.040" style="s2">and it becomes uh an inverted narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">you never asked for the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.040" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">sitting with a depressed guy</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">is that he&#39;s narcissistic and he that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">the last thing he wants to be but he</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:40.559" style="s2">can&#39;t think of anything else but blaming</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">himself in the process</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.559" end="00:58:43.200" style="s2">he&#39;s not going deep enough though</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:43.920" style="s2">because he&#39;s only going to his own</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.200" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.920" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">and when we talk about deepest or the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">root of the phallus it&#39;s the history of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:49.599" style="s2">all mankind</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.079" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">this is a history of at least the last</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.599" end="00:58:52.480" style="s2">200 000 years and hopefully even deeper</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.480" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">and try to understand where do we come</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">from as a human species</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">and where do i fit into that so</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:04.160" style="s2">that that&#39;s what i i would say the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">tragedy we have ahead of us or the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.160" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">problem to saul we have ahead of us is</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:10.319" style="s2">we can definitely define that as long as</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">we are loyal to a clan</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.319" end="00:59:14.960" style="s2">or tribe we can find purpose and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.280" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2">within that clan or that tribe</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.960" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">because we&#39;ve always done that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">historically but what the jews</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:21.200" style="s2">set out to do when they created the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">jewish nation which was the first nation</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.200" end="00:59:24.000" style="s2">in history</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">was that this was actually the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.000" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">out of egypt it was the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">nationalism and nationalism as</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:31.520" style="s2">a religion they should be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">same thing and that&#39;s what jews practice</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.520" end="00:59:33.760" style="s2">and hegel built on he wrote his books in</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">the in</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.760" end="00:59:37.359" style="s2">in the late 19th century he used the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">jewish nation as the perfect example of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.359" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">the perfect national nationhood</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:42.960" style="s2">but nationalism was an attempt at</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">stretching the imagination to at least</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.960" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">those who speak</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">like you or at least share your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s a larger population than just</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">merely clan or tribe</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">and of course before that we have all</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">the major stories this is the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:57.760" style="s2">of religion</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">the major stories that we have two</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">rivers here and they share a river</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:02.000" style="s2">system either they go to war with each</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">other all the time</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.000" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">or we have stories like cain and abel</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">that wonder what&#39;s going to happen if</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:10.720" style="s2">the two river systems don&#39;t see a shared</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">common fate together the shared future</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.720" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:15.520" style="s2">and and that&#39;s where religion</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:18.079" style="s2">essentially is you got the hill up there</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.520" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">we share that hill we come from there</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.079" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">and we go</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">towards that goal which is like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:22.400" style="s2">river banks of the delta that we also</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.400" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">and the rivers are separated in between</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:28.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we build the temple</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:29.760" style="s2">as i build a temple to unify the two</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.319" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">cultures the unification of the two</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.760" end="01:00:33.119" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">this is what civilization has tried to</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.119" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">do so hard for the past 5 000 years</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">and if you can be part of that to give</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">your purpose and meaning in all your</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">life i would say there&#39;s an almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">timeless quality to trying to create the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:49.160" style="s2">narrative to unify people today</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">we call these philosophies</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.160" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">cosmopolitanism</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:54.079" style="s2">that is actually if there is no outside</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:55.839" style="s2">there is no other</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.079" end="01:00:57.440" style="s2">when all human beings are part of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.839" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">same tribe okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.440" end="01:01:00.720" style="s2">that&#39;s hard because usually we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">another tribe</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.720" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">that we&#39;re opposed to and that what</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">gives us identity but it&#39;s a cheap route</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">to identity we use for 5000 years we</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:10.319" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to use it any longer</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to have some kind of a shared</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.319" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">global identity now which</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">fiendish are difficult derrick um you</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:19.280" style="s2">know and a lot of these philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">of the 20th century realized this after</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.280" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">the atomic bomb in 1945 and spent</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">an awful lot of time and energy on</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">trying to re-explore conscient models</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">for that hegelian models for that</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">old mystical spiritual traditions for</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">that to try to see if we could unify</p>

<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:36.799" style="s2">and of course we also have another</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">ambition here which is echotopianism</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.799" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">which is just environmentalism plus</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.839" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">it is to develop the civilization that</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:46.799" style="s2">can handle a sustainable planet</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">which then has access to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.799" end="01:01:52.720" style="s2">technologies that enables that to happen</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">so echotopianism and cosmopolitanism and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.720" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">possibly synthesis are just</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">isms we now invent for people to play</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.280" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.599" end="01:02:02.000" style="s2">playing with these bigger ideas to them</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">pull them down</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.000" end="01:02:05.680" style="s2">put them into your own meditative</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">contemplative practices</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.680" end="01:02:08.799" style="s2">and then start building communities from</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">that the only way you can do it yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.400" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">right when you when you first work in</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">penis&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:21.599" style="s2">yeah but our work like the work of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">ivarka peterson and butterscotch</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.599" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">we all tie into one another greg</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">enriquez is doing this in america right</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:28.079" style="s2">now trying to completely redefine what</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2">psychology is</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.079" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re all working on sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.000" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">systemic thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:34.559" style="s2">jordan hall obviously does this and</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:35.920" style="s2">dennis macenberger do this too so</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.559" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of guys out there trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.920" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">to work on new</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">larger models or systems that we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.680" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:43.839" style="s2">to then but then we have to be activists</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.480" end="01:02:45.440" style="s2">and actually have to implement them and</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.839" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">that starts with their own</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.440" end="01:02:48.960" style="s2">personal spiritual practice it starts</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:51.200" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">and then who else lives nearby to you so</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:55.599" style="s2">you can share the experience</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">one or two mornings every every week and</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.599" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">share meditate to contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the building of a congregation</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">starts there then that congregation can</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">get socially involved in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:06.880" style="s2">neighborhood where you live</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:08.720" style="s2">well to start where you&#39;ve got tons of</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.880" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">psychiatry patients lining up who need</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:13.520" style="s2">more than just psychiatric help right</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:14.960" style="s2">so yes so so that that&#39;s that&#39;s how i</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.520" end="01:03:18.960" style="s2">see it going forward</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:21.039" style="s2">yeah yeah no i it&#39;s here i think though</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.960" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a challenge because um</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.039" end="01:03:25.440" style="s2">my sense at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.160" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">is that the ears that are at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.440" end="01:03:28.880" style="s2">interested to hear what we&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:31.920" style="s2">about are not</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.880" end="01:03:34.000" style="s2">um you&#39;re not likely to find them around</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.920" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">your actual physical location unless you</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.000" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">move somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">where there happen to be clusters</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:42.000" style="s2">already gathering</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">so the people that i connect with most</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.000" end="01:03:45.039" style="s2">around these kind of ideas not that i</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:46.480" style="s2">can&#39;t have conversations with lots of</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.039" end="01:03:48.400" style="s2">people but people that are more</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:51.839" style="s2">committed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">um contemplating these things together</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.839" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">are in fact from all locations in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:57.119" style="s2">world and of course that&#39;s when we are</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">speaking about the kind of um</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.119" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">city in some sense as a digital city</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">now there&#39;s still something to tie back</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">in here and this is something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:06.799" style="s2">jordan hall was speaking about with his</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:08.319" style="s2">civilian project he was on the podcast a</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.799" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">few episodes ago</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing this movement toward or</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:14.160" style="s2">at least an interest in smart</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">villages future thinkers are building</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:18.640" style="s2">one of these it&#39;s definitely within</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.079" end="01:04:20.559" style="s2">this solar system of thinking in terms</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.640" end="01:04:21.680" style="s2">of how can we live together well in an</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.559" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">embodied sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.680" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">but participate in the online commons</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">and market and</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">be innovative because we&#39;re living so</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:29.520" style="s2">well together and taking care of</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.520" end="01:04:32.960" style="s2">practicing things together we can be</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">more generative and you know you can see</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.960" end="01:04:36.079" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.359" end="01:04:36.559" style="s2">those things kind of work my sense is is</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.079" end="01:04:38.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">at least with the voicecraft project</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.720" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">voicecraft collective is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:45.760" style="s2">shared experiences of um of meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.920" end="01:04:47.440" style="s2">dialogue so john viveki&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.760" end="01:04:50.319" style="s2">dialogos of course</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.440" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">um the key thing for me in the years of</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.319" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">this project has always been be part of</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:56.400" style="s2">transformative conversations that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:58.000" style="s2">own personal bias in here of course</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.400" end="01:04:59.920" style="s2">but what we&#39;re experimenting with at</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.000" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">least is how can we in fact come</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.920" end="01:05:03.599" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:06.240" style="s2">and tune into a kind of shared</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.599" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">exploration and integration not just</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.240" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">about these themes but you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:14.319" style="s2">begin to form connections begin to</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">contemplate things like integrity and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.319" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">emergence and whatever it is and um</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:22.319" style="s2">i think this is a key thing like forming</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">connections in a sort of metacultural</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.319" end="01:05:25.760" style="s2">space having access to move between</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:27.599" style="s2">different communities</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.760" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">online where there are protocols</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.599" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">developed for interaction</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:35.520" style="s2">that is like a shared almost you could</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">say ritual i think more like ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.520" end="01:05:41.359" style="s2">where we can know how to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">connect with the people we actually can</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.359" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:45.520" style="s2">benefit from connecting with but still</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:49.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">in some sort of resonant touch with</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.039" end="01:05:53.760" style="s2">a way of integrating these big picture</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:56.559" style="s2">perspectives of where we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.760" end="01:05:58.400" style="s2">with some of the more like real physical</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.559" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">dynamics of our time how can we find the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.400" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">people to do things</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:02.960" style="s2">locally with i think is is an</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2">interesting question and i think the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.960" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:08.880" style="s2">both is important absolutely uh i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">give you an example the center book was</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.880" end="01:06:13.680" style="s2">greatly inspired by burning man</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:15.599" style="s2">and burning man stopped being a major</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.680" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">event for 80 000 californians in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:18.720" style="s2">nevada desert already</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.960" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">30 years ago when he started expanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.720" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">across the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">so larry harvey&#39;s vision for burning man</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:25.440" style="s2">was that this would be way too</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.720" end="01:06:27.920" style="s2">vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.440" end="01:06:29.440" style="s2">it was all about the nevada festival and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.920" end="01:06:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why we basically set up a model</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.440" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">with just 10 simple principles</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:34.880" style="s2">that anybody in the world was allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">copy and as long as they copied and</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.880" end="01:06:38.000" style="s2">reported back to birmingham headquarters</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:39.599" style="s2">they were even given a certificate like</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.000" end="01:06:41.599" style="s2">you&#39;re an official burn</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.599" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">now there are thousands of burns around</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.599" end="01:06:44.720" style="s2">the world and i&#39;ve helped out a lot here</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.440" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">in europe because in europe we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">experimented and</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:49.520" style="s2">invented new formats like urban burn and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:51.520" style="s2">things like that like smaller</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.520" end="01:06:53.680" style="s2">formats were a lower threshold for</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.520" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">people to participate for the first time</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.680" end="01:06:57.920" style="s2">because to me when i came to burning man</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:06:59.680" style="s2">it are all the qualities of a new</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.920" end="01:07:02.880" style="s2">spiritual movement</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.680" end="01:07:03.760" style="s2">i know yeah it is wealthy white</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.880" end="01:07:05.039" style="s2">californians</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.760" end="01:07:07.520" style="s2">go there we don&#39;t even have to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.039" end="01:07:09.520" style="s2">started but again i expect elites who</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.520" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to to start the new ideas</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.520" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">for them the idea is to to you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:14.880" style="s2">spread wider</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">sometimes great ideas come from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.880" end="01:07:17.119" style="s2">bottom up too but sometimes they</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:20.400" style="s2">actually come top</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.119" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">bottom but with burning man it was clear</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.400" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">that you can go at least for eight days</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:25.359" style="s2">and live in a temporary communist utopia</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.319" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">where we ban money</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.359" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">and you you are self-reliant you take</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">care of yourself and here are the simple</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:31.200" style="s2">rules you need to follow for that to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.200" end="01:07:34.720" style="s2">and for example we got an event here in</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:36.079" style="s2">scandinavia called the borderland</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.720" end="01:07:37.599" style="s2">and the borderland this year if it had</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">happened corona stopped it will happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.599" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">next year</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:41.440" style="s2">but 6 000 people gathered without a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:43.200" style="s2">single</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.440" end="01:07:45.280" style="s2">person we professionally employed</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.200" end="01:07:48.079" style="s2">full-time to work on the event</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.280" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">it&#39;s so flat in its structure that six</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.079" end="01:07:50.559" style="s2">thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.119" end="01:07:52.799" style="s2">can manage to live together for eight</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.559" end="01:07:53.359" style="s2">days and create a really fantastic event</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.799" end="01:07:56.160" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.359" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">without nobody getting paid anything</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.160" end="01:07:58.799" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">i love those ideas right now because</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.799" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">again all of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:05.599" style="s2">sort of proto-spiritual ideas we see</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:07.359" style="s2">right now call them spiritual prototypes</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.599" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">the smart villages are certainly</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.359" end="01:08:10.960" style="s2">included that but anything you do</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:14.400" style="s2">anywhere in the world today that</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.960" end="01:08:16.319" style="s2">works will become a story and sooner it</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.400" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">becomes the story the brilliant thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.319" end="01:08:19.120" style="s2">with human beings is that they&#39;re great</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">at mimicking</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.120" end="01:08:22.480" style="s2">they mimic bad stuff when they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:24.159" style="s2">nothing else to mimic they may make</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.480" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">terrible advertising and start smoking</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.159" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">cigarettes if they get nothing better to</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">mimic</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">but when they get great things to mimic</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:30.719" style="s2">that&#39;s what they prefer human beings</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">have a liking</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.719" end="01:08:34.719" style="s2">towards mimic constructive ideas so if</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.719" end="01:08:38.480" style="s2">implements an idea like this and not</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">just talks like we guys are doing right</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:40.239" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:42.640" style="s2">but actually implements an idea like</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.239" end="01:08:44.400" style="s2">this like say builds a digital monastery</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:44.719" style="s2">in france or australia in sweden right</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.400" end="01:08:46.719" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.719" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">that is augmented meaning it also has a</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.719" end="01:08:49.600" style="s2">physical department and a building and a</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:51.679" style="s2">house somewhere where</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.600" end="01:08:53.199" style="s2">people can move and go into deep studies</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.679" end="01:08:53.520" style="s2">and meditation practice and things like</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.199" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.520" end="01:08:56.719" style="s2">like monasteries used to be these</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:08:57.199" style="s2">monasteries are going to come back in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.719" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.199" end="01:09:00.560" style="s2">way because people have such a great</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:03.279" style="s2">need for them and</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.560" end="01:09:04.480" style="s2">every one of them is then an example for</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.279" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">others to look at</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.480" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">and i think the role modeling aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:09.400" style="s2">what important</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:10.560" style="s2">if you move towards some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.400" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">ideological</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.560" end="01:09:14.640" style="s2">hierarchy like okay you have to believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">this and this and this</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">well then we&#39;re going to kill it</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:19.839" style="s2">instantly and if it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">you have to learn how to listen properly</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.839" end="01:09:23.440" style="s2">to others and not use the wrong words</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:24.719" style="s2">but you do have to learn how to listen</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.440" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">properly to others though</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.719" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">you do but if you go into tonality and</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:29.440" style="s2">etiquette before you go into substance</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:31.120" style="s2">you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.440" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what the woke movement is</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.120" end="01:09:33.199" style="s2">done and that&#39;s why it&#39;s failing on a</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.319" end="01:09:34.880" style="s2">massive scale</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.199" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">because at the end of the day substance</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.880" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">such as sustainability of the planet</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:41.040" style="s2">uh does this work do we take</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:42.239" style="s2">responsibility for the budget actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.040" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">things cost money</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.239" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">you know we are surrounded in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">commercial world we&#39;re surrounded by</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">commercial world that we have to have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:50.080" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:51.920" style="s2">towards uh do we make sure that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.080" end="01:09:53.440" style="s2">right people get in through the gate and</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.920" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">actually that there&#39;s a way to throw</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.440" end="01:09:55.600" style="s2">people out that shouldn&#39;t have been her</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.600" end="01:09:59.440" style="s2">or are we just naive and hippie it</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.360" end="01:10:03.360" style="s2">should let everybody in and then fail</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.440" end="01:10:04.960" style="s2">okay so all of these i think i think all</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.360" end="01:10:07.040" style="s2">of these things have to be attended to</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.960" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">and what i said is that yes you have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.040" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">learn how to listen to other people</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:11.440" style="s2">otherwise you go stupid</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.080" end="01:10:14.239" style="s2">actually not only that you have to learn</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:16.880" style="s2">how to people who disagree with you</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.239" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">which we call antagony beautiful word</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.880" end="01:10:20.159" style="s2">because otherwise you end up in an echo</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:22.400" style="s2">chamber and we learn what that is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.159" end="01:10:24.239" style="s2">last 10 years you become stupid</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.400" end="01:10:26.320" style="s2">but we also know that they&#39;re very hard</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.239" end="01:10:27.760" style="s2">to resolve unless there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.320" end="01:10:30.159" style="s2">artfulness in interaction</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.760" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">and capacity to be able to take another</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.159" end="01:10:32.400" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:34.640" style="s2">that can only really come if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.400" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">capacity to regulate oneself and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.640" end="01:10:38.239" style="s2">there&#39;s this dynamic interaction between</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:40.239" style="s2">capacity to listen and capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.239" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">regulate oneself</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.239" end="01:10:44.159" style="s2">so this is where the feminism comes</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:45.600" style="s2">between the feminine and the masculine</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.159" end="01:10:47.040" style="s2">there that you&#39;re exactly no no i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.600" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t even think it&#39;s that i</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.040" end="01:10:49.760" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s feminine or</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.320" end="01:10:51.280" style="s2">that&#39;s just passive or open aggression</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.760" end="01:10:51.840" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about in the case it goes</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.280" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.840" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">no i think this is if you look back at</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">the into the last 30 years and look at</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:10:59.040" style="s2">forums that have existed for 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:10:59.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m a member of a couple of those</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.040" end="01:11:02.400" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.520" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">they were all well moderated they had a</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.400" end="01:11:04.320" style="s2">set of rules you need to follow like</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:06.080" style="s2">burning man</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.320" end="01:11:08.159" style="s2">and they were moderated somebody kept</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.080" end="01:11:10.320" style="s2">check of who walked in who walked out</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.159" end="01:11:11.760" style="s2">and how things were conducted and so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.320" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">got a code of conduct within that</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.760" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:16.080" style="s2">it&#39;s quite easy actually it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">you need it you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:19.600" style="s2">you know say oh we started this thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:21.360" style="s2">and anybody wants to conjoin because</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.600" end="01:11:23.360" style="s2">i totally agree with you facebook forums</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.360" end="01:11:25.120" style="s2">that fail yeah right so we know that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.360" end="01:11:26.239" style="s2">know that we have that experience after</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.120" end="01:11:28.000" style="s2">30 years again</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.239" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">role modeling look at anybody who</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.000" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">successfully moderated the forum for 30</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:33.440" style="s2">years and learn from them</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:35.040" style="s2">well yeah so a forum obviously is true</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.440" end="01:11:37.199" style="s2">that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.040" end="01:11:38.480" style="s2">a solipsistic aspect to this like</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.199" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">circling thing where</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:41.520" style="s2">people get together and they circle</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:42.480" style="s2">around their emotions over and over and</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.520" end="01:11:45.840" style="s2">over again</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.480" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">um and and there&#39;s no real content there</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.840" end="01:11:48.560" style="s2">often it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:51.440" style="s2">and people think have all these</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.560" end="01:11:53.040" style="s2">emotional openings and experiences and</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.440" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">then after after that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.040" end="01:11:56.159" style="s2">you know what have we what have we</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">really learned here</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.159" end="01:12:00.560" style="s2">um so there i don&#39;t know there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">i think uh there has to be some logos to</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.560" end="01:12:04.000" style="s2">if that&#39;s the correct word in into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">mix</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.000" end="01:12:08.000" style="s2">i agree it&#39;s it&#39;s a dynamic interaction</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:11.360" style="s2">i mean so um</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.000" end="01:12:13.199" style="s2">yeah like okay so so let me let me</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.360" end="01:12:14.480" style="s2">put a few perspectives on the table then</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.199" end="01:12:16.719" style="s2">i&#39;m really interested to see how you</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.480" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">guys connect these ideas um</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.719" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">so okay so the first one something that</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:22.320" style="s2">you discuss in your book as well</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:24.800" style="s2">alexander in</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.320" end="01:12:25.840" style="s2">referencing ian mcgillcrist although you</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.800" end="01:12:28.560" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.840" end="01:12:30.800" style="s2">reference him to sort of support that uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.560" end="01:12:32.640" style="s2">exactly the medical research</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.800" end="01:12:33.920" style="s2">shows that the left hemisphere is for</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.640" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">this and the right hemispheres but this</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.920" end="01:12:38.080" style="s2">but as metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:38.640" style="s2">um so it&#39;s kind of interesting i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.080" end="01:12:40.159" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.640" end="01:12:41.679" style="s2">really terrible quality master&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.159" end="01:12:43.600" style="s2">dissertation i called it part making</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.679" end="01:12:46.880" style="s2">hole making and process</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.600" end="01:12:47.280" style="s2">um and for me i did i i wrote i wrote it</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.880" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.280" end="01:12:51.280" style="s2">be so depressively degrading you wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">great thesis no no it was [ __ ] i&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.280" end="01:12:55.679" style="s2">you why it was [ __ ] because</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:57.199" style="s2">so i went to uh university of bristol</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.679" end="01:12:57.679" style="s2">for the masters which is a philosophy of</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.199" end="01:12:59.360" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.679" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">one of the top philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.360" end="01:13:02.640" style="s2">universities and that wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:04.159" style="s2">my choice i made it for personal reasons</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.640" end="01:13:05.679" style="s2">at the time it was just</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.159" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">economically viable it&#39;s where my</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.679" end="01:13:10.159" style="s2">girlfriend at the time was going and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:12.000" style="s2">it was you know whatever so but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.159" end="01:13:13.840" style="s2">not my temperament as a philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.000" end="01:13:16.960" style="s2">though i&#39;m interested in analytic</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.840" end="01:13:20.000" style="s2">clarity and i do my best i&#39;m more of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:21.920" style="s2">continental kind of persuasion but even</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.000" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">putting that aside i&#39;m interested in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.920" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">kind of more um</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:26.719" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in philosophy as life and</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.719" end="01:13:31.840" style="s2">not only right i was interested in</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:33.679" style="s2">phenomenology but i was very interested</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.840" end="01:13:35.520" style="s2">in psychedelics i was very interested in</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.679" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">psychedelics and the recognition that</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.520" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">the patterns that were important to</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">discuss were things that were to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:44.000" style="s2">essentially enacted in the world and now</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:46.400" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t cram them not only that but i</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.000" end="01:13:49.760" style="s2">couldn&#39;t cram them into the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.400" end="01:13:51.040" style="s2">formulaic way that so i failed essays</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.760" end="01:13:52.640" style="s2">because i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.040" end="01:13:54.880" style="s2">wasn&#39;t presenting them in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.640" end="01:13:56.960" style="s2">people wanted to see essays presented so</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.880" end="01:13:58.560" style="s2">as a compromise i had to present things</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.960" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">in a way which took away a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.560" end="01:14:01.520" style="s2">creative enjoyment for me and so it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:03.520" style="s2">that basis that</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.520" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">i say it was a [ __ ] [ __ ] essay and also</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.520" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">because well</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">for other things too but anyway part</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:11.120" style="s2">making homemaking and process</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">the idea broadly speaking of we have</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.120" end="01:14:15.440" style="s2">this analytical</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:17.360" style="s2">style so bertrand russell spoke about</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.440" end="01:14:18.080" style="s2">the mystical impulse and the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.360" end="01:14:19.840" style="s2">impulse</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.080" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s something like this it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.840" end="01:14:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s interested in um</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">seeing things and how they fit together</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.600" end="01:14:27.760" style="s2">once you&#39;ve already taken</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:29.280" style="s2">a gestalt and want to sort of dissect it</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.760" end="01:14:30.640" style="s2">to see if there&#39;s consistency</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.280" end="01:14:32.560" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.640" end="01:14:34.719" style="s2">actually integrate and open up and to</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.560" end="01:14:38.000" style="s2">have a different kind of of vision</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.719" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">um to feel one&#39;s connectedness to things</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.000" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">and to sort of intuit</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:45.440" style="s2">patterns and how things fit together and</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:47.040" style="s2">i think as cognitive styles we can tend</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.440" end="01:14:49.360" style="s2">towards one or the other</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.040" end="01:14:50.880" style="s2">and alexander you speak about philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.360" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">as being something which toes the line</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.880" end="01:14:54.320" style="s2">between both of these and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.239" end="01:14:57.280" style="s2">smaller percentage of the population</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.320" end="01:14:58.159" style="s2">and so you know broadly speaking and</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.280" end="01:15:00.000" style="s2">this is not</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.159" end="01:15:01.360" style="s2">exactly precise language but i kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.000" end="01:15:02.719" style="s2">like it i think about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.360" end="01:15:04.719" style="s2">thinking and feeling</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.719" end="01:15:06.000" style="s2">now it&#39;s not just thinking of me i&#39;m b</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.719" end="01:15:08.800" style="s2">you have to be you have to be charitable</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.000" end="01:15:11.679" style="s2">with me um with these terms</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.800" end="01:15:13.520" style="s2">now vocabulary used and provoked for</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.679" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">varkivit is that i basically said that</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.520" end="01:15:16.400" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about narratives</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.040" end="01:15:17.280" style="s2">there are fundamentally three different</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:19.199" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:20.480" style="s2">and our hemispheres make two of them one</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.199" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">is called logos the other is called</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.480" end="01:15:23.360" style="s2">pathos</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:25.600" style="s2">and logos is your thinking and pathos is</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.360" end="01:15:27.360" style="s2">your feeling and the mythos</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.600" end="01:15:29.440" style="s2">the story we tell about ourselves is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.360" end="01:15:29.840" style="s2">attempt to unify the two that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.440" end="01:15:31.920" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.840" end="01:15:33.520" style="s2">is tied to the sense of self so i use</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.920" end="01:15:35.040" style="s2">logos paths and myths in a very</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.520" end="01:15:35.520" style="s2">simplified way actually to describe</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.040" end="01:15:38.320" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.520" end="01:15:38.880" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re talking about okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.320" end="01:15:40.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.880" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">so broadly we have these different</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.480" end="01:15:43.760" style="s2">cognitive styles some people might tend</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:45.760" style="s2">towards one more than the other</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.760" end="01:15:47.440" style="s2">and maybe society even preferences them</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.760" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">for various reasons i mean you could</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.440" end="01:15:50.080" style="s2">might look at autism and various things</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:51.199" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.080" end="01:15:53.040" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.199" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">the kind of engineering impulse in one</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.040" end="01:15:55.520" style="s2">way or the artistic impulse in that</p>

<p begin="01:15:55.520" end="01:15:59.600" style="s2">can kind of grasp onto these things with</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.080" end="01:16:02.239" style="s2">the question is okay</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.000" end="01:16:11.040" style="s2">ways that we can tend as archetypal</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:23.120" style="s2">and expressive capacity whether</p>

<p begin="01:16:50.560" end="01:16:53.760" style="s2">to um speak to</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.159" end="01:16:55.520" style="s2">the fullness of why you&#39;re serious about</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.760" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">that but one of the reasons is that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.520" end="01:16:59.199" style="s2">recognize the importance that the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:01.679" style="s2">over man of the future</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.199" end="01:17:03.199" style="s2">so to so to say is not a man it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.679" end="01:17:04.080" style="s2">one person certainly not a man but</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.199" end="01:17:07.360" style="s2">actually a</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.080" end="01:17:09.120" style="s2">a group of people a collective that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.360" end="01:17:10.800" style="s2">recognizes nevertheless the</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.120" end="01:17:12.080" style="s2">identification there&#39;s individual</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.800" end="01:17:15.040" style="s2">sovereignty but they but</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.080" end="01:17:16.080" style="s2">the individual kind of dynamics of inner</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.040" end="01:17:18.239" style="s2">development but also</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.080" end="01:17:19.199" style="s2">the inter relationship so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.239" end="01:17:21.520" style="s2">relational</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.199" end="01:17:23.520" style="s2">philosophy again and so it&#39;s okay my</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:26.719" style="s2">proposition would be then it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:30.560" style="s2">it&#39;s actually understanding the and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.719" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">in innovating in this new medium</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.560" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">um sourcing what our archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:36.800" style="s2">dispositions</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:38.080" style="s2">are through the course of evolution and</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.800" end="01:17:39.040" style="s2">understanding how they&#39;re playing in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.080" end="01:17:41.280" style="s2">new medium</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.040" end="01:17:42.480" style="s2">but what&#39;s the right relationship of</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.280" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.480" end="01:17:45.920" style="s2">as a people talk about collective</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.000" end="01:17:47.440" style="s2">intelligence but here</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.920" end="01:17:48.800" style="s2">i think intelligence depends what i mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.440" end="01:17:49.960" style="s2">by intelligence but let&#39;s just go with</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.800" end="01:17:52.560" style="s2">it what the right</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.960" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">interrelationship of these component</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.560" end="01:17:57.600" style="s2">parts or individuals are so as to</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:17:58.000" style="s2">be maximally innovative and actually do</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.600" end="01:18:01.199" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.000" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">thing of enacting the realization of</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.199" end="01:18:04.960" style="s2">this shared mythos</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">which then becomes the thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.960" end="01:18:09.600" style="s2">mimicked and in this way</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:13.360" style="s2">i see a capacity for um</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.600" end="01:18:14.960" style="s2">spreading on a much wider scale um</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.360" end="01:18:16.719" style="s2">anyway so that&#39;s that&#39;s as an initial</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.960" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">proposition something like this</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.719" end="01:18:20.880" style="s2">oh yeah i get it i get it uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.880" end="01:18:22.560" style="s2">talking about um</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.880" end="01:18:24.840" style="s2">an intelligent group of people that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.560" end="01:18:28.000" style="s2">love to belong to</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.840" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">yeah we call it the gangs it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.000" end="01:18:31.280" style="s2">learning how to behave together with</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:32.640" style="s2">four other guys your own age</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.280" end="01:18:34.640" style="s2">and then you got the men&#39;s group and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.640" end="01:18:36.000" style="s2">man scoped by men of different ages who</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.640" end="01:18:37.679" style="s2">call each other out</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.000" end="01:18:39.040" style="s2">but you have the different formats you</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.679" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">can work with and</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.040" end="01:18:43.920" style="s2">uh i would say um two things the first</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">thing is that you need to find your own</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.920" end="01:18:46.640" style="s2">archetype</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:48.320" style="s2">and your own archetype usually has two</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.640" end="01:18:50.320" style="s2">levels that&#39;s why we have majors and</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.320" end="01:18:53.280" style="s2">minors when we go to college so</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.320" end="01:18:54.719" style="s2">uh your first primary archetype is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.280" end="01:18:56.800" style="s2">thing you do with ease</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.719" end="01:18:58.960" style="s2">without even paying attention to it but</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.800" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2">other people admiring you</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.960" end="01:19:02.239" style="s2">and people often mistake this they often</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:04.159" style="s2">think that they have to work hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.239" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">to get to their archetype i said no your</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.159" end="01:19:07.360" style="s2">primary archetype is probably something</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:08.719" style="s2">you just have lost for naturally</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.360" end="01:19:10.880" style="s2">it&#39;s just something you&#39;re good at it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.719" end="01:19:11.920" style="s2">like you know cooking walking the dog or</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.880" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">whatever it doesn&#39;t have to be that</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.920" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">advanced but something that other people</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:17.280" style="s2">see you doing and say wow he&#39;s on fire</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:19.920" style="s2">and he does that and does it really well</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.280" end="01:19:22.239" style="s2">so the primary archetype is don&#39;t go too</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.920" end="01:19:23.600" style="s2">far to find it find it very closely to</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.239" end="01:19:24.960" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.600" end="01:19:26.719" style="s2">sometimes you inherit it from your</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.960" end="01:19:27.760" style="s2">father your mother sometimes you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.719" end="01:19:29.679" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.760" end="01:19:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s an archetype and if it&#39;s not from</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.679" end="01:19:32.560" style="s2">one of your parents go find a mentor of</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.679" end="01:19:34.719" style="s2">asset</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.560" end="01:19:36.400" style="s2">find an older person preferably your own</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.719" end="01:19:38.560" style="s2">gender not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.400" end="01:19:40.400" style="s2">who has that archetype and has developed</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.560" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">it fully who can then teach you</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.400" end="01:19:43.520" style="s2">how you develop it then you got a</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:44.640" style="s2">secondary archetype too which</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.520" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">we should point out the secondary</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.640" end="01:19:47.040" style="s2">archetype is this is something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:49.600" style="s2">good at if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.040" end="01:19:51.280" style="s2">if somebody has to be so say somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.600" end="01:19:53.199" style="s2">looking for somebody with a specific</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.280" end="01:19:55.360" style="s2">primary archetype and nobody shows up</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.199" end="01:19:57.360" style="s2">then you say okay i&#39;m not an expert at</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.360" end="01:19:58.880" style="s2">it but i worked on it and i got certain</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.360" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">talents for it so i can take on that</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.880" end="01:20:02.480" style="s2">responsibility temporarily</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.880" end="01:20:04.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s when you get challenged to</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.480" end="01:20:05.280" style="s2">really grow when you go into a secondary</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.400" end="01:20:07.440" style="s2">architect</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.280" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">developing these two archetypes before</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.440" end="01:20:12.719" style="s2">you&#39;re 25 years old and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:14.480" style="s2">lucky that&#39;s a really good start in life</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.719" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what education should give you</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.480" end="01:20:17.199" style="s2">that is what your surroundings your</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:18.880" style="s2">family should give you that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.199" end="01:20:19.679" style="s2">certainly what your best friends and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.880" end="01:20:21.360" style="s2">your social</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.679" end="01:20:23.440" style="s2">media should give you before you&#39;re 25</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.360" end="01:20:25.199" style="s2">years old if you have those</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.440" end="01:20:27.440" style="s2">then you next discover that your</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.199" end="01:20:30.159" style="s2">archetype because you&#39;re younger your</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.440" end="01:20:32.239" style="s2">archetype is the archetype of energy</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.159" end="01:20:33.920" style="s2">younger not a wisdom yet because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.239" end="01:20:35.920" style="s2">archetype of wisdom is the one you get</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.920" end="01:20:36.800" style="s2">when you&#39;ve done it for years you do it</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.920" end="01:20:38.000" style="s2">one hand and</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.800" end="01:20:39.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the easiest thing in the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.000" end="01:20:40.960" style="s2">because i&#39;ve done it so many times</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.120" end="01:20:42.159" style="s2">before and you can actually become a</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.960" end="01:20:43.520" style="s2">teacher of it</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.159" end="01:20:44.800" style="s2">you can become a role model of it</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.520" end="01:20:45.360" style="s2">because you can be that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.800" end="01:20:46.800" style="s2">older</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.360" end="01:20:49.120" style="s2">and you have the wisdom of that</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.800" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">archetype when you&#39;re younger</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.120" end="01:20:53.600" style="s2">you you have no idea how fun it is to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:55.120" style="s2">a mentor it&#39;s wonderful to be older and</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.600" end="01:20:56.400" style="s2">to be a teacher and to be good at</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.120" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">something at least and</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.400" end="01:21:00.080" style="s2">and be able to teach it and pass it on</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:02.320" style="s2">to somebody younger and see how they try</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.080" end="01:21:04.320" style="s2">to do it and put tons of energy into it</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.320" end="01:21:06.480" style="s2">and they do it more energetically and</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.320" end="01:21:08.719" style="s2">even more creatively</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.480" end="01:21:10.639" style="s2">than you do as the wise man because</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.719" end="01:21:12.239" style="s2">because they are having to do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.639" end="01:21:13.199" style="s2">novel way they just don&#39;t do it the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.239" end="01:21:15.120" style="s2">way all over</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.199" end="01:21:16.960" style="s2">this is the love between generations i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.120" end="01:21:19.520" style="s2">looking for a spiritual work</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.960" end="01:21:21.760" style="s2">now if you then put that into the group</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.520" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">context it could certainly work what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.760" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">important here</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:26.560" style="s2">is to not go into a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:28.639" style="s2">where people are just sort of lazy and</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.560" end="01:21:31.600" style="s2">almost an infinite way join the group</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.639" end="01:21:32.560" style="s2">to avoid hard work spirituality is</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.600" end="01:21:34.400" style="s2">always hard work</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.560" end="01:21:35.679" style="s2">otherwise it isn&#39;t spirituality so</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.400" end="01:21:37.120" style="s2">somebody says that oh we&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.679" end="01:21:38.960" style="s2">to get some people together and</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.120" end="01:21:40.239" style="s2">you&#39;re going to sit here in circle and</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.960" end="01:21:41.440" style="s2">here&#39;s a little crystal or something you</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.239" end="01:21:43.040" style="s2">can hold your hand and pass on to the</p>

<p begin="01:22:25.600" end="01:22:30.639" style="s2">number one is intention number two is</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.040" end="01:22:33.600" style="s2">the ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.639" end="01:22:35.760" style="s2">and number three is the integration and</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.600" end="01:22:38.800" style="s2">this goes for group exercises too</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.760" end="01:22:39.040" style="s2">even more so that&#39;s why i tell people if</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.800" end="01:22:41.040" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.040" end="01:22:42.480" style="s2">if people call you and want you to join</p>

<p begin="01:22:44.000" end="01:22:47.360" style="s2">intention is</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.120" end="01:22:49.040" style="s2">and then go to yourself and be tough on</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:50.080" style="s2">yourself and look at your own intentions</p>

<p begin="01:23:34.719" end="01:23:37.520" style="s2">integrate</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.280" end="01:23:38.560" style="s2">so the next intention you take on with</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.520" end="01:23:42.000" style="s2">the same group</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.560" end="01:23:43.600" style="s2">is on a higher level now if you do that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.000" end="01:23:44.239" style="s2">if you think in tension ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.600" end="01:23:46.960" style="s2">integration</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.239" end="01:23:48.719" style="s2">then i&#39;m all for group collaborations</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.960" end="01:23:50.480" style="s2">then i always ask myself these days not</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.719" end="01:23:51.199" style="s2">to waste time my time with anybody this</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.480" end="01:23:52.960" style="s2">time is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.199" end="01:23:54.960" style="s2">what is the intention here and i said</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.960" end="01:23:56.000" style="s2">okay if i should have read a certain</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.960" end="01:23:58.000" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.000" end="01:23:59.040" style="s2">or seen a certain film or studied</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.000" end="01:24:01.199" style="s2">something before</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.040" end="01:24:03.120" style="s2">this group gets together then i should</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.199" end="01:24:04.480" style="s2">really do that i take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.120" end="01:24:06.239" style="s2">that part of my intention is my</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.480" end="01:24:07.440" style="s2">preparation for this work</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.239" end="01:24:09.040" style="s2">because i&#39;m not going to sit there and</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.440" end="01:24:10.159" style="s2">pretend just by reading the wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.040" end="01:24:12.000" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.159" end="01:24:13.360" style="s2">and dropping a few names that understand</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.000" end="01:24:14.239" style="s2">what you guys are talking about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.360" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">just that just</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.239" end="01:24:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s just being deeply unserious about</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:19.840" style="s2">spiritual work and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.440" end="01:24:20.800" style="s2">i think if people can get both the</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.840" end="01:24:22.080" style="s2">archetype for</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.800" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">on their own level right and then look</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.080" end="01:24:25.920" style="s2">at the mixing of archetypes which</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:29.199" style="s2">which is a great group great group it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.920" end="01:24:32.320" style="s2">a mixing arc a congregation is the full</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.199" end="01:24:34.159" style="s2">full schema of archetypes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.320" end="01:24:36.080" style="s2">like a congregation religious</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.159" end="01:24:39.040" style="s2">congregation is the imitation of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.080" end="01:24:41.600" style="s2">tribe in its full glory</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.040" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">now if if we do that serious work then</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.600" end="01:24:45.280" style="s2">i&#39;m all for it yes i</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:46.719" style="s2">i subscribe to all of these ideas but i</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.280" end="01:24:49.199" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important to get</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.719" end="01:24:50.960" style="s2">the grounding proper first properly</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.199" end="01:24:52.719" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:54.880" style="s2">yeah i appreciate that thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.719" end="01:24:56.320" style="s2">outlining that i um</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.880" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">i think it&#39;s really you know because</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.320" end="01:25:00.000" style="s2">taking psychedelics is the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:01.199" style="s2">you don&#39;t throw psychedelics into the</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.000" end="01:25:03.040" style="s2">throat of a complete</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.199" end="01:25:05.360" style="s2">unknown who&#39;s not prepared for it</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.040" end="01:25:06.960" style="s2">absolutely preparation is everything</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.360" end="01:25:08.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t it a preparation is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.960" end="01:25:10.719" style="s2">intentional part right you have to do a</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.880" end="01:25:11.120" style="s2">lot of preparation for stuff i think you</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.719" end="01:25:14.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.120" end="01:25:14.639" style="s2">preliminary preparation all right i take</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.320" end="01:25:16.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.639" end="01:25:17.920" style="s2">i take this very seriously but just to</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.960" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.920" end="01:25:20.560" style="s2">recall something we said at the</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:21.679" style="s2">beginning of this conversation something</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.560" end="01:25:24.960" style="s2">you outlined in your</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.679" end="01:25:28.320" style="s2">early um introduction alexander</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.960" end="01:25:29.760" style="s2">was that well we are in the midst of a</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.320" end="01:25:32.719" style="s2">paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.760" end="01:25:33.760" style="s2">and there is much of the wisdom that got</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.719" end="01:25:36.320" style="s2">us here</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.760" end="01:25:37.920" style="s2">which must be recalibrated and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.320" end="01:25:39.520" style="s2">taken forward and we can still be</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.920" end="01:25:41.280" style="s2">informed by deep history i&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.520" end="01:25:41.679" style="s2">with you i think it&#39;s deeply important</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.280" end="01:25:43.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.679" end="01:25:45.199" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the reasons i love love your</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.520" end="01:25:46.239" style="s2">work and appreciate the podcast and all</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.199" end="01:25:47.840" style="s2">the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.239" end="01:25:49.679" style="s2">and at the same time there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.840" end="01:25:50.880" style="s2">sense in which we&#39;re stepping into novel</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.679" end="01:25:53.280" style="s2">terrain</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.880" end="01:25:55.520" style="s2">my sense is the organization the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.280" end="01:25:57.440" style="s2">emergent organization of what archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.520" end="01:25:59.840" style="s2">are in fact necessary and what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.440" end="01:26:01.199" style="s2">in us to be able to interact in these</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.840" end="01:26:04.239" style="s2">new mediums</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.199" end="01:26:05.760" style="s2">is itself there&#39;s something different</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.239" end="01:26:09.199" style="s2">there or at least there could be</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.760" end="01:26:12.400" style="s2">and if that&#39;s the case what then</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.199" end="01:26:13.280" style="s2">for basically uh the experimentation as</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.400" end="01:26:15.199" style="s2">far as it goes</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.280" end="01:26:16.719" style="s2">is a work in progress let&#39;s put it like</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.199" end="01:26:21.040" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.719" end="01:26:23.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of like yes um</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.040" end="01:26:24.560" style="s2">intention ceremony integration</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.520" end="01:26:27.040" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.560" end="01:26:28.880" style="s2">am i sure of what the most important</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.040" end="01:26:30.560" style="s2">intentions are what all the archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.880" end="01:26:30.960" style="s2">are what the ceremony precisely needs to</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.560" end="01:26:32.719" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.960" end="01:26:35.520" style="s2">and also what the integration practices</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.719" end="01:26:36.719" style="s2">are no i&#39;m not sure about those things</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.520" end="01:26:38.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.719" end="01:26:40.239" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s some stuff there and</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.880" end="01:26:44.800" style="s2">i think this is where</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.239" end="01:26:44.800" style="s2">the innovation needs to occur</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.199" end="01:26:50.320" style="s2">sure yeah because i think i&#39;ll say okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.320" end="01:26:51.840" style="s2">go ahead i just said i thought that</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.320" end="01:26:53.199" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of problem with</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.840" end="01:26:54.719" style="s2">these sort of things when you get very</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.199" end="01:26:57.120" style="s2">very ambitious and you try to</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.719" end="01:26:58.239" style="s2">create some grandiose thing where where</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.120" end="01:26:59.760" style="s2">the the people who</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.239" end="01:27:01.440" style="s2">started birding man probably just a</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.760" end="01:27:03.760" style="s2">couple guys like you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.440" end="01:27:05.360" style="s2">like this thing that jesus says if two</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.760" end="01:27:07.440" style="s2">or three people are gathered</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.360" end="01:27:08.960" style="s2">in my name that&#39;s all you you really you</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.440" end="01:27:12.000" style="s2">really need</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.960" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">on some level but yeah right i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.000" end="01:27:16.239" style="s2">to create this super structure</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.520" end="01:27:17.760" style="s2">uh and be incredibly ambitious this</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.239" end="01:27:19.760" style="s2">purely in the vision space this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.760" end="01:27:22.960" style="s2">purely and what&#39;s conceptually possible</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.760" end="01:27:25.199" style="s2">by by way and integrating that with</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.960" end="01:27:27.040" style="s2">this uh dynamic that we&#39;ve got going on</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.199" end="01:27:28.960" style="s2">here which has the exodus on the one</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.040" end="01:27:29.600" style="s2">hand and just how big is the separation</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.960" end="01:27:32.639" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.600" end="01:27:35.120" style="s2">like my intentions are not</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.639" end="01:27:37.120" style="s2">any more grandiose than is appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.120" end="01:27:39.679" style="s2">to to have them and</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.120" end="01:27:41.520" style="s2">that really is nested in the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.679" end="01:27:44.159" style="s2">there&#39;s not a person</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.520" end="01:27:44.639" style="s2">well there are people i meet who who i</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.159" end="01:27:47.840" style="s2">am</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.639" end="01:27:51.280" style="s2">wary that i cannot extend a hand of</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.840" end="01:27:55.920" style="s2">interaction to in a way that&#39;s um not</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.280" end="01:27:58.960" style="s2">you know aware of the fact it may not be</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.920" end="01:28:02.320" style="s2">taken well or something like this but</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.960" end="01:28:04.320" style="s2">for the most part you know i</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.320" end="01:28:06.400" style="s2">a gathering of intelligent people</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.320" end="01:28:10.000" style="s2">beautiful but but i also</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.400" end="01:28:13.280" style="s2">i i know that there is a capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.000" end="01:28:14.000" style="s2">remember what to care about and to hold</p>

<p begin="01:28:28.880" end="01:28:31.520" style="s2">with integrity</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.920" end="01:28:33.440" style="s2">this speaks to the kind of matriarchal</p>

<p begin="01:28:35.199" end="01:28:38.880" style="s2">but broadly speaking this like you know</p>

<p begin="01:28:38.880" end="01:28:42.960" style="s2">you know beautiful things are possible</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.040" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">when speaking with someone who is</p>

<p begin="01:29:01.199" end="01:29:05.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like man we are obviously we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.920" end="01:29:07.600" style="s2">creatures with a lineage of billions of</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.679" end="01:29:09.760" style="s2">[ __ ] years the patent recognition and</p>

<p begin="01:29:11.760" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">in my opinion there is</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.960" end="01:29:16.159" style="s2">if there is the capacity to listen</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.880" end="01:29:18.960" style="s2">deeply and well</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.159" end="01:29:20.080" style="s2">and to make one&#39;s presence felt in a</p>

<p begin="01:29:20.080" end="01:29:24.000" style="s2">then then then there&#39;s something to add</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.960" end="01:29:26.480" style="s2">to that collective</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.000" end="01:29:26.480" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.280" end="01:29:31.760" style="s2">yeah some of this is rhetoric and</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.000" end="01:29:33.520" style="s2">rhetoric is a fantastic science in</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.760" end="01:29:35.120" style="s2">itself i mean how do you speak properly</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.520" end="01:29:36.639" style="s2">to other people how do you behave in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.120" end="01:29:38.800" style="s2">certain environment how do you find out</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.639" end="01:29:40.159" style="s2">the context before you enter the room</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.800" end="01:29:42.159" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly no cue i called</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.159" end="01:29:42.960" style="s2">preparation of invitation making</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.159" end="01:29:45.920" style="s2">actually yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.960" end="01:29:47.199" style="s2">no i and and we live in a very heated</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.920" end="01:29:49.679" style="s2">environment at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.199" end="01:29:50.800" style="s2">but on the other hand i&#39;m one of those</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.679" end="01:29:52.400" style="s2">who who you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.800" end="01:29:54.080" style="s2">i can behave in a very hot way on</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.400" end="01:29:54.560" style="s2">twitter because i think the medium</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.080" end="01:29:56.639" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.560" end="01:29:58.080" style="s2">is that medium okay but i certainly</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.639" end="01:29:59.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t behave the same way if i go to</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.080" end="01:30:02.400" style="s2">her dinner party</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.280" end="01:30:03.840" style="s2">so uh i i think i&#39;m trying to experiment</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.400" end="01:30:05.600" style="s2">just like everybody else&#39;s and i take</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.840" end="01:30:07.360" style="s2">responsibility for the things i do and</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.600" end="01:30:08.960" style="s2">i&#39;ll listen to constructive criticism at</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.360" end="01:30:12.639" style="s2">all times and do all those things</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.960" end="01:30:15.760" style="s2">i think of it as contextuality and</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.639" end="01:30:16.880" style="s2">contextuality now means that we are so</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.760" end="01:30:19.440" style="s2">many new</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.880" end="01:30:21.440" style="s2">media so many new environments so many</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.440" end="01:30:24.239" style="s2">new interfaces like this one</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.440" end="01:30:25.600" style="s2">where on zoom we&#39;re doing a three zoom a</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.239" end="01:30:26.560" style="s2">format that was only invented a few</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.600" end="01:30:28.880" style="s2">months ago</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.560" end="01:30:30.960" style="s2">and uh we&#39;re experimenting with it as we</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.880" end="01:30:32.880" style="s2">go which we invented by the way no</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.960" end="01:30:35.040" style="s2">yeah at least the word three soon yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.880" end="01:30:35.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.840" end="01:30:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s widespread now three zooms and</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.360" end="01:30:42.000" style="s2">foursomes okay so</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.880" end="01:30:44.960" style="s2">um but that&#39;s a new interface</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.000" end="01:30:46.800" style="s2">it will require new rhetoric eventually</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.960" end="01:30:48.320" style="s2">uh i just think</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.800" end="01:30:50.080" style="s2">it&#39;s all again about a question of</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.320" end="01:30:51.120" style="s2">timing so when do you jump to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.080" end="01:30:53.199" style="s2">rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.120" end="01:30:54.639" style="s2">and and i&#39;m i&#39;m one of these people who</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.199" end="01:30:56.719" style="s2">says that okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.639" end="01:30:58.000" style="s2">if you go to the rhetoric too quickly</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.719" end="01:30:59.120" style="s2">the problem is you will kill the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.000" end="01:31:00.480" style="s2">trickster</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.120" end="01:31:03.040" style="s2">and this way jordan peterson agrees with</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.480" end="01:31:06.000" style="s2">me says that if you go too quickly to</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.040" end="01:31:08.159" style="s2">have to be saved in a certain way uh for</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.000" end="01:31:09.760" style="s2">example that to me historically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.159" end="01:31:10.960" style="s2">it&#39;s typical sort of little nervous</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.760" end="01:31:12.719" style="s2">middle class behavior</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.960" end="01:31:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just like okay don&#39;t use certain</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.719" end="01:31:15.360" style="s2">words don&#39;t behave in certain ways</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.000" end="01:31:16.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s impolite and somebody might</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.360" end="01:31:18.320" style="s2">be offended</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.159" end="01:31:20.080" style="s2">okay it always turns out that it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.320" end="01:31:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s some middle class church lady who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.080" end="01:31:23.520" style="s2">offended at all times right</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.440" end="01:31:25.440" style="s2">so some people take two offense very</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.520" end="01:31:28.000" style="s2">quickly and that is just</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.440" end="01:31:29.199" style="s2">human it happens all the time but if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.000" end="01:31:30.639" style="s2">learn from history</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.199" end="01:31:32.960" style="s2">i&#39;m one of these guys that says that</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.639" end="01:31:36.080" style="s2">okay rhetoric is fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.960" end="01:31:37.440" style="s2">absolutely needed and we will have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.080" end="01:31:39.760" style="s2">reinforce rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.440" end="01:31:41.280" style="s2">it&#39;s called moderation and censorship</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.760" end="01:31:43.360" style="s2">because we cannot have</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.280" end="01:31:45.280" style="s2">all the floodgates open at all times and</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.360" end="01:31:47.440" style="s2">then we&#39;re drenched in</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.280" end="01:31:49.120" style="s2">you know violent child porn or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.440" end="01:31:50.480" style="s2">evil man can come up with because man</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.120" end="01:31:52.560" style="s2">can come up with tons of evil right</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.480" end="01:31:54.239" style="s2">so we don&#39;t want that here right we</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.560" end="01:31:56.719" style="s2">there&#39;s certain limits to what we do</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.239" end="01:31:58.000" style="s2">we that&#39;s what we build we build a wall</p>

<p begin="01:33:16.800" end="01:33:19.840" style="s2">then working-class people will be</p>

<p begin="01:33:19.840" end="01:33:22.719" style="s2">people with different backgrounds will</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.120" end="01:33:23.520" style="s2">be excluded because they will feed an</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.719" end="01:33:26.480" style="s2">older part of it</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.520" end="01:33:28.400" style="s2">and we will not be inclusive so to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.480" end="01:33:29.760" style="s2">enclosed is that as long as we allow the</p>

<p begin="01:33:29.760" end="01:33:33.280" style="s2">to behave like an [ __ ] at times and</p>

<p begin="01:33:33.280" end="01:33:37.840" style="s2">and he after all fix this do not take</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.280" end="01:33:39.840" style="s2">responsibility for what they do the only</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.840" end="01:33:41.679" style="s2">archetype that is relieved of</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.840" end="01:33:42.639" style="s2">responsibility for their own actions the</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.679" end="01:33:44.400" style="s2">rest of us have to</p>

<p begin="01:33:44.400" end="01:33:47.600" style="s2">trickster is allowed to be in the room</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.760" end="01:33:48.960" style="s2">uncomfortable that anybody can feel</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.600" end="01:33:50.560" style="s2">welcome if they walk into the room as</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.960" end="01:33:52.639" style="s2">long as they speak the same language</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.560" end="01:33:53.760" style="s2">that is to me the lowest level rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.639" end="01:33:56.159" style="s2">i will have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.760" end="01:33:58.320" style="s2">accept and especially in experimental</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.159" end="01:34:00.560" style="s2">environments</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.320" end="01:34:02.239" style="s2">so we foster people during the intention</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.560" end="01:34:03.920" style="s2">process and the preparation process</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.239" end="01:34:05.679" style="s2">this is going to be a tough ride not</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.920" end="01:34:07.280" style="s2">tough in the sense that you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.679" end="01:34:09.360" style="s2">you know intensely challenged you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.280" end="01:34:10.800" style="s2">welcome to stay hang on in there</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.360" end="01:34:12.320" style="s2">but there will be people around who will</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.800" end="01:34:14.159" style="s2">start doing and saying things you never</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.320" end="01:34:16.159" style="s2">thought you&#39;d ever have to hear okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.159" end="01:34:18.000" style="s2">but just allow that to happen let it</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.159" end="01:34:19.040" style="s2">pass on and it&#39;s not you are responsible</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.000" end="01:34:20.320" style="s2">take care of it because we have</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.040" end="01:34:21.920" style="s2">moderators who do</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.320" end="01:34:24.239" style="s2">so rather look at the moderators and how</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.920" end="01:34:24.719" style="s2">they work and if they do that well</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.239" end="01:34:26.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.719" end="01:34:28.400" style="s2">perfect role models for you to want to</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.480" end="01:34:29.920" style="s2">become a moderator and make an even</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.400" end="01:34:32.000" style="s2">better environment</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.920" end="01:34:34.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s when rhetoric comes into the</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.000" end="01:34:35.040" style="s2">picture not not too early but but at the</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.000" end="01:34:37.520" style="s2">stage when you want to</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.040" end="01:34:39.120" style="s2">lift the whole level and again it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.520" end="01:34:41.440" style="s2">of the intentional process</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.120" end="01:34:43.679" style="s2">if part of the integration was it was a</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.440" end="01:34:44.560" style="s2">good it was a good weekend we shared</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.679" end="01:34:47.440" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.560" end="01:34:48.800" style="s2">but hey it was me and erin crueler and</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.440" end="01:34:50.000" style="s2">nastier than he would have to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.800" end="01:34:52.560" style="s2">a lot of that was just completely</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.000" end="01:34:54.159" style="s2">unnecessary then it becomes part of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.560" end="01:34:57.760" style="s2">next intentional process</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.159" end="01:35:00.800" style="s2">to include more rhetoric in the mix</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.760" end="01:35:02.000" style="s2">yeah and also i find when it&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.800" end="01:35:04.000" style="s2">atmosphere is</p>

<p begin="01:42:32.480" end="01:42:35.840" style="s2">spirituality the question is it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.159" end="01:42:36.320" style="s2">to be the congregation that takes care</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.840" end="01:42:37.840" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.320" end="01:42:39.760" style="s2">or is it just going to be these gurus</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.840" end="01:42:41.920" style="s2">who give you psychedelics and you pay</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.760" end="01:42:44.480" style="s2">you pay 3 000 for a long weekend with</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.920" end="01:42:47.679" style="s2">them where is that gonna end up</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.480" end="01:42:50.880" style="s2">yeah um well we&#39;re gonna see both and</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.679" end="01:42:53.600" style="s2">so my in some sense my response is that</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.880" end="01:42:54.719" style="s2">the digital interaction actually needs</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.600" end="01:42:56.880" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.719" end="01:42:59.199" style="s2">like what i&#39;m the vision that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.880" end="01:43:00.159" style="s2">wanted to be part of creating has always</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.199" end="01:43:03.119" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.159" end="01:43:04.719" style="s2">to establish a kind of um authentic and</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.119" end="01:43:07.840" style="s2">integris</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.719" end="01:43:09.440" style="s2">field of interaction where you can have</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.840" end="01:43:11.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay you&#39;re doing it in this</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.440" end="01:43:12.480" style="s2">way come step into this come step into</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.760" end="01:43:14.800" style="s2">this space</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.480" end="01:43:15.760" style="s2">speak your peace like you&#39;ll be heard</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.800" end="01:43:17.600" style="s2">and addressed</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.760" end="01:43:19.520" style="s2">and we can have confrontation we can do</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.600" end="01:43:20.480" style="s2">all the rest of it the answer is i kind</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.520" end="01:43:23.280" style="s2">of don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.480" end="01:43:24.080" style="s2">my personal interest is in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.280" end="01:43:27.520" style="s2">congregation</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.080" end="01:43:29.840" style="s2">style i&#39;m skeptical of gurus in general</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.520" end="01:43:31.920" style="s2">i think as a philosophical point</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.840" end="01:43:34.159" style="s2">i&#39;ve spent quite a lot of time listening</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.920" end="01:43:36.239" style="s2">to and like</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.159" end="01:43:37.280" style="s2">contemplating someone like adida for</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.239" end="01:43:40.560" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.280" end="01:43:42.320" style="s2">um and i am very very skeptical of</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.560" end="01:43:45.760" style="s2">someone placing themselves</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.320" end="01:43:47.679" style="s2">beyond you you should be having satsang</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.760" end="01:43:49.360" style="s2">together in some important sense right</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.679" end="01:43:50.880" style="s2">that you have to come have satsang with</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.360" end="01:43:52.480" style="s2">me and i&#39;m your portal</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.880" end="01:43:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like all right big man let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.480" end="01:43:55.760" style="s2">then okay i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.480" end="01:43:57.679" style="s2">so i&#39;m more on the side of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.760" end="01:43:59.199" style="s2">congregation to be honest with you</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.679" end="01:44:01.760" style="s2">we had that problem here in europe this</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.199" end="01:44:03.520" style="s2">year and there were so many of the older</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.760" end="01:44:04.719" style="s2">men who got so tired in men&#39;s work of</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.520" end="01:44:06.560" style="s2">just doing it for free</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.719" end="01:44:08.000" style="s2">and professionally trained therapists</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.560" end="01:44:09.520" style="s2">and things like that so we decided to</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.000" end="01:44:10.400" style="s2">split the movement but make it very</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.520" end="01:44:12.480" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.400" end="01:44:14.639" style="s2">that there&#39;s we call it the manifesto</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.480" end="01:44:16.239" style="s2">network which is a network of men who do</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.639" end="01:44:18.000" style="s2">men&#39;s events around europe and it works</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.239" end="01:44:20.000" style="s2">wonderfully it&#39;s flat in structured</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.000" end="01:44:22.560" style="s2">decentralized work for four years nobody</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.000" end="01:44:23.920" style="s2">gets paid but then we also started a</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.560" end="01:44:24.639" style="s2">manifesto core this year which is</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.920" end="01:44:28.000" style="s2">essentially an</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.639" end="01:44:29.920" style="s2">agency for appointed you know formal</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.000" end="01:44:31.520" style="s2">advisors and therapists and things who</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.920" end="01:44:33.199" style="s2">do men&#39;s work but do professionally and</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.520" end="01:44:34.719" style="s2">they will charge you some</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.199" end="01:44:36.560" style="s2">for doing the work they do because</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.719" end="01:44:38.159" style="s2">they&#39;re replacing other therapists and</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.560" end="01:44:40.320" style="s2">professional work and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.159" end="01:44:41.600" style="s2">i think it has to be this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.320" end="01:44:43.119" style="s2">division between the two that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.600" end="01:44:44.560" style="s2">love the burning man movement because</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.119" end="01:44:46.159" style="s2">eventually at the end of the day you had</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.560" end="01:44:47.679" style="s2">to employ a few people at birmingham at</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.159" end="01:44:48.639" style="s2">headquarters in san francisco to keep</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.679" end="01:44:50.239" style="s2">the machine together</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.639" end="01:44:51.760" style="s2">you gotta have some people in their work</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.239" end="01:44:53.760" style="s2">full-time like you&#39;ve got to have a</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.760" end="01:44:55.440" style="s2">priest or a pastor in your congregation</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.760" end="01:44:56.800" style="s2">you got to pay somebody to do the work</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.440" end="01:44:58.159" style="s2">you don&#39;t pay them a lot but you pay</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.800" end="01:44:58.800" style="s2">them so they can do it professionally</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.159" end="01:45:00.719" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.800" end="01:45:02.639" style="s2">but the rest of the work is all</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.719" end="01:45:03.040" style="s2">supporting one another in your spare</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.639" end="01:45:04.639" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.040" end="01:45:06.159" style="s2">outside of work and that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.639" end="01:45:08.320" style="s2">it goes so deeply spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.159" end="01:45:09.360" style="s2">and i think to define these the</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.320" end="01:45:10.960" style="s2">congregation</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.360" end="01:45:12.960" style="s2">versus the commercial activities i think</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.960" end="01:45:14.840" style="s2">the problem with new age was that it</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.960" end="01:45:16.239" style="s2">ended up as nothing but these guru</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.840" end="01:45:17.760" style="s2">weekends</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.239" end="01:45:19.920" style="s2">it was it was just a marketplace where</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.760" end="01:45:22.159" style="s2">he&#39;s like buy this crystal here and</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.920" end="01:45:24.400" style="s2">buy this stuff here go to see this guru</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.159" end="01:45:26.159" style="s2">here and you have to pay a lot for it</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.400" end="01:45:27.679" style="s2">to have somebody take you through portal</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.159" end="01:45:29.520" style="s2">or whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.679" end="01:45:30.800" style="s2">we know that&#39;s not spirituality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.520" end="01:45:33.119" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.800" end="01:45:34.320" style="s2">the best stuff is is you just find</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.119" end="01:45:36.159" style="s2">somewhere in an</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.320" end="01:45:38.159" style="s2">odd place and it&#39;s free you know you</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.159" end="01:45:40.560" style="s2">hardly pay anything for it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.159" end="01:45:42.080" style="s2">has way more actual value than the the</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.560" end="01:45:45.440" style="s2">guy who&#39;s charging uh</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.080" end="01:45:47.280" style="s2">you know thousands of euros an hour</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.440" end="01:45:48.800" style="s2">to to to do satsang with them or</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.280" end="01:45:50.320" style="s2">whatever the hell</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.800" end="01:45:51.360" style="s2">yeah i tried to work with those things</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.320" end="01:45:53.199" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m getting involved with the</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.360" end="01:45:54.159" style="s2">hackers in europe so that goes if they</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.199" end="01:45:56.080" style="s2">like me or not</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.159" end="01:45:57.760" style="s2">but burners and the men&#39;s movement and</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.080" end="01:45:59.040" style="s2">the hackers these are three movements</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.760" end="01:46:01.520" style="s2">that have emerged</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.040" end="01:46:02.960" style="s2">they already exist i don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.520" end="01:46:04.880" style="s2">one of the innovators of them</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.960" end="01:46:06.480" style="s2">they already exist they fascinate me</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.880" end="01:46:08.400" style="s2">they&#39;re flat in structure</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.480" end="01:46:10.320" style="s2">and they work towards a common shared</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.400" end="01:46:11.679" style="s2">goal which is way bigger than any</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.320" end="01:46:13.920" style="s2">personal goal could ever be</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.679" end="01:46:16.239" style="s2">like fixing the men so the women have</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.920" end="01:46:18.000" style="s2">some men to marry like men&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.239" end="01:46:20.080" style="s2">burners it&#39;s just like exploring the</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.000" end="01:46:22.639" style="s2">possibility of creating</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.080" end="01:46:24.400" style="s2">temporary communist utopias and go into</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.639" end="01:46:26.480" style="s2">that experience as a full-on spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.400" end="01:46:27.920" style="s2">exercise where everybody else is there</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.480" end="01:46:29.280" style="s2">needs this as much as you do</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.920" end="01:46:31.199" style="s2">and everybody else is there is there</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.280" end="01:46:32.719" style="s2">without getting paid for it that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.199" end="01:46:34.080" style="s2">a deeply spiritual experience</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.719" end="01:46:35.679" style="s2">and the same thing with the hackers</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.080" end="01:46:36.719" style="s2">because today if you look at the world</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.679" end="01:46:39.040" style="s2">politically</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.719" end="01:46:40.480" style="s2">fighting communist china&#39;s dictatorship</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.040" end="01:46:41.840" style="s2">is probably the coolest thing you can do</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.480" end="01:46:43.600" style="s2">you can&#39;t be anything cool than a</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.840" end="01:46:45.199" style="s2">taiwanese hacker who tries to get</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.600" end="01:46:46.800" style="s2">through chinese censorship</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.199" end="01:46:48.080" style="s2">and i think hackers again they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.800" end="01:46:49.280" style="s2">this in their spare time they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.080" end="01:46:53.119" style="s2">it for the love it they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.280" end="01:46:54.880" style="s2">because it is a good thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.119" end="01:46:56.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what right is that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.880" end="01:46:58.800" style="s2">word amateur means it means in italian</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.960" end="01:46:59.199" style="s2">it means to do what you love or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.800" end="01:47:01.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.199" end="01:47:03.520" style="s2">to love what you do so it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.440" end="01:47:05.840" style="s2">amateur activity where you&#39;re motivated</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.520" end="01:47:08.239" style="s2">you have a pure motivation right</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.840" end="01:47:09.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a mixed motivation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.239" end="01:47:11.679" style="s2">not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.040" end="01:47:13.040" style="s2">seduce or you know somebody else do you</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.679" end="01:47:15.679" style="s2">mean that i have to stop calling myself</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.040" end="01:47:21.520" style="s2">an amateur [ __ ] now</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.679" end="01:47:21.520" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re you&#39;re a professional thing</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.040" end="01:47:32.960" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting so maybe just a nod</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.199" end="01:47:36.320" style="s2">to a future conversation</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.960" end="01:47:37.840" style="s2">might be to um discuss the</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.320" end="01:47:39.360" style="s2">i&#39;m very interested in your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.840" end="01:47:42.239" style="s2">about hierarchy you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.360" end="01:47:43.520" style="s2">flat structure i can&#39;t speak to this</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.239" end="01:47:45.760" style="s2">stuff with um</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.520" end="01:47:47.440" style="s2">articulate language but in the in an</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.760" end="01:47:49.360" style="s2">image the image in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.440" end="01:47:51.520" style="s2">is is not a flat structure but something</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.360" end="01:47:55.119" style="s2">like a wave right that can</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.520" end="01:47:58.159" style="s2">come together and have um</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.119" end="01:48:01.840" style="s2">discernible uh</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.159" end="01:48:03.520" style="s2">teacherly authority or</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.840" end="01:48:04.719" style="s2">individuals who can disseminate wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.520" end="01:48:05.600" style="s2">and of course this is something i know</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.719" end="01:48:07.199" style="s2">you agree with it</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.600" end="01:48:08.560" style="s2">flows into the rest of our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.199" end="01:48:10.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the people who have the</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.560" end="01:48:11.520" style="s2">knowledge they&#39;ve got the skills they</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.080" end="01:48:14.560" style="s2">have your particular archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.520" end="01:48:16.639" style="s2">so how can we lead and follow it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.560" end="01:48:18.320" style="s2">a dance hey where one leads at one time</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.639" end="01:48:18.719" style="s2">one follows that another and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.320" end="01:48:22.159" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.719" end="01:48:24.480" style="s2">the capacity to discern when to you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.159" end="01:48:26.400" style="s2">embody which role and it doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.480" end="01:48:28.239" style="s2">like a flat thing it looks like a</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.400" end="01:48:29.840" style="s2">it looks like a wave to me looks like</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.239" end="01:48:31.920" style="s2">something dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.840" end="01:48:33.920" style="s2">yeah we could call the good microherikis</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.920" end="01:48:35.520" style="s2">if you prefer that word i i&#39;m not scared</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.920" end="01:48:37.520" style="s2">of the word heroic individuals why not</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.520" end="01:48:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a great word it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.520" end="01:48:42.159" style="s2">patriarchy is a great word you just have</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.520" end="01:48:43.679" style="s2">met jorge next to it for god&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.159" end="01:48:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s mad turkey that was lacking it</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.679" end="01:48:47.840" style="s2">wasn&#39;t patrick it was too much of</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.440" end="01:48:49.520" style="s2">so take back these words and redefine</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.840" end="01:48:51.280" style="s2">them i used the word god in my work i</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.520" end="01:48:53.679" style="s2">just put god into the future</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.280" end="01:48:54.560" style="s2">if god doesn&#39;t exist yet then he could</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.679" end="01:48:57.040" style="s2">certainly or she</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.560" end="01:48:58.960" style="s2">whatever could exist in the future so</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.040" end="01:49:01.360" style="s2">let&#39;s take back these words and</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.960" end="01:49:02.560" style="s2">use them again and for example i used</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.360" end="01:49:04.000" style="s2">during a conversation i talked about</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.560" end="01:49:05.280" style="s2">wisdom and energy and the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.000" end="01:49:07.600" style="s2">between the older the</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.280" end="01:49:09.360" style="s2">the older mentor and the young mentee so</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.600" end="01:49:11.119" style="s2">in the mentorship relationship of course</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.360" end="01:49:13.840" style="s2">there&#39;s there are two hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.119" end="01:49:14.880" style="s2">one here is the heritage wisdom the</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.840" end="01:49:17.760" style="s2">older</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.880" end="01:49:19.840" style="s2">mentor is supposed to know more within</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.760" end="01:49:20.239" style="s2">that archetype and therefore teach and</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.840" end="01:49:22.239" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.239" end="01:49:23.520" style="s2">the younger person but the younger</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.239" end="01:49:26.880" style="s2">person has inherited</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.520" end="01:49:28.080" style="s2">energy so what you contribute to any</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.880" end="01:49:30.239" style="s2">environment you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.080" end="01:49:31.679" style="s2">you&#39;re at the top of that hierarchy so</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.239" end="01:49:32.239" style="s2">if you cook the food in a group of</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.679" end="01:49:34.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.239" end="01:49:35.199" style="s2">you&#39;re at the top of the food hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.000" end="01:49:36.800" style="s2">because you&#39;re responsible for the</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.199" end="01:49:38.719" style="s2">kitchen you cook the food</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.800" end="01:49:40.960" style="s2">that&#39;s hierarchy that&#39;s what hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.719" end="01:49:44.080" style="s2">is hierarchy is the way</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.960" end="01:49:46.560" style="s2">an emergent collective</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.080" end="01:49:48.159" style="s2">quickly organized itself into different</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.560" end="01:49:50.880" style="s2">archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.159" end="01:49:51.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s a yes it&#39;s a natural process</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.880" end="01:49:54.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.520" end="01:49:54.639" style="s2">yeah yeah it will happen quite quickly</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.159" end="01:49:57.920" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.639" end="01:50:00.080" style="s2">what i mean with flat it&#39;s that the sums</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.920" end="01:50:02.239" style="s2">overall are flat in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.080" end="01:50:04.159" style="s2">nobody has an officially dominant</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.239" end="01:50:05.199" style="s2">position where they can say yes or no to</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.159" end="01:50:06.800" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.199" end="01:50:09.599" style="s2">so what you do for example if you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.800" end="01:50:11.280" style="s2">a large flat network of 500 men in</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.599" end="01:50:12.000" style="s2">europe all work with men&#39;s events and</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.280" end="01:50:14.320" style="s2">men&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.000" end="01:50:15.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s a lot of very you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.320" end="01:50:17.360" style="s2">bullheaded men there</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.679" end="01:50:19.119" style="s2">the way you do it that&#39;s you basically</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.360" end="01:50:20.960" style="s2">point a few guys to be moderated so the</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.119" end="01:50:22.320" style="s2">group and place them on a slightly</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.960" end="01:50:24.400" style="s2">higher level because they actually have</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.320" end="01:50:26.159" style="s2">an authority that other guys don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.400" end="01:50:28.000" style="s2">but you&#39;re aware of that and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.159" end="01:50:29.520" style="s2">you need to do to keep the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.000" end="01:50:32.239" style="s2">hierarchy as flat as you</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.520" end="01:50:33.520" style="s2">as you can because you think that</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.239" end="01:50:35.679" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.520" end="01:50:37.840" style="s2">works best when it&#39;s decentralized and</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.679" end="01:50:38.480" style="s2">it very often turns out to be the case</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.840" end="01:50:41.280" style="s2">when you go</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.480" end="01:50:42.320" style="s2">going to compare cultures and compare</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.280" end="01:50:44.960" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.320" end="01:50:46.159" style="s2">and compare role modeling that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.960" end="01:50:47.760" style="s2">it&#39;s great to have a decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.159" end="01:50:49.520" style="s2">network but when you&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.760" end="01:50:51.360" style="s2">implement an order so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.520" end="01:50:52.560" style="s2">have to build this building now</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.360" end="01:50:54.159" style="s2">you don&#39;t wanna have people sitting</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.560" end="01:50:56.080" style="s2">around forever circling talk about their</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.159" end="01:50:58.400" style="s2">feelings no you want them to get up</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.080" end="01:50:59.840" style="s2">each take their responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.400" end="01:51:01.679" style="s2">thing they&#39;ve been appointed to do and</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.840" end="01:51:02.639" style="s2">then go off and do it so the building</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.679" end="01:51:04.000" style="s2">gets built</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.639" end="01:51:06.480" style="s2">that&#39;s different that&#39;s a different type</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.000" end="01:51:06.480" style="s2">of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.960" end="01:51:10.239" style="s2">yeah beautiful i&#39;m interested the</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.320" end="01:51:12.000" style="s2">relationship between uh the moderator</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.239" end="01:51:13.119" style="s2">and the shaman can you speak to that at</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.000" end="01:51:16.080" style="s2">all are these</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.119" end="01:51:17.040" style="s2">like are these different in your</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.080" end="01:51:20.719" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.040" end="01:51:23.119" style="s2">in your view yeah moderator is priestly</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.719" end="01:51:24.320" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s shamanic but inside the</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.119" end="01:51:26.880" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.320" end="01:51:28.480" style="s2">okay sheamus prefer to be outside</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.880" end="01:51:30.000" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.480" end="01:51:31.760" style="s2">you find them living in the forest</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.000" end="01:51:33.360" style="s2">cooking witch&#39;s brews most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.760" end="01:51:34.480" style="s2">they take tons of drugs they often die</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.360" end="01:51:36.000" style="s2">young and they experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.480" end="01:51:37.760" style="s2">themselves their surroundings in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.000" end="01:51:38.159" style="s2">most hideous ways and that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.760" end="01:51:40.480" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.159" end="01:51:42.239" style="s2">shamanoids they call them shamanoid is</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.480" end="01:51:43.760" style="s2">actually the psychological term for</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.239" end="01:51:45.599" style="s2">shamanic people so</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.760" end="01:51:47.440" style="s2">we expect about four percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.599" end="01:51:48.000" style="s2">population to strong characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.440" end="01:51:50.159" style="s2">that are called</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.000" end="01:51:52.159" style="s2">chaminade these are people that are</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.159" end="01:51:53.679" style="s2">often better off outside in the forest</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.159" end="01:51:56.159" style="s2">living away from society</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.679" end="01:51:58.320" style="s2">they have been idolized over the last</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.159" end="01:51:59.599" style="s2">say 50 to 100 years way more than they</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.320" end="01:52:01.679" style="s2">expected to that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.599" end="01:52:03.040" style="s2">dying rock stars as role models which i</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.679" end="01:52:04.639" style="s2">think was a terrible idea to be honest</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.040" end="01:52:07.440" style="s2">about it even if it was fun</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.639" end="01:52:09.199" style="s2">okay but the shamanic characters are</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.440" end="01:52:10.800" style="s2">like that but when the shamans work</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.199" end="01:52:12.800" style="s2">within the tribal environment</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.800" end="01:52:14.800" style="s2">and put on a robe a priest is</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.800" end="01:52:16.880" style="s2">essentially one of the shamans</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.800" end="01:52:18.800" style="s2">who takes on a robe to go into the</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.880" end="01:52:21.520" style="s2">community to take on shamanic</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.800" end="01:52:23.599" style="s2">responsibilities and shamanic is always</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.520" end="01:52:26.320" style="s2">go between</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.599" end="01:52:27.199" style="s2">the his goal between between tribes is</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.320" end="01:52:30.320" style="s2">go between</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.199" end="01:52:31.760" style="s2">between man and the gods and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.320" end="01:52:33.599" style="s2">between between men and women</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.760" end="01:52:35.360" style="s2">and then it&#39;s called androgynous people</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.599" end="01:52:37.199" style="s2">that&#39;s what androgynous characters are</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.360" end="01:52:38.400" style="s2">similar to shamanic characters and</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.199" end="01:52:39.440" style="s2">they&#39;re another four percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.400" end="01:52:41.760" style="s2">overall population</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.440" end="01:52:43.679" style="s2">so these tiny minorities the androgynous</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.760" end="01:52:44.880" style="s2">caste and the shamanic cast are people</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.679" end="01:52:45.520" style="s2">we should really care about in our</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.880" end="01:52:47.280" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.520" end="01:52:49.679" style="s2">but we should also put them in the right</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.280" end="01:52:50.560" style="s2">place and not idolize them as a norm for</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.679" end="01:52:52.719" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.560" end="01:52:54.400" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why the lgbt movement</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.719" end="01:52:55.760" style="s2">went overboard in the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.400" end="01:52:57.119" style="s2">when instead of fighting for its own</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.760" end="01:52:58.719" style="s2">rights and being proud of itself it</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.119" end="01:52:59.040" style="s2">started to react like everybody had to</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.719" end="01:53:01.199" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.040" end="01:53:02.880" style="s2">like them that that that is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.199" end="01:53:06.080" style="s2">where things start to go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.880" end="01:53:08.719" style="s2">so i am totally pro androgynous cast</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.080" end="01:53:09.920" style="s2">totally pro-shamanic cast work and these</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.719" end="01:53:12.159" style="s2">people in my work</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.920" end="01:53:14.159" style="s2">adamant about it too but when the</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.159" end="01:53:15.280" style="s2">shamans or the androgynous people take</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.159" end="01:53:16.960" style="s2">on robes</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.280" end="01:53:18.719" style="s2">to live within the community of the</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.960" end="01:53:20.480" style="s2">inner circle or the outer circuit</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.719" end="01:53:22.560" style="s2">the matriarch of the patriarchy which</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.480" end="01:53:24.960" style="s2">are the dominant modes of society</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.560" end="01:53:27.360" style="s2">then they can come become for example a</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.960" end="01:53:29.199" style="s2">moderator and a moderator is why it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.360" end="01:53:31.280" style="s2">person with experience</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.199" end="01:53:32.719" style="s2">it could be tough when needed and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.280" end="01:53:35.199" style="s2">not invested</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.719" end="01:53:36.159" style="s2">in the value of the group so it cannot</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.199" end="01:53:39.520" style="s2">be corrupted</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.159" end="01:53:40.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a good moderator always appoint</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.520" end="01:53:41.840" style="s2">the person</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.000" end="01:53:43.040" style="s2">who&#39;s been around for a while seen this</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.840" end="01:53:45.040" style="s2">and that and can take on that</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.040" end="01:53:46.719" style="s2">responsibility listen i&#39;ll take it on</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.040" end="01:53:48.400" style="s2">i&#39;ll be the moderator next year you can</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.719" end="01:53:50.080" style="s2">decide whether i did a good job or not</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.400" end="01:53:51.280" style="s2">and elect me again or pick somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.080" end="01:53:52.639" style="s2">but i&#39;m going to be here for a year i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.280" end="01:53:54.719" style="s2">going to moderate this group</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.639" end="01:53:56.320" style="s2">and because i&#39;m not too much invested in</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.719" end="01:53:58.719" style="s2">the group itself</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.320" end="01:54:00.320" style="s2">then i&#39;m a good moderator otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.719" end="01:54:01.679" style="s2">you&#39;re picking a guru and it becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.320" end="01:54:03.599" style="s2">sec leader</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.679" end="01:54:05.040" style="s2">and you got a sect and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.599" end="01:54:07.520" style="s2">actually have a thriving community</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.040" end="01:54:08.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem so another thing with</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.520" end="01:54:11.280" style="s2">the moderator</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.800" end="01:54:12.239" style="s2">pick several have a few of them we trust</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.280" end="01:54:13.920" style="s2">each other but they have different</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.239" end="01:54:14.800" style="s2">backgrounds different cultures different</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.920" end="01:54:16.800" style="s2">genders</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.800" end="01:54:18.239" style="s2">uh you know they can represent the</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.800" end="01:54:19.599" style="s2">outside world in different ways and</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.239" end="01:54:21.520" style="s2">that&#39;s when you get a good mix of</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.599" end="01:54:24.560" style="s2">moderators and the bigger the forum gets</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.520" end="01:54:24.560" style="s2">the more moderators you need</p>
