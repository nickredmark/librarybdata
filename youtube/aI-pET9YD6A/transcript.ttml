<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t know you&#39;ve probably come across</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.890" end="00:00:06.120" style="s2">this little diagram in the book and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.990" end="00:00:07.589" style="s2">quite a complicated diagram so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:11.240" style="s2">to just walk you through it a bit and</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.589" end="00:00:11.240" style="s2">then I&#39;ll tell you the Egyptian story so</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.540" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">this is this is a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.949" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">interconnected causal loops so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">question might be well how does morality</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:22.740" style="s2">emerge from the bottom and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:25.410" style="s2">well especially the morality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">associated with assuming that attention</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.410" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">is something that&#39;s sacred roughly</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:32.430" style="s2">speaking okay so imagine you see someone</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">really engaged in something you might</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.430" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">think oh I&#39;d really like to be engaged</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">like that which is what you would think</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">right because everyone wants that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">like I&#39;d like to be engaged okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">you might think well this person looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">like they&#39;re fully alive something like</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">that they&#39;re not being obsessed by</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:51.149" style="s2">catastrophes and all that they&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing what&#39;s that like okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.149" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">say well that&#39;s associated with creative</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">exploration and then you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">what why is creative exploration useful</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:02.600" style="s2">and the answer to that is because it can</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">generate adaptive behavior of all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.600" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">okay so then what well then you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:09.090" style="s2">imitate the adaptive behavior because we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:11.580" style="s2">can use our bodies as representational</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.090" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">devices so we act out the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.580" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">interested in something so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">actually in large part why people like</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">to buy art you know so lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen buy art they like to buy art</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">because they also have some contact with</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">the artist and they want to have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">contact with the artist because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.680" style="s2">kind of cool to have contact with an</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">artist it brings something into their</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.680" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">life and the artist is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">someone who&#39;s outside standard</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">hierarchies that&#39;s sort of what defines</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">an artist so then once you imitate the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:41.189" style="s2">adaptive behavior then you can play</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">around with the imitations a bit and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.189" end="00:01:45.450" style="s2">can ritualize them and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">dramatize them and a drama is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.450" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">interesting thing once it gets</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">once it gets formalized you know because</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">basically what you&#39;re doing imagine</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">little kids that get together they lay</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:59.130" style="s2">out some rules for pretend play then</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">they run a sprint and play a simulation</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.130" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">then imagine like little Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">junior is off to the side and he&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:07.740" style="s2">some notes and maybe he watches six or</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">seven different pretend play episodes</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.740" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">and he thinks well this was the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">interesting part of that and this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">the most interesting part of that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">was the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">part of that I think I&#39;ll put those all</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:19.770" style="s2">together make them coherent we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:23.610" style="s2">really good story and what the story is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.770" end="00:02:26.100" style="s2">is an articulated representation of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">dramatic representation of a set of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.100" end="00:02:30.330" style="s2">procedures it&#39;s two orders of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">abstraction right and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.330" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">because when you read a book I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen to me anymore because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:38.010" style="s2">think I&#39;ve read too many books but I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:40.020" style="s2">remember when I was a kid when I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:43.860" style="s2">reading a book of fiction it was as if</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.020" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">the the the what was being described was</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.860" end="00:02:48.030" style="s2">playing out in my imagination as</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">embodied figures so you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.030" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">you go to a movie of a book you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:53.130" style="s2">and you think oh that person doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:54.269" style="s2">look anything like the person in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.130" end="00:02:55.950" style="s2">book you know because you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.269" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">representation of what the person is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.950" end="00:03:00.180" style="s2">like I found as I&#39;ve got older that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t really understand this is I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:04.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have that anymore but I still</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:06.269" style="s2">understand the books so I must have</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.440" end="00:03:09.300" style="s2">become so otama ties that that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.269" end="00:03:13.709" style="s2">gone it&#39;s it&#39;s a loss I would say but</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.300" end="00:03:16.019" style="s2">anyway it doesn&#39;t matter you see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.709" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">once you get the bloody drama written</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.019" end="00:03:19.890" style="s2">down or even when you can say it when</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">you can tell a story you&#39;re so close to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.890" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">having the the pattern revealed in an</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">articulated manner you can&#39;t say what</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">the pattern is but you can describe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:32.579" style="s2">well once you can describe it well</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">you&#39;re right next to philosophy right as</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.579" end="00:03:36.090" style="s2">soon as we have a set of dramas that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:37.860" style="s2">can all agree on especially once they</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:40.200" style="s2">get written down then we can start</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.860" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">thinking about the dramas and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.200" end="00:03:44.549" style="s2">when philosophy enters the stage as far</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">as I can tell it&#39;s like the groundwork</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.549" end="00:03:48.510" style="s2">for philosophy is already laid by</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:51.060" style="s2">centuries and centuries of human</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">interaction and we keep abstracting that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.060" end="00:03:54.900" style="s2">up to the point where we can represent</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:56.579" style="s2">it and then we can pull out general</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.900" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">principles and we discuss them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.579" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">debate about them but that&#39;s the birth</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:02.910" style="s2">of philosophy and all those levels</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:05.070" style="s2">interplay like it&#39;s not just the causal</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.910" end="00:04:07.049" style="s2">direction isn&#39;t just from creative</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.070" end="00:04:09.600" style="s2">exploration forward it&#39;s each time you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.049" end="00:04:11.670" style="s2">add a new level that interacts with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.600" end="00:04:13.709" style="s2">previous level right so you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.670" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">about how you&#39;re going to play or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.709" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">can analyze literature you know or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:20.070" style="s2">can think about what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">write about so so each time you add</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.070" end="00:04:22.950" style="s2">another level of the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:25.200" style="s2">abstraction you make the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.950" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">much more dynamic and complex so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.200" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">causal links that&#39;s why there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:34.940" style="s2">arrows on the outside all of those areas</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:34.940" style="s2">are interacting with each other so yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.870" end="00:04:46.190" style="s2">yeah too many arrows yeah let me show</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.620" end="00:04:49.200" style="s2">you something here this is quite cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.190" end="00:04:51.690" style="s2">see that did I show you that before oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.200" end="00:04:55.830" style="s2">this is so cool it&#39;s mind-boggling this</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:57.210" style="s2">thing okay so the horizontal line you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.830" end="00:04:59.190" style="s2">see all the little squiggles that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.210" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">underneath that okay every one of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.190" end="00:05:03.930" style="s2">lines is a biblical verse and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:06.150" style="s2">length of the line corresponds to how</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.930" end="00:05:09.630" style="s2">many references there is to that verse</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.150" end="00:05:11.100" style="s2">in other places in the book so you look</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.630" end="00:05:13.560" style="s2">at the bloody thing man that thing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.100" end="00:05:15.780" style="s2">hyperlinked like mad and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.560" end="00:05:17.760" style="s2">why the book the you know think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.780" end="00:05:20.760" style="s2">this book like a normal book really what</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.760" end="00:05:22.140" style="s2">you do know you go see a movie and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.760" end="00:05:23.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a timeline there&#39;s a beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.140" end="00:05:26.100" style="s2">and a middle and an end</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.430" end="00:05:27.900" style="s2">but it&#39;s a losery right because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.100" end="00:05:29.910" style="s2">person who was writing the movie saw the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.900" end="00:05:31.470" style="s2">whole thing at once and so they could</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.910" end="00:05:33.330" style="s2">use their knowledge of the ending to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.470" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">fiddle around with the beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.330" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">they could use their knowledge of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:38.520" style="s2">middle to fiddle around with the end</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:40.590" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t happen in real life so you</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.520" end="00:05:43.230" style="s2">can lay this out now imagine you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.590" end="00:05:46.140" style="s2">a story and it&#39;s like 5,000 years old</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.230" end="00:05:48.180" style="s2">and 150,000 people have edited it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:49.620" style="s2">they all knew the end and the middle and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2">the beginning and they just go like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.620" end="00:05:53.070" style="s2">well this means this and that refers to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.270" end="00:05:54.870" style="s2">this and that refers to this and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.070" end="00:06:00.900" style="s2">refers to this and this means that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.870" end="00:06:03.930" style="s2">well you end up with that it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.900" end="00:06:04.530" style="s2">infinitely dense you can&#39;t get to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.930" end="00:06:06.330" style="s2">bottom of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.530" end="00:06:09.030" style="s2">there&#39;s no way and really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.330" end="00:06:11.100" style="s2">hyperlinked so you I could you could say</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.030" end="00:06:13.950" style="s2">that in a sense the Bible is the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.100" end="00:06:17.240" style="s2">first fully hyperlinked document weird</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.950" end="00:06:17.240" style="s2">so yep</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.650" end="00:06:25.720" style="s2">yes and and part of that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.080" end="00:06:27.010" style="s2">that&#39;s actually conscious like one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.720" end="00:06:30.220" style="s2">the things that people do when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.010" end="00:06:31.780" style="s2">criticizing Christianity is say well if</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.220" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">you look at the gospel stories for</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.780" end="00:06:35.290" style="s2">example they&#39;ll be a little story about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.750" style="s2">Christ and then there&#39;ll be this line</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.290" end="00:06:40.300" style="s2">that says thus fulfilling Isaiah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.750" end="00:06:41.860" style="s2">prophecy and the biblical scholars say</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.300" end="00:06:43.389" style="s2">look that was put in later and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.860" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">reason it was put in later was because</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.389" end="00:06:52.060" style="s2">the the hypothesis of the Savior is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:53.830" style="s2">nested in the Old Testament and it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.060" end="00:06:56.470" style="s2">partially coming true with all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.830" end="00:06:59.350" style="s2">prophets so a prophet is like a partial</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.470" end="00:07:01.240" style="s2">Savior and in the Old Testament prophets</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.350" end="00:07:03.789" style="s2">are just popping up like mad and usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.240" end="00:07:05.260" style="s2">what happens is Israel gets degenerate</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.789" end="00:07:06.910" style="s2">for one reason or another it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.260" end="00:07:09.699" style="s2">the king isn&#39;t being a good Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.910" end="00:07:11.470" style="s2">basically and so then a prophet who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.699" end="00:07:13.539" style="s2">very insightful like Nietzsche or</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.470" end="00:07:15.460" style="s2">Dostoyevsky pops up and says hey you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.539" end="00:07:17.410" style="s2">don&#39;t pay attention to the orphans and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.460" end="00:07:18.820" style="s2">the widows and you better get your art</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.410" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">together because otherwise God&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.820" end="00:07:23.770" style="s2">come along and like flood you out or</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">your enemies are gonna stream in and of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.770" end="00:07:27.610" style="s2">course often weirdly enough the Kings</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:29.860" style="s2">listen because they think god this</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.610" end="00:07:31.630" style="s2">person is either completely insane or or</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.860" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">God&#39;s talking ding because otherwise he</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.630" end="00:07:35.229" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be marching into the court when</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:37.960" style="s2">I could have his head cut off with one</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.229" end="00:07:40.090" style="s2">tenths of a seconds or ders so often</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.960" end="00:07:41.740" style="s2">they kind of half pay attention but what</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.090" end="00:07:43.630" style="s2">happens and this is Dora a Fry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.740" end="00:07:45.970" style="s2">interpretation fundamentally is that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.630" end="00:07:48.910" style="s2">whole Testament is the construction of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.970" end="00:07:51.550" style="s2">an empire Israel it&#39;s collapsed because</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.910" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">of its failure to follow the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.550" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">moral order then it rises again</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:07:59.410" style="s2">collapses rises again collapses the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:02.260" style="s2">first story like that is the flood right</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.410" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really really old story you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.260" end="00:08:07.270" style="s2">know that the Bible doesn&#39;t get quasi</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">historic until Abraham the stories</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.270" end="00:08:13.630" style="s2">before that so that would be like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:18.250" style="s2">creation of the world Adam and Eve the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.630" end="00:08:21.430" style="s2">Tower of Babel Cain and Abel don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.250" end="00:08:22.930" style="s2">that&#39;s later Noah and then then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.430" end="00:08:24.340" style="s2">Abrahamic stories start and that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.930" end="00:08:26.470" style="s2">like the history of Israel even though</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.340" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s also mythologized but the first set</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.470" end="00:08:31.750" style="s2">of stories man those things are old who</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:34.200" style="s2">knows how old really old 50 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.750" end="00:08:37.110" style="s2">years old maybe they&#39;re old</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.200" end="00:08:38.849" style="s2">so anyways what happens across time is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.110" end="00:08:39.870" style="s2">that people have all these biblical</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.849" end="00:08:41.880" style="s2">books and it&#39;s like what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.870" end="00:08:43.289" style="s2">Mesopotamians had to do in order to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.880" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">organize their society it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.289" end="00:08:47.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve got all these writings they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:48.120" style="s2">sacred hypothetically they contradict</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.399" end="00:08:50.339" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.120" end="00:08:51.720" style="s2">they don&#39;t seem to be in any order like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.339" end="00:08:53.730" style="s2">what are we going to do about that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:57.540" style="s2">so then there&#39;s this collaboration of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.730" end="00:08:58.949" style="s2">minds across centuries to think oh well</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.540" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">it kind of looks like this might go</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.949" end="00:09:02.220" style="s2">there and then this might go there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.290" style="s2">this refers to that and this refers to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.220" end="00:09:07.139" style="s2">that and so it is that&#39;s Thai it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.290" end="00:09:09.630" style="s2">trying to it&#39;s the collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.139" end="00:09:13.230" style="s2">imagination of humanity trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.630" end="00:09:16.529" style="s2">coherent story out of experience that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.230" end="00:09:19.970" style="s2">what it is and you know it&#39;s you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.529" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">say well it&#39;s our best guess is it true</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.970" end="00:09:24.500" style="s2">depends what you mean by true right</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:27.149" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very tricky question</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.500" end="00:09:30.180" style="s2">partly this the question it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.149" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">answer is how should you act that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.180" end="00:09:34.250" style="s2">the story that&#39;s not a scientific story</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:41.490" style="s2">but it&#39;s a bloody important question</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.250" end="00:09:47.399" style="s2">okay good so Egypt I felt like you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.490" end="00:09:50.130" style="s2">the story of who discovered buoyancy he</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.399" end="00:09:52.440" style="s2">ran through the streets Eureka</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.130" end="00:09:54.269" style="s2">who was it Archimedes okay so our</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.440" end="00:09:56.370" style="s2">comedians was trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.269" end="00:09:57.720" style="s2">to measure the volume of something and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.370" end="00:10:00.570" style="s2">he I think he wanted to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.720" end="00:10:02.730" style="s2">you&#39;d determined whether an alloy was</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.570" end="00:10:04.170" style="s2">pure gold or not so you&#39;d have to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.730" end="00:10:05.790" style="s2">the volume of the damn thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.170" end="00:10:07.800" style="s2">maybe add a clump of metal there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.790" end="00:10:09.269" style="s2">way you could measure then he figured</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.800" end="00:10:12.600" style="s2">out that if you had a tub full of water</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.269" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">and you drop the thing in it the amount</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.600" end="00:10:15.990" style="s2">of water that spilled over the edges</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.269" style="s2">would tell you exactly how big the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.990" end="00:10:20.040" style="s2">was and then you could weigh your thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.269" end="00:10:22.140" style="s2">your metal and you could tell what</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.040" end="00:10:23.699" style="s2">proportion of it was gold and so he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.140" end="00:10:24.930" style="s2">so thrilled about that he theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.699" end="00:10:26.579" style="s2">he discovered that when he was in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.930" end="00:10:27.029" style="s2">bathtub he got it in the water spilled</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.579" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.029" end="00:10:30.630" style="s2">he ran naked through the streets of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:34.440" style="s2">whatever town he was in yelling Eureka</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.630" end="00:10:36.630" style="s2">Eureka I&#39;ve got it so so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.440" end="00:10:38.610" style="s2">insight right so I felt like that when i</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.630" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">when i read this egyptian story and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.610" end="00:10:42.209" style="s2">thought i figured it out so because i</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.230" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">thought wow that&#39;s mind boggling so</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.209" end="00:10:47.810" style="s2">here&#39;s the story so we got to show you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:47.810" style="s2">some of these characters</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.370" end="00:11:00.950" style="s2">Noorie so the guy in the middle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.770" end="00:11:02.750" style="s2">Osiris he&#39;s on this pillar so he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.950" end="00:11:05.720" style="s2">represents what pillars represent which</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.750" end="00:11:09.590" style="s2">is what hold things up okay and then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.720" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">guy on the Left that&#39;s Horus and Horus</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.590" end="00:11:13.820" style="s2">is he&#39;s got the head of a Falken okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:16.010" style="s2">and the reason for that is that Falcons</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:17.750" style="s2">fly around so they&#39;re not attached to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.010" end="00:11:19.880" style="s2">the ground and they can really really</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.750" end="00:11:21.230" style="s2">really really see like their birds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.880" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">prey and they&#39;re about the only animal</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.230" end="00:11:25.670" style="s2">who can see better than us so like</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:28.190" style="s2">Raptors birds of prey they can see like</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.670" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">mad think an eagle that eagle was</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.190" end="00:11:31.520" style="s2">standing on the top of the Empire State</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:34.580" style="s2">Building it could see a dime on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.520" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">sidewalk so it&#39;s like gold eagle and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.580" end="00:11:40.190" style="s2">then the one on the right is Isis and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.220" end="00:11:41.540" style="s2">Isis is queen of the underworld okay and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.190" end="00:11:43.310" style="s2">then there&#39;s one other character here</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.540" end="00:11:46.220" style="s2">you see that&#39;s a madonna and child</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.310" end="00:11:50.390" style="s2">basically there are that character that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.220" end="00:11:52.370" style="s2">Seth and Seth is he&#39;s a bad guy now no</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.390" end="00:11:53.780" style="s2">one knows what the hell Seth is you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.370" end="00:11:58.010" style="s2">nobody&#39;s been able to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.780" end="00:12:01.220" style="s2">kind of weird animal that is so who</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.010" end="00:12:02.810" style="s2">knows but those are the four main</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.220" end="00:12:06.170" style="s2">characters okay so now you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.810" end="00:12:09.470" style="s2">know how they interact here so you got</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.170" end="00:12:12.440" style="s2">Osiris and the store there&#39;s variants of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.470" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">this story many but I&#39;m telling you like</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.440" end="00:12:20.900" style="s2">one sort of canonical variant so mmm</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:25.250" style="s2">story of Osiris and Isis and Horus yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.900" end="00:12:27.740" style="s2">yeah so and this is the story upon which</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.250" end="00:12:29.390" style="s2">Egyptian civilization was based although</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.740" end="00:12:31.960" style="s2">it was a very old civilization right</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.390" end="00:12:35.180" style="s2">lasted for thousands of years so</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.960" end="00:12:37.540" style="s2">Cleopatra there&#39;s less time from</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.180" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">Cleopatra to now than there is between</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.540" end="00:12:42.650" style="s2">Cleopatra and the pyramids so that kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:45.980" style="s2">of tells the whole old Egypt was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.650" end="00:12:48.530" style="s2">like old major civilization lasted a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.980" end="00:12:51.380" style="s2">long time had a powerful story a</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.530" end="00:12:54.860" style="s2">powerfully organizing story right way</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.380" end="00:12:57.620" style="s2">older than like then the history of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.860" end="00:13:00.140" style="s2">judeo-christian civilization say 2,000</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.620" end="00:13:03.320" style="s2">years older than Chinese history it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.140" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">old China goes back a long ways though</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.320" end="00:13:07.820" style="s2">so you know maybe it&#39;s not older than</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:13.990" style="s2">China but it&#39;s something anyway</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.820" end="00:13:16.640" style="s2">Oh Cyrus so Osiris was their God who</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.990" end="00:13:18.680" style="s2">established Egypt okay so he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.640" end="00:13:20.990" style="s2">George Washington if you had George</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.680" end="00:13:22.760" style="s2">Washington 2,000 years from now then</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.990" end="00:13:24.470" style="s2">George Washington would be Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.760" end="00:13:26.870" style="s2">because he&#39;d be mythologized</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.470" end="00:13:29.390" style="s2">right so basically Osiris represents all</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.870" end="00:13:32.060" style="s2">the good things that the Egyptians did</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.390" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">to establish order from chaos and set up</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.060" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">the society so Osiris he&#39;s a great he</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:38.390" style="s2">was a great hero when he was young and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:40.400" style="s2">he did all sorts of heroic things and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.390" end="00:13:43.900" style="s2">established the state of Egypt and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.400" end="00:13:46.550" style="s2">rules over it but he&#39;s kind of old and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.900" end="00:13:47.870" style="s2">you can&#39;t see as well as he used to and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.550" end="00:13:50.210" style="s2">he&#39;s little on the muddle-headed side</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.870" end="00:13:52.520" style="s2">but worse than that so he&#39;s archaic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.210" end="00:13:56.060" style="s2">anachronistic and so what that indicates</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.520" end="00:13:57.620" style="s2">is that well just like the Americans are</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.060" end="00:13:59.750" style="s2">experiencing with their Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.620" end="00:14:01.700" style="s2">it&#39;s like hmm things a little on the old</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.750" end="00:14:03.530" style="s2">side what should we do with it well we</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.700" end="00:14:05.150" style="s2">should update it&#39;s like well we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.530" end="00:14:06.950" style="s2">want to update it in a way that makes</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.150" end="00:14:10.100" style="s2">all chaos break forth you know so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.950" end="00:14:11.930" style="s2">anyways things get archaic just because</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.100" end="00:14:15.140" style="s2">they exist right so if you set up a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.930" end="00:14:16.730" style="s2">system of rules it&#39;s it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.140" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">adapt to this environment but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.730" end="00:14:20.150" style="s2">environment keeps wiggling around right</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:22.310" style="s2">so you have to chase it with the rules</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.150" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">and you have to update the rules as the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.310" end="00:14:25.880" style="s2">landscape changes and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:27.830" style="s2">biologists call that the Red Queen</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.880" end="00:14:30.260" style="s2">problem roughly speaking which is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.830" end="00:14:31.910" style="s2">reference to Ellis in Wonderland so</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.260" end="00:14:33.740" style="s2">Ellis goes down the rabbit hole and she</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.910" end="00:14:36.170" style="s2">finds the Red Queen that&#39;s the queen of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.740" end="00:14:37.550" style="s2">chaos mother nature and what and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.170" end="00:14:41.180" style="s2">always chopping people&#39;s heads off for</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.550" end="00:14:43.310" style="s2">arbitrary reasons like yeah and one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.180" end="00:14:44.930" style="s2">the things she tells alice&#39;s here in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.310" end="00:14:46.930" style="s2">kingdom you have to run as fast as you</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.930" end="00:14:49.400" style="s2">can just to stay in the same place and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.930" end="00:14:51.650" style="s2">that&#39;s the chronic human problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.400" end="00:14:54.260" style="s2">the problem of entropy right is that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.650" end="00:14:56.150" style="s2">build something static but things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.260" end="00:14:57.980" style="s2">static so even if it&#39;s a useful thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.150" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve built first of all you got to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.980" end="00:15:00.710" style="s2">maintain the hell out of it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:02.750" style="s2">just gonna fall apart but worse than</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.710" end="00:15:05.420" style="s2">that the environments running away from</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.750" end="00:15:07.070" style="s2">it and so your computers have Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.420" end="00:15:08.690" style="s2">problems all the time it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.070" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">just lovely for the first three years</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.690" end="00:15:12.620" style="s2">that you own them and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:14.870" style="s2">bricks and it&#39;s because the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.620" end="00:15:17.450" style="s2">landscape is so dynamic that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.870" end="00:15:19.130" style="s2">structure loses its validity</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.450" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">you could almost watch it lose its</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.130" end="00:15:21.560" style="s2">validity right as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:23.390" style="s2">ex</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.560" end="00:15:26.870" style="s2">financial increase in computer</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.390" end="00:15:30.710" style="s2">intelligence so Osiris great guy when he</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.870" end="00:15:34.490" style="s2">was young little old fashioned and worse</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.710" end="00:15:37.340" style="s2">he&#39;s willfully blind now the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.490" end="00:15:39.830" style="s2">insisted on that and that&#39;s so cool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.340" end="00:15:42.110" style="s2">actually you can be held responsible in</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.830" end="00:15:43.940" style="s2">an English common law cart court for</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.110" end="00:15:46.010" style="s2">willful blindness and what willful</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.940" end="00:15:47.300" style="s2">blindness is the fail is the failure to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.010" end="00:15:49.970" style="s2">realize something you could have</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.300" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">realized so for example if you&#39;re a CEO</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.970" end="00:15:55.820" style="s2">and you have a crooked chief financial</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:57.770" style="s2">officer and you think maybe he&#39;s crooked</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.820" end="00:16:00.890" style="s2">but you decide well I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.770" end="00:16:03.980" style="s2">look at the books because then I&#39;d know</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.890" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">and then his malfeasance is brought to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.980" end="00:16:08.180" style="s2">light and you say well I didn&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:10.700" style="s2">prosecutor will say yeah but you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.180" end="00:16:13.640" style="s2">have and you knew you could have and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.700" end="00:16:16.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t and so you&#39;re culpable for your</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.640" end="00:16:18.070" style="s2">own ignorance that&#39;s such a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.220" end="00:16:20.570" style="s2">idea the Egyptians figured this out</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.070" end="00:16:22.730" style="s2">Osiris is not only old and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.570" end="00:16:25.010" style="s2">decrepit and a little on the alzheimerís</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.730" end="00:16:26.390" style="s2">side but he won&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.010" end="00:16:29.270" style="s2">things he&#39;s had it with that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.390" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">willfully blind and that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.270" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">because he has a brother who was the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">evil brother of the rightful king which</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:37.010" style="s2">is a theme that you&#39;re all familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:39.410" style="s2">have you watched your Disney movies he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.010" end="00:16:41.990" style="s2">like scar in the Lion King right same</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.410" end="00:16:44.570" style="s2">guy or in Aladdin</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.990" end="00:16:47.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a some bad character I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.570" end="00:16:49.640" style="s2">remember his name lurk hmm that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.150" end="00:16:52.310" style="s2">guy yeah yeah so you know he&#39;s the he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.640" end="00:16:55.190" style="s2">the evil or Darth Vader in Star Wars</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.310" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s he&#39;s an archetypal figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.190" end="00:17:00.440" style="s2">he&#39;s the evil brother of the rightful</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.980" end="00:17:03.910" style="s2">king now why does the rightful king have</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.440" end="00:17:06.740" style="s2">an evil brother that&#39;s easy it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.910" end="00:17:08.959" style="s2">organizations tend towards decay and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.740" end="00:17:11.089" style="s2">corruption across time that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.959" end="00:17:12.980" style="s2">do the Socialists are really on this</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.089" end="00:17:15.350" style="s2">with regards to corporations right they</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.980" end="00:17:17.780" style="s2">evil corporations it&#39;s like and the and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.350" end="00:17:20.089" style="s2">the right-wingers think oh no it&#39;s evil</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.780" end="00:17:21.709" style="s2">government so they&#39;re just projecting</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.089" end="00:17:24.410" style="s2">the archetype of the negative farther</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.709" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">onto the respective organizations when</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.410" end="00:17:27.770" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s actually a characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:30.170" style="s2">of organizations they don&#39;t keep an eye</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.770" end="00:17:32.810" style="s2">on the damn things they degenerate and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.170" end="00:17:34.520" style="s2">they become corrupt so that&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.810" end="00:17:35.150" style="s2">happens you better stay awake to deal</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.520" end="00:17:37.940" style="s2">with that so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.150" end="00:17:40.700" style="s2">anyways Osiris has this evil brother</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.940" end="00:17:42.740" style="s2">named Seth and Seth the name Seth</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.700" end="00:17:45.530" style="s2">becomes Satan through the Coptic</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.740" end="00:17:47.540" style="s2">Christians much much much much later so</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.530" end="00:17:50.680" style="s2">he&#39;s like the precursor to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.540" end="00:17:53.660" style="s2">devil roughly speaking now</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.680" end="00:17:55.910" style="s2">Osiris think Seth is alright like like</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.660" end="00:17:58.220" style="s2">Skaar does or like Mufasa does with</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.910" end="00:18:01.370" style="s2">scart underestimates his danger</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.220" end="00:18:02.990" style="s2">something you should never do and so one</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.370" end="00:18:08.300" style="s2">day Osiris is just not paying much</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.990" end="00:18:09.980" style="s2">attention and Seth gets a big scimitar</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.300" end="00:18:13.430" style="s2">something like that chops him into</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.980" end="00:18:16.280" style="s2">pieces and then because you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.430" end="00:18:17.750" style="s2">kill Osiris because he&#39;s a god as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.280" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">as being the founder of the state and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.750" end="00:18:22.130" style="s2">the ruler the only thing you can do is</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:24.380" style="s2">make it difficult for him to get his act</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.130" end="00:18:26.900" style="s2">back together so what Seth does is he</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.380" end="00:18:29.180" style="s2">takes Osiris as pieces and he scatters</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.900" end="00:18:32.360" style="s2">them all over Egypt and the idea there</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.180" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">is that when corruption overtakes an</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.360" end="00:18:37.490" style="s2">organization then things fall apart but</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:38.780" style="s2">the things aren&#39;t actually dead you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.490" end="00:18:40.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like when it corporation falls</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.780" end="00:18:43.730" style="s2">apart all the people in it don&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.460" end="00:18:45.800" style="s2">they just fragment into maybe smaller</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.730" end="00:18:47.240" style="s2">groups some companies get spun off or</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.800" end="00:18:48.800" style="s2">maybe they fragment all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.240" end="00:18:51.500" style="s2">the individual level but there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.800" end="00:18:53.210" style="s2">potency left in it and the structure is</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.500" end="00:18:55.100" style="s2">still there inside each of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.210" end="00:18:57.020" style="s2">individuals in the sub organization so</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.100" end="00:18:58.460" style="s2">you can you can get the damn thing to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.020" end="00:19:00.980" style="s2">fall apart but you can&#39;t get rid of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.460" end="00:19:02.630" style="s2">so fight he does that he scatters these</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.980" end="00:19:06.200" style="s2">pieces everywhere so it makes it hard</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.630" end="00:19:08.510" style="s2">for Osiris to you know recollection or</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.200" end="00:19:10.310" style="s2">to get his act back together so things</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.510" end="00:19:12.380" style="s2">fall apart and it&#39;s hard for you to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.310" end="00:19:15.130" style="s2">your out back together that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.380" end="00:19:17.510" style="s2">and so and then he rules the kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.130" end="00:19:19.160" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t work out very well just</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.510" end="00:19:22.070" style="s2">like Skaar and The Lion King right</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.160" end="00:19:24.050" style="s2">because he&#39;s an evil tyrant and all</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.070" end="00:19:27.100" style="s2">things considered evil tyranny doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.050" end="00:19:29.270" style="s2">work that well even for the evil tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.100" end="00:19:31.160" style="s2">although you should never assume that an</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.270" end="00:19:39.080" style="s2">evil tyrant wants things to work well</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.160" end="00:19:42.440" style="s2">not even for him so anyways fine Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.080" end="00:19:45.020" style="s2">has a wife Isis now Isis she&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.440" end="00:19:47.030" style="s2">league player in ancient mythology Isis</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.020" end="00:19:48.620" style="s2">is queen of the underworld and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.030" end="00:19:51.470" style="s2">real toss-up if you look at our case</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.620" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">cultures whether the top god is the guy</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.470" end="00:19:55.640" style="s2">or the order guy like Osiris or the top</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.990" end="00:19:59.180" style="s2">god is Isis who&#39;s Queen in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.640" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">underworld it&#39;s like it&#39;s 50/50 for sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.180" end="00:20:04.160" style="s2">and while Isis represents chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">Osiris represents order and they should</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.160" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">be in ballots like you know if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:09.559" style="s2">in harmonious balance like app su and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:12.260" style="s2">Tiamat then they produce all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.559" end="00:20:13.820" style="s2">productive things and if one overwhelms</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.260" end="00:20:17.150" style="s2">the other well then it&#39;s not so good so</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.820" end="00:20:18.830" style="s2">they should be a harmonious couple okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.150" end="00:20:20.300" style="s2">but now our cyrus is dead</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.830" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">wack he&#39;s chopped up and spread</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.300" end="00:20:24.500" style="s2">everywhere so op Isis comes out of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:28.520" style="s2">underworld well that&#39;s what happened</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.500" end="00:20:31.429" style="s2">when the Americans invaded Iraq it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.520" end="00:20:33.470" style="s2">like well Osiris is gone yeah but what</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.429" end="00:20:34.790" style="s2">about Isis oh we forgot about Isis up</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.470" end="00:20:37.370" style="s2">she comes chaos</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.790" end="00:20:43.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like there it is so and is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.370" end="00:20:45.080" style="s2">better not obviously so you never want</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.880" end="00:20:47.900" style="s2">to forget about Isis</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.080" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">so anyways Isis she&#39;s not that happy</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.900" end="00:20:51.260" style="s2">that Osiris is gone because that&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">husband right and she thinks well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.260" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">not so so helpful so what she does is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.260" end="00:20:59.929" style="s2">she runs around Egypt trying to find his</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:02.450" style="s2">fellows and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.929" end="00:21:05.150" style="s2">because it it&#39;s the seminal apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.450" end="00:21:07.010" style="s2">right it&#39;s the seed of the new thing so</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.150" end="00:21:08.450" style="s2">what she does is she finds his phallus</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.010" end="00:21:10.670" style="s2">and she makes herself pregnant with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.450" end="00:21:12.770" style="s2">and so bang she goes back down to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.670" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">underworld but now she&#39;s impregnated so</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.770" end="00:21:17.800" style="s2">what does that mean it means when</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:20.270" style="s2">remarkable things fall apart into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.800" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">the seeds of something new are</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.270" end="00:21:26.270" style="s2">potentially planted okay so fine she</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:28.540" style="s2">gives birth to Horus like Arthur he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.270" end="00:21:31.970" style="s2">outside his rightful kingdom just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.540" end="00:21:34.340" style="s2">Simba it&#39;s a standard routine just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.970" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">Harry Potter right he&#39;s outside his</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.340" end="00:21:36.860" style="s2">kingdom and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:38.990" style="s2">you&#39;re all outside your kingdom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.860" end="00:21:40.280" style="s2">like the kingdom is sort of old and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.990" end="00:21:41.809" style="s2">archaic and doesn&#39;t quite fit the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.280" end="00:21:43.550" style="s2">circumstances now and it&#39;s not all that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.809" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">fair to you and it&#39;s sort of arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.550" end="00:21:48.110" style="s2">and so you grow up to some degree an</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:51.920" style="s2">underworld in opposition to it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:53.900" style="s2">just an archetypal story so this this</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.920" end="00:21:55.700" style="s2">character she finally gives birth to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.900" end="00:21:57.980" style="s2">this character and that&#39;s Osiris and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.700" end="00:22:00.650" style="s2">Osiris he&#39;s he&#39;s quite the character</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.980" end="00:22:01.910" style="s2">he&#39;s that so sorry that&#39;s all sorry his</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.650" end="00:22:04.940" style="s2">name is Horace and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.910" end="00:22:06.980" style="s2">Taurus there and she&#39;s the benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.940" end="00:22:08.360" style="s2">goddess of all new things as well as</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.980" end="00:22:11.000" style="s2">being the terrible goddess of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.360" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">underworld and she knows she&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.000" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">up Horus and Horus where is he here</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.060" end="00:22:23.270" style="s2">there he is</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">so Horus is this is Falken because he</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.270" end="00:22:26.780" style="s2">can fly around and see everything and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:29.210" style="s2">he&#39;s also the eye of the Egyptians and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.780" end="00:22:32.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s like he&#39;s like mardik he&#39;s eyes</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.210" end="00:22:34.580" style="s2">he can see okay so then Horus grows up</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.390" end="00:22:37.130" style="s2">and he&#39;s thinking hah</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.580" end="00:22:39.770" style="s2">not finder world stuff I&#39;d like to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.130" end="00:22:41.630" style="s2">my kingdom back my rightful Kingdom now</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.770" end="00:22:42.920" style="s2">he&#39;s different than Osiris and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.630" end="00:22:46.070" style="s2">reason he&#39;s different is because he can</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.920" end="00:22:48.050" style="s2">see and normally can he see he will see</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.070" end="00:22:50.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s a whole different thing so</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.050" end="00:22:51.860" style="s2">Horus is not willfully blind and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.360" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">a drag because he can see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.860" end="00:22:55.730" style="s2">happened to the kingdom and he can see</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">Seth and that&#39;s not so good it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.730" end="00:23:00.590" style="s2">you&#39;re in in romeo Dallaire z&#39; position</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">then aren&#39;t you you have to shake hands</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.590" end="00:23:03.650" style="s2">with the devil and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:06.670" style="s2">happened to romeo Dallaire when that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.650" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">happened it&#39;s like post-trip</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.670" end="00:23:11.450" style="s2">you know he was there in Rwanda when</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:13.490" style="s2">everybody got massacred and the UN</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.450" end="00:23:15.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t step in property had to watch all</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.490" end="00:23:18.560" style="s2">that it was like post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.680" end="00:23:20.450" style="s2">disorder instantly so it&#39;s like if your</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.560" end="00:23:23.150" style="s2">eyes open and you can see evil it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.450" end="00:23:25.220" style="s2">you better look out because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.150" end="00:23:27.080" style="s2">face to face with real malevolence the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.220" end="00:23:29.870" style="s2">probability that that will damage your</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.080" end="00:23:31.370" style="s2">brain is very high you know and one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.870" end="00:23:32.750" style="s2">the things that&#39;s very interesting if</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.370" end="00:23:35.480" style="s2">you think about post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.750" end="00:23:37.310" style="s2">disorder is that often in soldiers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.480" end="00:23:40.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a consequence of something</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.310" end="00:23:41.960" style="s2">they did not something they saw so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.520" end="00:23:43.010" style="s2">they&#39;ll go out in the battlefield and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.960" end="00:23:45.110" style="s2">they&#39;ll find out they&#39;re far more</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">barbarous and cruel and destructive than</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.110" end="00:23:49.220" style="s2">they ever possibly imagined and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:52.130" style="s2">they how are they going to fit that into</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.220" end="00:23:54.020" style="s2">like corn-fed farm boy from Iowa scheme</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.130" end="00:23:56.390" style="s2">you know they can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.020" end="00:23:58.430" style="s2">poof the whole structure is gone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.390" end="00:24:00.110" style="s2">very stressful to find that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.430" end="00:24:03.500" style="s2">thing out and the people I&#39;ve had in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.110" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">practice who have had PTSD it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.500" end="00:24:08.360" style="s2">always because they were subjected to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:10.520" style="s2">some kind of malevolence like it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.360" end="00:24:12.560" style="s2">they they came face-to-face with</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.520" end="00:24:15.140" style="s2">something evil and in one case for</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.560" end="00:24:15.720" style="s2">example I had a client whose boyfriend</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.140" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">was going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.720" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">raper she was naive beyond belief and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:23.909" style="s2">what what gave her post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:25.049" style="s2">disorder wasn&#39;t what he did because she</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.909" end="00:24:27.720" style="s2">could fight him off she happened to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.049" end="00:24:30.059" style="s2">bigger than he was it was the look of</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.720" end="00:24:32.490" style="s2">malevolence on his face when he attacked</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.059" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">her that was enough and it she had</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.490" end="00:24:37.049" style="s2">severe psychosomatic syndrome symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">for four years after that she couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.049" end="00:24:42.030" style="s2">even sleep her whole body would vibrate</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:44.190" style="s2">and it took a lot of untangling before</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.030" end="00:24:46.350" style="s2">we figured out that it was the look on</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.190" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">his face and I&#39;ve seen that happen other</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.350" end="00:24:51.659" style="s2">times it&#39;s like becoming face to face</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">with this sort of thing is no joke so</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.659" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">Horace can see but luckily he&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">ways from it yep yes I could imagine hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.809" end="00:25:31.230" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s an at a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:32.669" style="s2">to put the chaos back in a net one thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.230" end="00:25:34.470" style="s2">you might want to know about Hitler is</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.669" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">that one day in World War one he&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.470" end="00:25:38.070" style="s2">got a medal for bravery in World War one</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:39.480" style="s2">by the way so Hitler was all sitting</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.070" end="00:25:41.190" style="s2">around with his buddies in a trench and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.480" end="00:25:42.929" style="s2">he went off to relieve himself and when</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.190" end="00:25:44.250" style="s2">he came back they were all dead because</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.929" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">a shell had landed right in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.250" end="00:25:48.690" style="s2">and so that gave him the idea that he</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:50.220" style="s2">was saved for something special and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.690" end="00:25:51.690" style="s2">can tell you if that happened to you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.220" end="00:25:52.230" style="s2">would feel because we&#39;re using your</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.690" end="00:25:54.210" style="s2">options</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.230" end="00:25:55.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a horrible chaotic nasty place</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.210" end="00:25:58.860" style="s2">where brutal things happen at random</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.500" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">that&#39;s one option or you were saved</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.860" end="00:26:03.630" style="s2">because something special is waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:04.830" style="s2">you so like to toss up which of those</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.630" end="00:26:08.610" style="s2">two you&#39;re gonna pick but you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.830" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">pick one of them so anyways okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.610" end="00:26:14.700" style="s2">Horace he can see set too bad for him so</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:16.950" style="s2">he goes back to the kingdom and he has</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.700" end="00:26:18.809" style="s2">like vicious fight with set and sets</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.950" end="00:26:20.820" style="s2">like they&#39;re pretty evenly matched and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.809" end="00:26:24.210" style="s2">so the idea there is that even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.820" end="00:26:27.059" style="s2">Oris like son of the of order and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.210" end="00:26:28.110" style="s2">son of chaos and your eyes are open it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.059" end="00:26:30.360" style="s2">like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.110" end="00:26:33.000" style="s2">evil it&#39;s a pretty even battle so</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.360" end="00:26:34.470" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting away and Seth gets the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.000" end="00:26:37.590" style="s2">upper hand and he tears out one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.470" end="00:26:39.330" style="s2">Horace&#39;s eyes and then Horace which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.590" end="00:26:42.510" style="s2">pretty damaging you know that&#39;s a drag</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.330" end="00:26:45.090" style="s2">to lose an eye so his vision is damaged</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.510" end="00:26:46.380" style="s2">by his encounter with evil but Horace</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.090" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">keeps fighting and eventually he</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.380" end="00:26:51.000" style="s2">prevails and he gets the eye back and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:52.440" style="s2">banishes Seth to the nether regions of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.000" end="00:26:53.880" style="s2">the kingdom it&#39;s like in the Lion King</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.440" end="00:26:55.860" style="s2">where you know everything the light</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.880" end="00:26:57.690" style="s2">touches is the kingdom and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.860" end="00:26:59.610" style="s2">the nether regions that&#39;s where you send</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.690" end="00:27:02.130" style="s2">a little Seth so you can&#39;t be rid of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.610" end="00:27:05.789" style="s2">them can&#39;t kill him he&#39;s permanent</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.130" end="00:27:07.889" style="s2">because society&#39;s will always tend</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.789" end="00:27:09.570" style="s2">towards corruption the best you can do</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.889" end="00:27:12.330" style="s2">is get the damn guy under control for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.570" end="00:27:13.740" style="s2">while okay so now Horace has his eye and</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.330" end="00:27:15.510" style="s2">you think end of story</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.740" end="00:27:17.340" style="s2">pretty good story you could animate that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.510" end="00:27:19.590" style="s2">he just slapped the old eye back in his</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.340" end="00:27:22.529" style="s2">head you know pick up the sceptre and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.590" end="00:27:26.279" style="s2">he&#39;d rule happily ever after that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.529" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">what happens what happens instead is he</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.279" end="00:27:31.230" style="s2">pinkie keeps his eye and he goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:32.549" style="s2">the underworld and he finds Osiris as</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.230" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">ghost down there and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.549" end="00:27:35.669" style="s2">sitting there like this you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:37.799" style="s2">because it&#39;s all chopped up innit you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.669" end="00:27:41.490" style="s2">know it&#39;s a weird combination because on</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.799" end="00:27:43.289" style="s2">in one plane it&#39;s it&#39;s a chopped-up body</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.490" end="00:27:44.850" style="s2">that&#39;s distributed everywhere but down</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.289" end="00:27:47.490" style="s2">in the underworld it&#39;s like a ghost a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.850" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">spirit but it&#39;s not very animated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.490" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">sort of in the land of the dead like</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:56.820" style="s2">Pinocchio&#39;s farther in the whale so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:28:01.769" style="s2">is this whole Horace do well he he gives</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.820" end="00:28:04.740" style="s2">Osiris his eye so now blind tradition</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.769" end="00:28:06.870" style="s2">can see and then he takes his father</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.740" end="00:28:08.909" style="s2">Osiris back up to the surface sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.870" end="00:28:11.370" style="s2">now they&#39;re a unit arm-in-arm so to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.909" end="00:28:13.380" style="s2">speak and it&#39;s the commits the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.370" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">combination of Horace and Osiris that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.380" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">rule Egypt and that&#39;s what the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:20.429" style="s2">figured out it&#39;s like god that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:22.919" style="s2">smart it&#39;s like well you need this you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.429" end="00:28:25.320" style="s2">need the traditions of the state right</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.919" end="00:28:28.019" style="s2">because you need them there if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.320" end="00:28:30.200" style="s2">they&#39;re vital they hold back chaos you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.019" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">can&#39;t just let that go because then</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.200" end="00:28:35.490" style="s2">income seth and up comes the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:38.490" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s not good you need that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.490" end="00:28:40.260" style="s2">as a bulwark but then it&#39;s old and kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.490" end="00:28:41.890" style="s2">of blind and it&#39;s gonna tend towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.260" end="00:28:44.290" style="s2">corruption and fall over of its own</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.890" end="00:28:48.310" style="s2">Kord so how do you solve that and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.290" end="00:28:51.580" style="s2">answer is you pay attention and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.310" end="00:28:54.220" style="s2">provide dead tradition with living sight</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.580" end="00:28:56.170" style="s2">and if you do that then you get to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.220" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">the ruler of the state the rightful</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.170" end="00:29:00.340" style="s2">ruler of the state</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:03.070" style="s2">now the Egyptians basically hypothesized</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.340" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">this took a long time that the Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.070" end="00:29:07.510" style="s2">also had an immortal soul he was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:09.610" style="s2">only person who did but the immortal</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.510" end="00:29:13.350" style="s2">soul was basically the combination of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:15.070" style="s2">Horace and Osiris so the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.350" end="00:29:18.550" style="s2">conceptualized that is something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.070" end="00:29:21.700" style="s2">was eternal so and it was the it was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.550" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">eternal it was the central eternal</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.700" end="00:29:28.090" style="s2">feature of sovereignty it&#39;s so smart and</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:30.790" style="s2">so as long as the Pharaoh was a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.090" end="00:29:33.160" style="s2">Horace and Osiris at the same time then</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.790" end="00:29:35.590" style="s2">he was the rightful sovereign and he was</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.160" end="00:29:39.750" style="s2">reflecting something of the utmost value</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.590" end="00:29:42.550" style="s2">and it was immortal it&#39;s so smart so</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.750" end="00:29:44.740" style="s2">what happened so interestingly they call</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.550" end="00:29:48.010" style="s2">this the democratization of Osiris so to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.740" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">begin with in the Egyptian state you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.010" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">could only use the Horus Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:54.520" style="s2">symbolism if you were either the Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:57.180" style="s2">to begin with or at least a high-ranking</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.520" end="00:29:59.590" style="s2">aristocrat but what happened as Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.180" end="00:30:02.140" style="s2">progressed so to speak as it developed</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.590" end="00:30:06.220" style="s2">across time is that the right to use the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.140" end="00:30:08.680" style="s2">symbolism that that was the Horus Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.220" end="00:30:11.620" style="s2">conjunction drifted down the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.680" end="00:30:13.660" style="s2">hierarchy so at some point all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.620" end="00:30:16.150" style="s2">aristocrats got to use it never drifted</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.660" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">down to like women or common people or</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.150" end="00:30:21.880" style="s2">slaves or anything like that but you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:23.410" style="s2">know hypothetically the Jews came out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.880" end="00:30:26.860" style="s2">Egypt and one of the things the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.410" end="00:30:33.580" style="s2">said that went beyond the Egyptians was</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.860" end="00:30:35.530" style="s2">that each person was was capable was in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.580" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">noble din some sense by their potential</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.530" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">relationship with the highest value that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:40.950" style="s2">was gone and when the Christians showed</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:43.780" style="s2">up but that was universalized</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.950" end="00:30:46.270" style="s2">everyone had it even prostitutes and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.780" end="00:30:49.210" style="s2">slaves so it&#39;s so cool because what</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.270" end="00:30:52.360" style="s2">happens is these societies get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.210" end="00:30:55.510" style="s2">of sovereignty laid out in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.360" end="00:30:57.250" style="s2">phenomenal heavenly drama</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.510" end="00:30:58.840" style="s2">and they identify that with the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.250" end="00:30:59.740" style="s2">that&#39;s at the top of the hierarchy which</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.740" end="00:31:03.130" style="s2">but then what happens across time is</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.690" end="00:31:04.750" style="s2">everybody wakes up and thinks oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.130" end="00:31:07.450" style="s2">so interesting it&#39;s characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.750" end="00:31:09.580" style="s2">the Pharaoh its characteristic of what</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.580" end="00:31:13.900" style="s2">of what the highest value is but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.010" end="00:31:17.140" style="s2">actually characteristic of everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.900" end="00:31:19.270" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s almost impossible to overstate</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.140" end="00:31:22.750" style="s2">how important that is because our whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.270" end="00:31:25.000" style="s2">conception of the idea of natural rights</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.750" end="00:31:27.520" style="s2">is predicated on the idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.000" end="00:31:32.950" style="s2">something about you as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.520" end="00:31:34.120" style="s2">individual whose value is inviolable so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.950" end="00:31:37.690" style="s2">much that it doesn&#39;t even matter what</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.120" end="00:31:40.210" style="s2">you do so if I see you brutally murder</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.690" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">20 people and there&#39;s 50 eyewitnesses</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.210" end="00:31:45.280" style="s2">and we know for sure you did it you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">still have to be treated as if your</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.280" end="00:31:51.160" style="s2">central essence is of tremendous value</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:54.220" style="s2">and you have to be given due process the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.160" end="00:31:55.750" style="s2">whole law bow down before that and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.220" end="00:31:57.700" style="s2">then you think well do people believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.750" end="00:32:00.190" style="s2">this this sort of Horus</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.700" end="00:32:03.190" style="s2">Osiris combination and its relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.190" end="00:32:04.780" style="s2">to what&#39;s ultimately valuable and the</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.780" end="00:32:08.830" style="s2">person it&#39;s like they certainly act like</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.790" end="00:32:11.020" style="s2">they believe it and if if they ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.830" end="00:32:13.180" style="s2">encounter a violation of that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.020" end="00:32:14.980" style="s2">practice especially social practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.180" end="00:32:16.570" style="s2">everybody&#39;s jumping up and down and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.980" end="00:32:17.620" style="s2">complaining it&#39;s like you&#39;re trampling</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.570" end="00:32:19.750" style="s2">on my rights</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.620" end="00:32:22.150" style="s2">what do you mean where&#39;d those come from</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.750" end="00:32:27.610" style="s2">what exactly what are they and are they</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.150" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">real or not and if they&#39;re not real well</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.610" end="00:32:32.620" style="s2">then I can trample over them all I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:34.420" style="s2">because they&#39;re not real but if they and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.620" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">then we can just have an argument about</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.420" end="00:32:39.250" style="s2">what human beings are like but if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:41.080" style="s2">are real and they&#39;re reflective of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.250" end="00:32:43.540" style="s2">underlying principle that&#39;s continually</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.080" end="00:32:45.850" style="s2">attempting to manifest itself in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.540" end="00:32:47.710" style="s2">from the bottom up you better not break</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.850" end="00:32:50.860" style="s2">the rules because you&#39;re really going</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.710" end="00:32:53.290" style="s2">against the cosmic order so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.860" end="00:32:55.330" style="s2">Egyptian story it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.290" end="00:32:57.670" style="s2">mind-boggling it&#39;s no wonder that story</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.330" end="00:32:59.260" style="s2">had enough dynamism to to propel a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.670" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">culture across several thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.260" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a staggering achievement</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.140" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a really good that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.700" end="00:33:27.289" style="s2">really good observation this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:28.760" style="s2">the things that I I really that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.289" end="00:33:30.190" style="s2">something new that I&#39;ve figured out</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.760" end="00:33:33.710" style="s2">about all of this in the last five years</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.190" end="00:33:35.960" style="s2">for a long time and I still haven&#39;t got</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.710" end="00:33:38.570" style="s2">this right it&#39;s like okay what is your</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.960" end="00:33:40.309" style="s2">reaction when one of those principles is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.570" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">violated so this is like the terror</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.309" end="00:33:45.530" style="s2">management question right well for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:46.760" style="s2">terror management people it&#39;s fear but</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.530" end="00:33:48.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a real problem with that because</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.760" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">conservatives tend to be less neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.740" end="00:33:53.299" style="s2">than liberals and conservatives who have</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:55.070" style="s2">more of a propensity for right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.299" end="00:33:57.380" style="s2">authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.070" end="00:33:59.900" style="s2">are more likely to get upset when rules</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.380" end="00:34:01.850" style="s2">are violated but the rules seem to be so</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.900" end="00:34:04.010" style="s2">I think it&#39;s more or I thought that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.850" end="00:34:06.409" style="s2">was more no no it&#39;s not exactly if your</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.010" end="00:34:08.690" style="s2">rules get violated it&#39;s not exactly fear</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.409" end="00:34:10.940" style="s2">although fears part of it it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.690" end="00:34:13.940" style="s2">disintegration of your motivational</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.940" end="00:34:15.320" style="s2">States into general preparation for for</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.940" end="00:34:17.419" style="s2">readiness so that&#39;s more like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.320" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">generalized stress response and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.419" end="00:34:21.230" style="s2">everything goes on so that you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:24.109" style="s2">to deal with what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.230" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like Gottman&#39;s married couples when</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.109" end="00:34:27.830" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that are gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:29.480" style="s2">divorced right they&#39;re very calm on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.830" end="00:34:32.030" style="s2">surface but underneath it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.480" end="00:34:33.349" style="s2">underworld all hell is broke loose but</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.030" end="00:34:35.419" style="s2">then there&#39;s been a twist in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.349" end="00:34:37.099" style="s2">because there&#39;s a bunch of data coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.419" end="00:34:39.849" style="s2">together from all over the world that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.099" end="00:34:42.500" style="s2">basically goes like this is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.849" end="00:34:46.099" style="s2">right-wing authoritarianism seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.500" end="00:34:48.980" style="s2">based on purity and purity is disgust</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.099" end="00:34:51.139" style="s2">control and there&#39;s a deep biological</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.980" end="00:34:53.990" style="s2">root root for that like people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.139" end="00:34:56.300" style="s2">disgust sensitive and concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.990" end="00:34:58.550" style="s2">purity have better standards of hygiene</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.300" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">and they do tend to live longer but</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.550" end="00:35:03.020" style="s2">they&#39;re also very much against temper</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:05.660" style="s2">mentally against any form of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.020" end="00:35:08.109" style="s2">contact it isn&#39;t bounded by the social</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.660" end="00:35:10.550" style="s2">contract and they don&#39;t like foreigners</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.109" end="00:35:13.310" style="s2">but that&#39;s all a clump it&#39;s all the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.550" end="00:35:15.500" style="s2">thing and then we&#39;ve found recently we</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.310" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t published this yet we&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.500" end="00:35:18.920" style="s2">recently that we know</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:21.250" style="s2">conservatives are more conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.920" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2">than liberals and then we found that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.250" end="00:35:24.890" style="s2">conscientiousness fragments into</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.150" end="00:35:26.810" style="s2">industriousness and orderliness which</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.890" end="00:35:29.030" style="s2">was great because people have been</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:30.530" style="s2">wondering for five decades how you plug</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.030" end="00:35:32.420" style="s2">that proclivity for right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.530" end="00:35:34.099" style="s2">authoritarianism into the general</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.420" end="00:35:35.780" style="s2">personality structure and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.099" end="00:35:39.319" style="s2">complicated because if you&#39;re a radical</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.780" end="00:35:41.210" style="s2">liberal like a radical lefty that those</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.319" end="00:35:43.010" style="s2">aren&#39;t liberals sorry radical lefty a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.210" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">communist you could be just it seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.010" end="00:35:46.460" style="s2">like you could be just as authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:48.950" style="s2">as you would be if you were a fascist so</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.460" end="00:35:52.369" style="s2">you know that hasn&#39;t been quite sorted</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.950" end="00:35:54.440" style="s2">out yet but it&#39;s the orderliness that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.369" end="00:35:56.210" style="s2">seems to make people have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.440" end="00:35:57.290" style="s2">right-wing proclivity and it does look</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.210" end="00:36:01.819" style="s2">like what they&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.290" end="00:36:04.520" style="s2">control disgust so yes what what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.819" end="00:36:06.910" style="s2">violation of that order a huge chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.520" end="00:36:10.280" style="s2">it seems to be in this entirely new</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.910" end="00:36:12.260" style="s2">negative emotion system that we&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.280" end="00:36:15.130" style="s2">been untangling for twenty years and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.260" end="00:36:17.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not associated with neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.130" end="00:36:19.130" style="s2">liberals are actually more neurotic than</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.150" end="00:36:20.329" style="s2">conservatives you know and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.130" end="00:36:22.609" style="s2">well that&#39;s because the Conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.329" end="00:36:25.670" style="s2">are so well protected it&#39;s like no no</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.609" end="00:36:27.020" style="s2">you can&#39;t post-hoc use your theory to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.670" end="00:36:28.579" style="s2">predict the opposite of what you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.020" end="00:36:30.619" style="s2">have predicted before the data comes in</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.579" end="00:36:32.569" style="s2">it&#39;s like no conservatives are they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.619" end="00:36:34.220" style="s2">should be more physiologically reactive</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.569" end="00:36:36.950" style="s2">and there&#39;s some evidence that they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.220" end="00:36:41.030" style="s2">but it does really seem to be discussed</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.950" end="00:36:44.300" style="s2">and so to jump ahead a little bit when</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.030" end="00:36:45.770" style="s2">after we&#39;d sorted this out know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.300" end="00:36:47.480" style="s2">the work that was done on disgust was</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.770" end="00:36:49.460" style="s2">done by Jonathan hey he&#39;s the guy that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.480" end="00:36:51.349" style="s2">deserves the credit for the disgust</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.460" end="00:36:53.630" style="s2">purity linkage it&#39;s a big deal and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.349" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">was pushing the Study of disgust long</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.630" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">before people were paying any attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">to it so good for him when I was working</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:02.930" style="s2">on the orderliness disgust relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:05.720" style="s2">I was also reading this book by Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.930" end="00:37:08.630" style="s2">called Hitler&#39;s Table Talk and what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.720" end="00:37:11.270" style="s2">was was a he would talk at his dinners</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.630" end="00:37:13.640" style="s2">and they collected it from 1939 to 1940</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.270" end="00:37:15.380" style="s2">- and he would like just spout off on</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.640" end="00:37:17.089" style="s2">whatever it was that was on his mind and</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.089" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">lateral discussion he was very</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.680" end="00:37:23.720" style="s2">interested in art and culture but he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:26.210" style="s2">very very orderly and he was a worshiper</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.720" end="00:37:29.210" style="s2">of willpower and orderly people are like</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.210" end="00:37:31.130" style="s2">that like anorexics are orderly -</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.210" end="00:37:33.289" style="s2">orderly they can&#39;t even stand their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.130" end="00:37:35.630" style="s2">it&#39;s discussed that their bodies elicit</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.289" end="00:37:37.940" style="s2">and they prize the ability to control</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.630" end="00:37:39.710" style="s2">their bodies and that&#39;s hyper</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.940" end="00:37:41.690" style="s2">orderliness that&#39;s I think why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.710" end="00:37:45.410" style="s2">associated it&#39;s generally considered an</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.690" end="00:37:46.849" style="s2">upper-middle-class disease and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.410" end="00:37:49.069" style="s2">that&#39;s because a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.849" end="00:37:50.420" style="s2">at that strata are hyper conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.069" end="00:37:51.799" style="s2">and that gets passed on to their kids</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.420" end="00:37:55.640" style="s2">and sometimes that&#39;s just too much</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.799" end="00:37:58.220" style="s2">anyways one of the things that really</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.640" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">struck me about Hitler&#39;s writings and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.220" end="00:38:03.289" style="s2">really it really blew me away I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:05.059" style="s2">you was that he has a metaphor all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.289" end="00:38:08.390" style="s2">his thinking&#39;s metaphorical and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.059" end="00:38:13.309" style="s2">metaphor is the Aryan race is a pure</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.390" end="00:38:17.269" style="s2">body pure blood pure uncontaminated and</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.309" end="00:38:19.519" style="s2">it&#39;s under assault by pathogens and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.269" end="00:38:21.589" style="s2">parasites now as soon as you know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.519" end="00:38:25.249" style="s2">bang you&#39;ve got is you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.589" end="00:38:29.029" style="s2">underlying dynamic of of his appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.249" end="00:38:31.940" style="s2">the masses and Germans hey they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.029" end="00:38:34.309" style="s2">orderly so you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.940" end="00:38:36.859" style="s2">people say is that what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.309" end="00:38:39.079" style="s2">Germany constituted the decline of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.859" end="00:38:43.460" style="s2">civilization right back to barbarism</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.079" end="00:38:45.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like ah maybe not conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.460" end="00:38:47.210" style="s2">is associated with productivity quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.559" end="00:38:49.249" style="s2">highly correlations about point four</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.210" end="00:38:51.710" style="s2">roughly the same as the correlation with</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.249" end="00:38:53.930" style="s2">IQ so conscientiousness is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.710" end="00:38:55.369" style="s2">prerequisite for civilization and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.930" end="00:38:57.469" style="s2">can think well why would you be</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.369" end="00:38:59.150" style="s2">discussed sensitive and orderly and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.469" end="00:39:01.180" style="s2">answer might be well how much of your</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.150" end="00:39:03.469" style="s2">grain do you want rats and mice to eat</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.180" end="00:39:04.789" style="s2">because they eat lots of it right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.469" end="00:39:06.769" style="s2">keeping the insects out of the food</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.789" end="00:39:08.630" style="s2">store that&#39;s really really hard so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.769" end="00:39:09.619" style="s2">you&#39;re going to store things up which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.630" end="00:39:11.630" style="s2">what you&#39;re going to do if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.619" end="00:39:13.940" style="s2">to be civilized you better start to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.630" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">concerned with hygiene you know so those</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.940" end="00:39:18.559" style="s2">things are going to go together well</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:21.109" style="s2">Hitler was hyper orderly and hyper</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.559" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">discuss sensitive he washes he bathed</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.109" end="00:39:27.979" style="s2">four times a day and he was very very</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:29.960" style="s2">happy about the ability to stand in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.979" end="00:39:32.119" style="s2">back of his car his parade car and keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.960" end="00:39:33.650" style="s2">his arm out like this for eight hours he</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.119" end="00:39:34.009" style="s2">thought of that as the triumph of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.650" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.009" end="00:39:38.180" style="s2">you know when the will seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:40.279" style="s2">associated with this propensity towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.180" end="00:39:42.499" style="s2">orderliness so another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.279" end="00:39:44.029" style="s2">really interesting and and I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.499" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">exactly know what to make of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.029" end="00:39:46.550" style="s2">because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:48.590" style="s2">has complicated my conceptualizations</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.550" end="00:39:52.040" style="s2">because a lot of what I&#39;m going to show</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.590" end="00:39:54.470" style="s2">you is based on fear and horror and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.040" end="00:39:55.910" style="s2">horror is more like fear plus disgust</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.470" end="00:39:57.950" style="s2">it&#39;s something you know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.910" end="00:39:59.900" style="s2">between the Blair Witch Project and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.950" end="00:40:02.150" style="s2">chick Texas Chainsaw Massacre</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.900" end="00:40:03.619" style="s2">they&#39;re both horror movies but one is</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.150" end="00:40:07.400" style="s2">pure fear and the other is almost pure</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.619" end="00:40:09.140" style="s2">discussed so disgust seems to be a huge</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.400" end="00:40:11.060" style="s2">element of this and it is a primary</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.140" end="00:40:13.609" style="s2">response by orderly people to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.060" end="00:40:15.710" style="s2">violation of moral norms now here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.609" end="00:40:18.710" style="s2">something weird there was a paper</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.710" end="00:40:24.260" style="s2">published in PLoS ONE about a year ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.710" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">and what these people did was they they</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.260" end="00:40:31.010" style="s2">did I think a within and a cross-country</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:35.210" style="s2">survey and this wasn&#39;t in developed</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.010" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">countries so the question was how much</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.210" end="00:40:40.790" style="s2">infectious disease was there in each of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:43.880" style="s2">these geographical locales and the next</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.790" end="00:40:47.060" style="s2">question was how right-wing were the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.880" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">people who occupied those areas at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.060" end="00:40:49.970" style="s2">individual level so they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">interested in what the government was</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.970" end="00:40:53.869" style="s2">like and what they found was that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">correlation between the prevalence of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.869" end="00:40:58.760" style="s2">infectious diseases and right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:02.359" style="s2">authoritarianism at the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.760" end="00:41:03.830" style="s2">was point six it&#39;s like and if you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.359" end="00:41:05.420" style="s2">anything about statistics when you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.830" end="00:41:07.010" style="s2">point six you just fall over and</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.420" end="00:41:10.130" style="s2">hyperventilate because that never</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.010" end="00:41:12.859" style="s2">happens it&#39;s an effect size that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.130" end="00:41:14.270" style="s2">bigger than 99% of the effect sizes that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.859" end="00:41:19.640" style="s2">you&#39;d ever encounter in the social</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.270" end="00:41:21.320" style="s2">sciences it might be 99.9 percent higher</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.640" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">the infectious disease rate the more</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.320" end="00:41:26.510" style="s2">right-wing totalitarian the population</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:28.790" style="s2">why well why do you think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.510" end="00:41:31.300" style="s2">regulating inter personal contact and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.790" end="00:41:34.369" style="s2">sexual behavior why well think about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.300" end="00:41:35.810" style="s2">you know they&#39;re trying to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.369" end="00:41:38.210" style="s2">disease transmission vectors</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.810" end="00:41:39.980" style="s2">fundamentally now they&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.210" end="00:41:43.850" style="s2">do that you know what I mean it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.980" end="00:41:47.020" style="s2">adaptation keep yourself out of contact</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.850" end="00:41:47.020" style="s2">keep yourself isolated</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.610" end="00:41:55.510" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.260" end="00:41:57.220" style="s2">know because lots of those places there</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.510" end="00:42:00.580" style="s2">have been infectious diseases for a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.220" end="00:42:03.400" style="s2">long period of time so but anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.580" end="00:42:05.470" style="s2">that&#39;s all very unsettling information</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.400" end="00:42:08.260" style="s2">because it sheds it so what it implies</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.470" end="00:42:10.030" style="s2">and this is quite cool it implies that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.260" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">the best way to control right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.030" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">authoritarianism is to is to instigate</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:19.300" style="s2">effective public health policy so if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:21.790" style="s2">all if everyone has a sewer and a toilet</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.300" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s no infectious disease</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.790" end="00:42:24.369" style="s2">there aren&#39;t any right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:26.230" style="s2">authoritarians anymore because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.369" end="00:42:29.350" style="s2">not necessary now that might be an</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.230" end="00:42:31.810" style="s2">overstatement but but it also might not</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.350" end="00:42:34.119" style="s2">be you know it&#39;s definitely one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.810" end="00:42:36.070" style="s2">prerequisites for the kind of stability</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.119" end="00:42:38.080" style="s2">and productivity that&#39;s characterized</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.070" end="00:42:40.270" style="s2">the West is that all of our cities have</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.080" end="00:42:40.930" style="s2">functional sewer systems and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.270" end="00:42:44.530" style="s2">has a toilet</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.930" end="00:42:46.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like turns out that makes a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.530" end="00:42:59.170" style="s2">difference especially when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.450" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">have one what should it should bring it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.170" end="00:43:03.070" style="s2">out you know and I&#39;m a reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">orderly person you know if I go into a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.070" end="00:43:08.410" style="s2">place that&#39;s chaotic especially if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:11.290" style="s2">chaotic and and and filthy I have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.410" end="00:43:13.960" style="s2">really really powerful impulse to Tromp</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.290" end="00:43:16.630" style="s2">around until it&#39;s fixed you know cuz it</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.960" end="00:43:18.700" style="s2">just strikes me as things are</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.630" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">deteriorating in a bad direction around</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.700" end="00:43:23.430" style="s2">here you know so and I&#39;m not I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:25.710" style="s2">say that one of my most outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.430" end="00:43:28.119" style="s2">characteristics is orderliness but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.710" end="00:43:30.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s up there I&#39;m a reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.119" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">conscientious person so yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.280" end="00:43:34.840" style="s2">visceral response and the visceral</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:36.670" style="s2">response is something needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.840" end="00:43:38.490" style="s2">about this you know and you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.670" end="00:43:40.810" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.490" end="00:43:42.580" style="s2">so what we&#39;ve been trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.810" end="00:43:45.100" style="s2">what makes conscientious people</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.580" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">motivated because conscientiousness</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.790" end="00:43:55.990" style="s2">no it&#39;s dutifulness okay so why is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:58.600" style="s2">a motivator we&#39;re thinking that what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.990" end="00:44:00.790" style="s2">conscientious person wants is not to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.600" end="00:44:01.359" style="s2">slide into the disgusting bottom of</p>

<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:08.619" style="s2">so imagine the hierarchy okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.469" end="00:44:11.829" style="s2">top is pure bottom is contaminated why</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.619" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">well I can tell you one reason if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.829" end="00:44:16.269" style="s2">take a given geographical locale this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:18.489" style="s2">even true for songbirds and you rank</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.269" end="00:44:20.799" style="s2">order the denizens of that locale by</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.489" end="00:44:24.099" style="s2">their dominance position and then you</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.099" end="00:44:29.049" style="s2">the bottom up right so the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.579" end="00:44:31.509" style="s2">dominance herky is where all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.049" end="00:44:34.119" style="s2">pathogens hang out and so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.509" end="00:44:36.729" style="s2">disgusting and it&#39;s morally impure and</p>

<p begin="00:44:36.729" end="00:44:40.950" style="s2">really a conservative viewpoint in many</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.259" end="00:44:44.019" style="s2">ways it&#39;s your fault you&#39;re there right</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.950" end="00:44:45.519" style="s2">and I&#39;m not gonna be there no matter</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.019" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">what and so I think what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.519" end="00:44:49.479" style="s2">conscientious person is doing is fleeing</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:51.640" style="s2">the bottom they&#39;re not trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.479" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">the top except that that&#39;s the farthest</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:57.459" style="s2">that&#39;s a purity motivation now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.779" end="00:44:58.839" style="s2">know that yet because we haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.459" end="00:45:02.380" style="s2">able to figure out how to motivate</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.839" end="00:45:04.479" style="s2">industrious people in the lab so which</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.380" end="00:45:06.219" style="s2">is weird right because conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.479" end="00:45:08.499" style="s2">predicts life success you&#39;d think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.219" end="00:45:09.910" style="s2">you could find a task in the lab that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.499" end="00:45:11.769" style="s2">conscientious people would do better</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.910" end="00:45:14.229" style="s2">than non conscientious people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.769" end="00:45:16.329" style="s2">tried dozens of things and not being</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.229" end="00:45:18.009" style="s2">able to do it so now we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.329" end="00:45:20.259" style="s2">make people embarrassed and ashamed and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.009" end="00:45:22.660" style="s2">see if we could get them to like donate</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.259" end="00:45:24.309" style="s2">more to a charity if we do that based on</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.660" end="00:45:26.650" style="s2">the idea that what&#39;s motivating the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.309" end="00:45:31.239" style="s2">conscientious person is a flight from</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.650" end="00:45:32.979" style="s2">contamination it could easily be so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.239" end="00:45:35.709" style="s2">quite mind-boggling like it was a twist</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.979" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">it was a twist I never I never forecast</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.709" end="00:45:40.539" style="s2">in my conceptualization of these things</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:42.190" style="s2">but the underworld you know it&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.539" end="00:45:44.410" style="s2">of chaos and fear but the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.190" end="00:45:46.359" style="s2">that&#39;s hell it&#39;s full of sulfurous odors</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.410" end="00:45:49.089" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.359" end="00:45:51.749" style="s2">terrifying it&#39;s all so disgusting and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.089" end="00:45:54.989" style="s2">its associated symbolically with</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.749" end="00:45:59.259" style="s2">disgusting elements of the body as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.989" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">so impurity obviously sexual purity for</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.259" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">example is certainly a hygiene purity</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:09.940" style="s2">admixture and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s flight from</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:11.559" style="s2">contamination and no wonder right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.940" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">the horse sexually transmitted diseases</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.559" end="00:46:14.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like a major vector of disease</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:17.569" style="s2">transmission which</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.630" end="00:46:21.829" style="s2">that with the AIDS outbreak you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.569" end="00:46:23.059" style="s2">without without airplanes there wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.829" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">be in any AIDS outbreak</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.059" end="00:46:29.329" style="s2">you know jet planes plus promiscuity</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:31.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like bang you know we almost</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.329" end="00:46:33.890" style="s2">generated a virus that took down the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.190" end="00:46:37.430" style="s2">whole planet so it&#39;s no joke when these</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.890" end="00:46:38.990" style="s2">things escape from there from their</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.430" end="00:46:40.670" style="s2">little box you know you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.990" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">why aren&#39;t people allowed to have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.670" end="00:46:48.410" style="s2">sexual life they want well the disease</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:50.779" style="s2">the relationship between disease</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.410" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">transmission and promiscuity is</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.779" end="00:46:55.670" style="s2">exponential that&#39;s why so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:47:01.130" style="s2">might think well that&#39;s no reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.670" end="00:47:02.569" style="s2">like okay maybe not but I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.130" end="00:47:08.650" style="s2">many hundreds of millions of people have</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.569" end="00:47:08.650" style="s2">died from AIDS but it&#39;s lots so you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.589" end="00:47:16.220" style="s2">we&#39;ll do that later we&#39;re gonna be doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.269" end="00:47:20.589" style="s2">a lot of distinguishing of that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.220" end="00:47:22.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a primary problem of men</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.589" end="00:47:25.609" style="s2">distinguishing Isis so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.700" end="00:47:28.190" style="s2">feminine underworld from evil right</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.609" end="00:47:29.779" style="s2">right because the because because there</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.190" end="00:47:32.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a negative element to both of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.779" end="00:47:34.730" style="s2">them if you haven&#39;t differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.210" end="00:47:36.829" style="s2">properly then the woman can carry that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.730" end="00:47:39.200" style="s2">whole load that happened to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.829" end="00:47:41.480" style="s2">with Eve for example in the in the in</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.200" end="00:47:42.980" style="s2">the Genesis story it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.480" end="00:47:44.230" style="s2">because if you read Genesis we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.980" end="00:47:46.549" style="s2">to talk about that later</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.230" end="00:47:49.700" style="s2">because the person who looks really bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.549" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">in Genesis isn&#39;t Eve the person who</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.700" end="00:47:53.960" style="s2">looks really bad is Adam no so II the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:56.509" style="s2">offers in the Apple and like a dance he</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:47:58.279" style="s2">takes it but then God comes along</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.509" end="00:48:01.220" style="s2">afterwards he&#39;s all self-conscious now</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.279" end="00:48:02.569" style="s2">and so is Eve and so God comes along to</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.220" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">have a little walk with Adam like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.569" end="00:48:05.900" style="s2">used to doing and Adam is hiding in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:08.930" style="s2">bushes cuz he&#39;s naked and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.900" end="00:48:11.660" style="s2">want God to see and so God calls them on</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.930" end="00:48:13.579" style="s2">it says like hey buddy I can see through</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.660" end="00:48:15.859" style="s2">bushes you know come out here where I</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.579" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">can talk to you and the Adam says oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.859" end="00:48:21.230" style="s2">naked I can&#39;t come out and God says how</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.559" end="00:48:24.170" style="s2">do you figure that out and Adam being</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.230" end="00:48:25.849" style="s2">the heroic creature that he was said you</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.170" end="00:48:27.980" style="s2">know that woman you made for me it&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.849" end="00:48:30.260" style="s2">fault it&#39;s like well who&#39;s the villain</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.980" end="00:48:32.359" style="s2">in that story he&#39;s such a weasel that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.260" end="00:48:33.950" style="s2">when he gets called on his disobedience</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.359" end="00:48:36.170" style="s2">the first thing he does is blame the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.950" end="00:48:37.940" style="s2">woman it&#39;s like yeah yeah well that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.170" end="00:48:41.660" style="s2">archetypal story I&#39;ll tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.940" end="00:48:43.340" style="s2">you know so the temptations of Eve you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.660" end="00:48:45.050" style="s2">know it&#39;s like the rapists who blame the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.340" end="00:48:48.350" style="s2">attractiveness of the woman for the rape</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.050" end="00:48:51.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like the devil made me do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.350" end="00:48:54.260" style="s2">you know so anyways it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.980" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">to distinguish one form of negative from</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.260" end="00:48:57.850" style="s2">another and partly what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:49:00.290" style="s2">do when we go through the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.850" end="00:49:03.350" style="s2">differentiation process is put things in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.290" end="00:49:05.740" style="s2">their proper place so I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.350" end="00:49:05.740" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.690" end="00:49:16.130" style="s2">look that&#39;s the wrong direction sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.180" end="00:49:18.579" style="s2">want to show you this one diagram and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.130" end="00:49:18.579" style="s2">then stop</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.830" end="00:49:37.090" style="s2">they&#39;re so for me that&#39;s the map of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.180" end="00:49:38.830" style="s2">symbolic sphere okay so what you have in</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.090" end="00:49:41.560" style="s2">the very background is the dragon of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.830" end="00:49:44.170" style="s2">chaos that&#39;s the absolute unknown as</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.560" end="00:49:46.090" style="s2">such so you can think about it is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.170" end="00:49:49.540" style="s2">chaos from which everything else emerges</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.090" end="00:49:51.130" style="s2">so that&#39;s the unknown unknowns okay on</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.540" end="00:49:52.750" style="s2">top of that there&#39;s a feminine layer</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.130" end="00:49:54.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the great mother</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.750" end="00:49:56.140" style="s2">and the great mother has a positive</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.370" end="00:49:58.020" style="s2">aspect she&#39;s mother of all things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.140" end="00:50:01.120" style="s2">she has a negative aspect and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.020" end="00:50:02.470" style="s2">she&#39;s the angry time at the force of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.120" end="00:50:05.560" style="s2">death that pulls all biological</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.470" end="00:50:07.870" style="s2">creatures back into her grasp creation</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.560" end="00:50:10.840" style="s2">and destruction so on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.870" end="00:50:11.920" style="s2">there&#39;s culture and culture protects you</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.840" end="00:50:14.260" style="s2">from the great mother</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.920" end="00:50:16.090" style="s2">just like with Osiris you Isis stays in</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.260" end="00:50:17.740" style="s2">the underworld where she belongs but</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.090" end="00:50:19.660" style="s2">culture has a negative element and a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.740" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">positive element so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.660" end="00:50:23.950" style="s2">patriarchal it&#39;s represented by</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:26.200" style="s2">masculine figures but it has an element</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.950" end="00:50:28.180" style="s2">that offers order and an element that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.200" end="00:50:30.430" style="s2">offers tyranny and there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.180" end="00:50:32.050" style="s2">balance between those two and so if</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.430" end="00:50:33.880" style="s2">you&#39;re a conservative you think hooray</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.050" end="00:50:36.040" style="s2">order and if you&#39;re a lefty you think oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.880" end="00:50:38.560" style="s2">no tyranny and you&#39;re both right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.040" end="00:50:40.270" style="s2">because every organization tends towards</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.560" end="00:50:42.520" style="s2">tyranny and supports you at the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.270" end="00:50:44.950" style="s2">time so it&#39;s it&#39;s right on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.520" end="00:50:47.830" style="s2">there&#39;s the archetypal individual now</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.950" end="00:50:49.060" style="s2">it&#39;s also represented now in masculine</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.830" end="00:50:50.830" style="s2">form for reasons that we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.060" end="00:50:53.650" style="s2">later but it has a positive and a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.830" end="00:50:56.680" style="s2">negative - and the positive is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.650" end="00:50:59.440" style="s2">creative Explorer moving out into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.680" end="00:51:01.840" style="s2">darkness with eyes open and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">the counterpart of that which is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.840" end="00:51:04.780" style="s2">thing you shake hands with when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:06.850" style="s2">romeo Dallaire and you shake hands with</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.780" end="00:51:09.070" style="s2">the devil and that&#39;s the individual -</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.850" end="00:51:11.410" style="s2">and one of the things I would you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.070" end="00:51:13.230" style="s2">think about this but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.410" end="00:51:15.850" style="s2">that I really like about this map is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.230" end="00:51:19.000" style="s2">that I think it&#39;s the antidote for</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.850" end="00:51:22.510" style="s2">ideology and the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.000" end="00:51:23.890" style="s2">you can map ideologies onto this map but</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.510" end="00:51:24.490" style="s2">the ideologies only give you half the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.890" end="00:51:26.770" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.490" end="00:51:30.130" style="s2">so like the left-wing story would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.770" end="00:51:32.470" style="s2">lovely virginal mother nature being</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.130" end="00:51:34.990" style="s2">terrorized by the evil corporations as</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.470" end="00:51:38.080" style="s2">civilization advances led by the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.990" end="00:51:41.130" style="s2">adversarial individual but the right</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.080" end="00:51:43.630" style="s2">wing story is the heroic individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.130" end="00:51:46.030" style="s2">bringing order into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.630" end="00:51:48.190" style="s2">to avoid the destructive element of of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.030" end="00:51:51.100" style="s2">the natural world so that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.190" end="00:51:53.500" style="s2">frontier myth that that that settled the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.100" end="00:51:55.690" style="s2">United States right heroic pioneers</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.500" end="00:51:57.730" style="s2">moving civilization into the chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.690" end="00:52:00.670" style="s2">unknown you just slam those two together</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.730" end="00:52:03.940" style="s2">and then you got the real problem which</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.670" end="00:52:06.760" style="s2">is that nature slash the unknown is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.940" end="00:52:09.370" style="s2">creative source of everything and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.760" end="00:52:12.340" style="s2">will pull you into pieces if if it has</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.370" end="00:52:15.370" style="s2">the opportunity and then culture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.340" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">like you can talk and it&#39;s warm you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.370" end="00:52:19.120" style="s2">better be happy with culture but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:21.250" style="s2">probability that it&#39;s gonna take you and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.120" end="00:52:22.870" style="s2">crunch you and try to turn you into a</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.250" end="00:52:24.940" style="s2">carb it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.870" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">gonna do that&#39;s what it does and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.940" end="00:52:30.010" style="s2">there&#39;s you well yeah you&#39;re a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:33.850" style="s2">interesting you know great creature but</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.010" end="00:52:35.980" style="s2">look the hell out so and that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.850" end="00:52:38.530" style="s2">that and I think the archetypal stories</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.980" end="00:52:42.130" style="s2">do a lovely job of continually bringing</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.530" end="00:52:45.360" style="s2">those elements together so yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.130" end="00:52:45.360" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s good enough</p>
