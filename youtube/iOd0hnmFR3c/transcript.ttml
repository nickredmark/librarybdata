<p begin="00:00:01.979" end="00:00:08.309" style="s2">on a hillside near Mount Shasta to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.160" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">in light of your recent publication in</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:11.070" style="s2">Collett Heather and some of the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:13.469" style="s2">that you&#39;ve gotten we&#39;re gonna talk a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.070" end="00:00:15.030" style="s2">little bit about sex and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.469" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.030" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">evolutionary lens through which one</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">might view sex start with a basic is it</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:32.579" style="s2">better to be a man or a woman yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:36.320" style="s2">yes it is better to be it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.579" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">neither better to be male nor female in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:42.690" style="s2">any population that is experiencing sex</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:43.860" style="s2">ratios the likes of which every</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.690" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">population that we know of with</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">exceedingly rare exceptions have</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">experienced throughout history yes but</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:52.170" style="s2">you evaded the question I asked you man</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">or woman I&#39;ve always enjoyed being</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.170" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">female you&#39;ve always enjoyed it I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">always enjoyed you being male I see yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">well being straight and all and it is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">mathematical inevitability that either</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">sex which is limiting which there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">not enough will be produced in greater</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">numbers the next generation because they</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">will be the more valuable it sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:24.869" style="s2">technical but in the case of many women</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:27.869" style="s2">is it not clear that it is better to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.869" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">a man because if you play your cards</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.869" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">right you get to go to bed with women ah</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:37.290" style="s2">see now that said said like a straight</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">man my favorite so my feeling is as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">might imagine the corollary which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">that not really even having to play your</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">cards right you get to engage with with</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">men sexually but if you play your cards</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:59.490" style="s2">right you get to go to bed as you say</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.030" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">with excellent yes I see that&#39;s all very</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.490" end="00:02:04.579" style="s2">confusing I can&#39;t imagine why anyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">would want to do it and I must say</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.579" end="00:02:11.670" style="s2">should reincarnation be a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:13.349" style="s2">which I assume it isn&#39;t since there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.670" end="00:02:13.710" style="s2">zero evidence for it but if it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.349" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">thing I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:18.450" style="s2">hope assuming that reincarnation does</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:21.210" style="s2">not involve us interacting in the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.450" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">I hope you do come back as as a man so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.210" end="00:02:31.350" style="s2">that you can test your hypothesis all</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">right well somehow yeah there&#39;s tracks</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.350" end="00:02:35.640" style="s2">right over there yes so we&#39;ve gotta off</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">the rails without even being near that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.640" end="00:02:39.330" style="s2">we were we did not start out on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:41.070" style="s2">rails I will grant you that all right so</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.330" end="00:02:43.020" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s go back to the question that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.070" end="00:02:44.820" style="s2">you seemed insistence on attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.020" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">answer here which is is it better to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.820" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">male or female is it not obvious that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:52.380" style="s2">is better to be male because in most</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">species males can produce huge numbers</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.380" end="00:02:56.070" style="s2">of offspring and females because they</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:02:58.200" style="s2">invest more in each offspring produce</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.070" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">smaller numbers so evolution being what</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.200" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">it is and it having something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">producing large numbers of offspring</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">isn&#39;t it evolutionarily better to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:10.350" style="s2">male no because every man imagines that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">he&#39;s that guy that he&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.350" end="00:03:14.490" style="s2">Genghis Khan of his generation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:16.140" style="s2">produce more kids than anyone else ever</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.490" end="00:03:17.880" style="s2">has and of course no modern man is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.140" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">thinking in terms of production of kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.880" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">but the proxy is I&#39;m gonna have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">sites a lot of sites of all women may be</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">settling down but also keeping my eye</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">out for all the other sexual</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:29.190" style="s2">opportunities that are out there most</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">men aren&#39;t that guy and so any</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.190" end="00:03:38.700" style="s2">population in which there is a gig is</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">gone there are many many men getting a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.700" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">late start at it that&#39;s for sure we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:45.810" style="s2">could agree that as Genghis Khan&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:47.610" style="s2">I&#39;m not a you know an early bloomer well</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.810" end="00:03:49.320" style="s2">we agree that you&#39;re gonna keep your</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.610" end="00:03:50.550" style="s2">eyes on the prize that is our children</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.320" end="00:03:52.800" style="s2">that are already extent the universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.550" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah no they&#39;re my first</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.800" end="00:03:57.600" style="s2">priority for sure okay in a population</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2">where Genghis Khan exists there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.600" end="00:04:01.410" style="s2">going to be a ton of men who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:04.320" style="s2">involuntarily celibate</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.410" end="00:04:06.240" style="s2">whereas in any population across human</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.320" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">history and indeed across the broad</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.240" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">swath of other organisms all females in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.900" style="s2">the pre producer and so the variation</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:15.240" style="s2">the variability in what is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.900" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">reproductive success for females is far</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.240" end="00:04:19.290" style="s2">lower from the variability in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:20.790" style="s2">reproductive success for males and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.290" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">fact we see that greater male</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.790" end="00:04:24.700" style="s2">variability hypothesis born out in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:27.130" style="s2">number of other areas</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.700" end="00:04:30.490" style="s2">things like mathematical ability as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.130" end="00:04:32.470" style="s2">but in terms of reproductive success the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.490" end="00:04:36.610" style="s2">male who has reproduced the most has had</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.470" end="00:04:38.950" style="s2">far more kids than then any woman could</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.610" end="00:04:41.410" style="s2">and certainly there are some women who</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.950" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">have had no children and some men who</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.410" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">have had no children so it would appear</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:46.210" style="s2">that the lower limit is just the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:48.430" style="s2">and while the number is the same zero</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.210" end="00:04:52.480" style="s2">the number of men throughout history who</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:55.660" style="s2">have left no offspring is an order of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.480" end="00:04:57.220" style="s2">magnitude higher than the percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.660" end="00:04:59.950" style="s2">women in any given population who leave</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.220" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2">the hospital so if we imagine that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.950" end="00:05:04.570" style="s2">average man sits at some position in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">terms of number of offspring that he</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.570" end="00:05:10.810" style="s2">leaves in any given moment in history</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:13.390" style="s2">for everyone who beats the odds there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.810" end="00:05:15.640" style="s2">one who under performs is that fair to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.390" end="00:05:17.560" style="s2">say and so the same thing is true for</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.640" end="00:05:21.190" style="s2">females because it takes a male and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.560" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">female to produce offspring in creatures</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.190" end="00:05:27.640" style="s2">like us there are there is an equal</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:30.310" style="s2">average in the population for the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.640" end="00:05:34.060" style="s2">of offspring produced but the variance</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.310" end="00:05:36.730" style="s2">is much greater for males right so so in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.060" end="00:05:38.950" style="s2">any population we&#39;re polygyny often more</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.730" end="00:05:41.290" style="s2">generically and slightly less precisely</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.950" end="00:05:44.200" style="s2">called polygamy in any population where</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.290" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">polygamy is norm there will be more</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.200" end="00:05:48.040" style="s2">women than men reproducing in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:50.290" style="s2">population but that does not change the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.040" end="00:05:52.390" style="s2">fact that every single one of us barring</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.290" end="00:05:54.070" style="s2">the gross cases of incest have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.390" end="00:05:57.850" style="s2">exactly equal number of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.070" end="00:06:00.640" style="s2">ancestors okay so in a case let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.850" end="00:06:03.640" style="s2">it&#39;s human beings and there&#39;s been a war</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.640" end="00:06:06.460" style="s2">that has eliminated a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.640" end="00:06:10.210" style="s2">men from a population is it now better</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.460" end="00:06:13.540" style="s2">to be male or female better in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.210" end="00:06:15.670" style="s2">that like at that moment in time if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.540" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">were a parent producing offspring would</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.670" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">it be better to produce male offspring</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:21.160" style="s2">or female offspring at that instant</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">well actually the answer is the same in</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.160" end="00:06:27.010" style="s2">the moment you are going to produce more</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:30.280" style="s2">kids if you&#39;re male because you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.010" end="00:06:33.100" style="s2">males are limiting therefore you are a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.280" end="00:06:34.900" style="s2">rare commodity and into the next</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.100" end="00:06:37.240" style="s2">generation especially if you can produce</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.900" end="00:06:38.260" style="s2">kids quickly that is likely to be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.240" end="00:06:40.810" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.260" end="00:06:44.380" style="s2">in until it corrects and so pretty boys</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.810" end="00:06:45.970" style="s2">are for the moment going to be more</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.380" end="00:06:49.240" style="s2">valuable and therefore produced in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.970" end="00:06:51.130" style="s2">greater numbers so and the inverse would</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.240" end="00:06:53.530" style="s2">also be true in the case where for</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.130" end="00:06:55.990" style="s2">instance there has been a lot of sex</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.530" end="00:06:57.880" style="s2">selective abortion as is true in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.990" end="00:07:01.020" style="s2">cultures women are limiting and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.880" end="00:07:04.540" style="s2">therefore women become more valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.020" end="00:07:06.640" style="s2">and have greater choice among partners</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.540" end="00:07:08.260" style="s2">when they come of age which I must say</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.640" end="00:07:10.300" style="s2">raises a deep question that I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.260" end="00:07:12.700" style="s2">heard well answered and I&#39;m afraid the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.300" end="00:07:16.690" style="s2">answer is actually quite frightening but</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.700" end="00:07:18.580" style="s2">in a culture where women are less common</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.690" end="00:07:20.920" style="s2">because of selective abortion you should</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.580" end="00:07:23.140" style="s2">imagine that women would be in high</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.920" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">demand and therefore they should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.140" end="00:07:27.550" style="s2">prized as offspring and yet that is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:29.320" style="s2">typically what we understand from such</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.550" end="00:07:31.750" style="s2">cultures so that&#39;s a mystery that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.320" end="00:07:33.130" style="s2">have to address separately but norms</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.750" end="00:07:35.620" style="s2">don&#39;t change as quickly as we think they</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.130" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">should be able to I actually don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.620" end="00:07:39.310" style="s2">that cuts it oh I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:40.660" style="s2">think it&#39;s full fully explanatory but</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.310" end="00:07:43.390" style="s2">it&#39;s true I think that is an observation</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.660" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">without being particularly explanatory I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.390" end="00:07:48.100" style="s2">think there is something about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">that the cultural norm which obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.100" end="00:07:53.350" style="s2">could turn on a dime does not shift in</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:07:55.570" style="s2">the direction of female offspring that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.350" end="00:07:58.870" style="s2">suggests that actually an overproduction</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.570" end="00:08:00.910" style="s2">of male offspring has a value that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.870" end="00:08:04.270" style="s2">have yet to describe well we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.910" end="00:08:07.260" style="s2">talking about about adaptive value at</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.270" end="00:08:10.480" style="s2">the individual level and a population</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.260" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">will be better suited to something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.480" end="00:08:15.370" style="s2">warfare if it has an over production</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:17.260" style="s2">with men yeah but our field has yet to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.370" end="00:08:20.050" style="s2">acknowledge that that level of selection</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.260" end="00:08:21.610" style="s2">exists and so in some sense I think we</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.050" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">are upended here by the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.610" end="00:08:26.950" style="s2">don&#39;t have the right tools yet but so</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:29.260" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s just finish out the general</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.950" end="00:08:30.010" style="s2">biological case it&#39;s not better to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.260" end="00:08:32.260" style="s2">male or female</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.010" end="00:08:33.910" style="s2">because although the variance is higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.260" end="00:08:35.950" style="s2">for males and therefore a super</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.910" end="00:08:37.930" style="s2">successful male is better than a super</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.950" end="00:08:39.970" style="s2">successful female from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.930" end="00:08:42.340" style="s2">of how many offspring he produces the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.970" end="00:08:44.110" style="s2">chances of underperforming counteract</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.340" end="00:08:46.270" style="s2">the value of over-performing so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.110" end="00:08:48.310" style="s2">males and females end up dead even and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.270" end="00:08:49.900" style="s2">and in a stable population which of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.310" end="00:08:51.550" style="s2">course humans on earth parts they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.900" end="00:08:54.760" style="s2">growing population</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.550" end="00:08:56.950" style="s2">a stable population on average every man</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.760" end="00:08:58.660" style="s2">and every woman produces two offspring</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.950" end="00:09:00.459" style="s2">that survive to reproduce with the next</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.660" end="00:09:02.410" style="s2">generation two and only two no matter</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.459" end="00:09:04.420" style="s2">how many they produce no matter if there</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.410" end="00:09:07.029" style="s2">are frogs that produce 10,000 for mating</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.420" end="00:09:09.250" style="s2">event or people who produce one in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.029" end="00:09:11.709" style="s2">stable population isn&#39;t it growing it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.250" end="00:09:14.589" style="s2">again mathematically true that only two</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.709" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">of those children that were produced via</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.589" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">sexual means as opposed to you some kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:21.730" style="s2">of basically production like like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.910" end="00:09:24.070" style="s2">cloning or according to josephus will</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.730" end="00:09:26.769" style="s2">survive to reproduce themselves yep I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.070" end="00:09:28.839" style="s2">always try to be careful about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.769" end="00:09:31.209" style="s2">because when you say every you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.839" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">talking about on average and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.209" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that says you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">some couples that wildly overproduced</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:38.890" style="s2">the two offspring that would read that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:40.690" style="s2">would replace them in the population and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.890" end="00:09:42.610" style="s2">other couples underperform it just the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.690" end="00:09:45.820" style="s2">same way individuals can over perform or</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.610" end="00:09:48.220" style="s2">underperform but on average in a stable</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.820" end="00:09:50.019" style="s2">population every pair produces two</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.220" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">offspring that survive to reproduce and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.019" end="00:09:53.610" style="s2">that&#39;s just simply a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:57.220" style="s2">mathematical fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.610" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">but the logic to walk away from this</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.220" end="00:10:01.990" style="s2">with is from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:03.910" style="s2">producing offspring males and females in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.990" end="00:10:06.130" style="s2">a population in which males and females</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.910" end="00:10:08.680" style="s2">are equally common are equally valuable</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.130" end="00:10:10.149" style="s2">there are reasons that an individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.680" end="00:10:12.490" style="s2">might want to produce males or females</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.149" end="00:10:14.260" style="s2">if that individual knows something about</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.490" end="00:10:16.510" style="s2">what sorts of offspring it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.260" end="00:10:18.550" style="s2">produce but absent that information</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.510" end="00:10:21.220" style="s2">males and females are equally valuable</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.550" end="00:10:23.770" style="s2">in a population in which either males or</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.220" end="00:10:26.470" style="s2">females have become rare producing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.770" end="00:10:28.540" style="s2">rare sex has disproportionate value and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.470" end="00:10:30.370" style="s2">so there are moments in time at which</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.540" end="00:10:33.070" style="s2">the logic does not hold for a given</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.370" end="00:10:37.930" style="s2">population and being one or the other is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.070" end="00:10:41.350" style="s2">better but there is not a bias in terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.930" end="00:10:43.870" style="s2">of which sex ought to be better in other</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.350" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">words it&#39;s whatever sex happens to be in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.870" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">short supply that maybe males because</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">males are risk takers it may be more</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:54.130" style="s2">frequent that males are in low supply</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">and therefore producing males will have</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.130" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">a an extra benefit for the parents who</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:02.140" style="s2">do it but in general it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.360" end="00:11:05.530" style="s2">which sex has become rare historically</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.140" end="00:11:08.620" style="s2">the risks to males have been things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.530" end="00:11:11.110" style="s2">hunting and warfare and the risks to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.620" end="00:11:14.740" style="s2">females have been in humans childbirth</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.110" end="00:11:17.860" style="s2">hunting warfare and anything that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.740" end="00:11:20.770" style="s2">follows hold my beer more watch this</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.860" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">yeah that that&#39;s a biggie for men</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.770" end="00:11:25.780" style="s2">sometimes for boys look ma no hands</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:29.560" style="s2">look ma no hands or hold my root beer</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.780" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">also that&#39;s one sometimes yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.560" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">well I think this is a good introductory</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">lesson in terms of how to think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:40.930" style="s2">sex from an evolutionary perspective hey</p>
