<p begin="00:00:10.460" end="00:00:15.179" style="s2">feeling on communism or Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:21.140" style="s2">whichever you would like to answer it on</p>

<p begin="00:00:27.900" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">actually so it&#39;s not clear what you were</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">saying it&#39;s funny why it&#39;s actually so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">many tabulator but all right I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">meet me in a moment I understand why</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:54.420" style="s2">it&#39;s doing that it hasn&#39;t done that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:01:00.090" style="s2">before but would anybody like to take my</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.420" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">domestic experts questions well um it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.090" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">looks like I&#39;m not muted so maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">just start I guess the the sort of meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">thing for me on this is that this is one</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:14.340" style="s2">of those instances where definitions</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">matter and it seems like most of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.340" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">conversations around communism Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">there there&#39;s never they never get to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">find especially online when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">little kid you know like seventh grade</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">or something I remember reading the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:36.780" style="s2">Communist Manifesto for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">and you know what I thought that it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.780" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">going to be about and what it actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">ended up being about you know no almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">almost no connection and I feel like in</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">the end you know it&#39;s like everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">always speaking past each other here at</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">the on the the right hand or the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">side of the pectoral seems to define the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">communism is meaning you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">killing fields and or whatever possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">you know Venezuela and or it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">certain very very specific horrible</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:18.320" style="s2">things and it excludes</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:22.830" style="s2">other other things where&#39;s I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.320" end="00:02:24.120" style="s2">mean Marxism to me I you know even</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.830" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">though it&#39;s been a million years since</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.120" end="00:02:27.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in grad school and I have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">idea of what the Academy is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.990" end="00:02:33.990" style="s2">talking about it anymore you know I hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">the I hear the reports about it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.990" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">know that I trust what I hear people say</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:42.210" style="s2">but you know marks to me Marxism is more</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:46.410" style="s2">of a framework of analysis rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.210" end="00:02:52.770" style="s2">an in the state of anything and you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.410" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">power relations and communism is never</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.770" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">existent so it&#39;s sort of a moot point</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like this this in this you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:07.550" style="s2">know final stage of some sort of process</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">so I guess my feelings about it are</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.550" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">frustration the frustration that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:21.330" style="s2">conversation is never grounded enough in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:22.740" style="s2">a shared you know whatever looks just a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.330" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">little backwards start shared</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.740" end="00:03:31.340" style="s2">definitions the idea that there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">could be a critique in any way of of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.340" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">capitalism I mean it seems fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">to me which doesn&#39;t mean I also think</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:40.860" style="s2">that most of the conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:42.930" style="s2">capitalism end up the same way where</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.860" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">nobody&#39;s defining their terms or saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.930" end="00:03:59.030" style="s2">what they mean so I guess that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:59.030" style="s2">vague and non-committal interesting okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.870" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">yeah okay let me know if if the sound is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.880" end="00:04:13.739" style="s2">not coming through clearly yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:17.820" style="s2">relate to what you were sharing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.739" end="00:04:19.950" style="s2">about defining of the concepts that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.820" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">definitely a very important thing for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.950" end="00:04:25.950" style="s2">as well and at the same time I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:29.160" style="s2">to kind of expand that and think</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.950" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">what else what besides that is as</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.160" end="00:04:35.340" style="s2">relevant for me in this thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">guess I want to turn even kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.340" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">generally to the human humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:46.290" style="s2">interacting and not even maybe going</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:48.570" style="s2">that far to the kind of defining the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.290" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2">terms but more like agreeing on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.570" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">intention of the conversation just why</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:56.520" style="s2">are we talking why are we here in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:59.250" style="s2">general because I think that&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.520" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">trend and part of a kind of a big issue</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.250" end="00:05:06.120" style="s2">in our cultures is that we self express</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.810" end="00:05:08.330" style="s2">we don&#39;t really communicate and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.120" end="00:05:10.770" style="s2">different difference putting it out that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.330" end="00:05:13.590" style="s2">when I made self expressing like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.770" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">modern artist I don&#39;t even expect to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.590" end="00:05:17.910" style="s2">understood maybe I&#39;m just putting it out</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:21.420" style="s2">there and just think about well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.910" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">how I see it or how I frame it while</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.420" end="00:05:28.050" style="s2">communication implies seeking that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:29.490" style="s2">the message would get through and then I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.050" end="00:05:33.660" style="s2">would even get the feedback that it got</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:34.920" style="s2">through so if if I don&#39;t see people</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.660" end="00:05:37.350" style="s2">understanding me then it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.920" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">responsibility to keep trying other ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.350" end="00:05:42.590" style="s2">to send it but if people come to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.540" style="s2">conversation and they don&#39;t explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.590" end="00:05:47.850" style="s2">explicitly state that that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.540" end="00:05:49.590" style="s2">intention to communicate rather than</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.850" end="00:05:52.290" style="s2">self express and they don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.590" end="00:05:55.950" style="s2">they&#39;re there then I think very often</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.290" end="00:05:58.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a futile endeavor and then more</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.950" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">specifically as a reaction to towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.350" end="00:06:07.620" style="s2">the topic is that it&#39;s well for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:11.460" style="s2">I&#39;m already biased against those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.620" end="00:06:16.470" style="s2">in a sense that I was born in the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.460" end="00:06:18.660" style="s2">Union in lessly I was raised while</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.470" end="00:06:20.760" style="s2">seeing quite a lot of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.660" end="00:06:23.430" style="s2">later after the independence hearing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.760" end="00:06:26.580" style="s2">lot of bad stuff that was going on so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.430" end="00:06:28.950" style="s2">definitely I have a kind of a very much</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.580" end="00:06:30.900" style="s2">like that concern of how will that be</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.950" end="00:06:34.730" style="s2">implemented if there&#39;s again some kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.900" end="00:06:37.320" style="s2">of attempt to introduce those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.730" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">especially if somebody follows the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.320" end="00:06:41.660" style="s2">principle rather than the practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:45.860" style="s2">because there are lots of social ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.660" end="00:06:48.750" style="s2">kind of from democratic socialism to</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.860" end="00:06:51.090" style="s2">social democracy all those things</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.750" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of on that spectrum so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.090" end="00:07:01.460" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of stuff that is not pure</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:04.290" style="s2">loser fair market and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.460" end="00:07:06.780" style="s2">essentially we are experiencing some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.290" end="00:07:12.420" style="s2">those aspects some some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.780" end="00:07:19.500" style="s2">that is part of that framework that Marx</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.420" end="00:07:23.850" style="s2">said and so well it is confusing to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.500" end="00:07:29.940" style="s2">the least and it is kind of worrisome</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.850" end="00:07:31.470" style="s2">when when even the let&#39;s say describing</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.940" end="00:07:33.810" style="s2">that as a kind of a left side of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.470" end="00:07:35.490" style="s2">spectrum although I don&#39;t subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.810" end="00:07:38.250" style="s2">the left and right that&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.490" end="00:07:41.340" style="s2">restrictive but if simplifying it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.250" end="00:07:43.170" style="s2">those terms there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.340" end="00:07:47.070" style="s2">disagreement and if you would just take</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.170" end="00:07:49.020" style="s2">even among the Marxists leaning people</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.070" end="00:07:50.940" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a bit of a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.020" end="00:07:54.480" style="s2">distinction from what I&#39;ve seen between</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.940" end="00:07:59.130" style="s2">kind of clear anarchists ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.480" end="00:08:01.740" style="s2">some other groups and so it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.130" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">it&#39;s since its kind of considered fringe</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.740" end="00:08:07.710" style="s2">in the Western culture and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:09.420" style="s2">really part of the overtones window</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.710" end="00:08:12.150" style="s2">nobody really talks about those things</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.420" end="00:08:13.980" style="s2">in kind of a very neutral terms and just</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.150" end="00:08:16.380" style="s2">with curiosity it&#39;s more like you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.980" end="00:08:20.580" style="s2">these are French people we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.380" end="00:08:22.850" style="s2">care about their opinions so when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.580" end="00:08:25.290" style="s2">hear so little it&#39;s difficult to know</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.850" end="00:08:27.470" style="s2">what are the people how are the people</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.290" end="00:08:29.340" style="s2">who are thinking of those things and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.470" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">talking of those things so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.340" end="00:08:35.010" style="s2">difficult to relate unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:36.810" style="s2">delving into YouTube and some other</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.010" end="00:08:40.260" style="s2">places and really exploring it and give</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.810" end="00:08:45.240" style="s2">more deeply you don&#39;t just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.260" end="00:08:48.410" style="s2">about that and and I guess that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.240" end="00:08:48.410" style="s2">makes it more confusing</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.790" end="00:08:54.740" style="s2">and although I&#39;ve looked into some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.910" end="00:08:57.890" style="s2">those ideas and I&#39;m curious and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.740" end="00:09:01.240" style="s2">definitely leaning closer to the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.890" end="00:09:04.730" style="s2">ideas because of some psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.240" end="00:09:08.980" style="s2">practices that are more empathetic more</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.730" end="00:09:12.820" style="s2">inclusive more communitarian in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:15.310" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s still kind of concerning</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.820" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">remembering the history that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.310" end="00:09:20.120" style="s2">implementation is a difficult part you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:21.950" style="s2">know you can define something very</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.120" end="00:09:25.880" style="s2">nicely in the vision but then how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.950" end="00:09:29.300" style="s2">getting there it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.880" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">and I guess that&#39;s with many different</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.300" end="00:09:35.959" style="s2">ideas not just economical and social</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.390" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">structure ones yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.959" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">reaction thank you thank you I will</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:44.269" style="s2">share since there&#39;s only three of us i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:46.339" style="s2">cherdon in all three so far the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.269" end="00:09:48.230" style="s2">cafes now um I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.339" end="00:09:51.589" style="s2">repeating myself I probably am but with</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.230" end="00:09:55.459" style="s2">my memory issues I never know um I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.589" end="00:10:00.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of beauty in communism and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.459" end="00:10:02.270" style="s2">Marxism as it is written out in a like</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.230" end="00:10:05.000" style="s2">the idea of it not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.270" end="00:10:07.220" style="s2">implementation of it if we look at that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.000" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">beauty and ignore the atrocities that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.220" end="00:10:10.070" style="s2">have been committed under it we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:12.110" style="s2">it a disservice because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.070" end="00:10:16.010" style="s2">something about the implementation of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.110" end="00:10:18.260" style="s2">these beautiful ideals that when forced</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.010" end="00:10:21.790" style="s2">upon a population ends up with</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.260" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">atrocities and I think there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.790" end="00:10:26.779" style="s2">for us to have the good without the bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.339" style="s2">and it&#39;s not implementing it on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.779" end="00:10:30.860" style="s2">massive scale it&#39;s doing it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.339" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">that&#39;s safe enough to try that&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.860" end="00:10:36.410" style="s2">at the individual piece how much do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:40.579" style="s2">want to have personal autonomy and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.410" end="00:10:43.250" style="s2">much can we have group coherence and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.579" end="00:10:45.170" style="s2">can we work as a collective as a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.250" end="00:10:49.190" style="s2">collective either globally or nationally</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.170" end="00:10:52.490" style="s2">whatever scale were on in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.190" end="00:10:54.890" style="s2">efficient without handing over our power</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.490" end="00:10:57.470" style="s2">to a tiny group it clearly will never</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.890" end="00:10:59.300" style="s2">hand power back because that I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.470" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried that and it doesn&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.300" end="00:11:02.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work under fascism it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:03.930" style="s2">work under you know debauch</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.550" end="00:11:06.990" style="s2">using capitalism and it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.930" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">under communism so I think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.990" end="00:11:14.430" style="s2">a lot of benefit to the ideals and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">also think that Marx died a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.430" end="00:11:19.560" style="s2">years ago over a hundred years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:22.290" style="s2">to hold him as the father of something</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.560" end="00:11:24.269" style="s2">that he couldn&#39;t possibly understand how</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.290" end="00:11:27.300" style="s2">it would implement in today&#39;s world with</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.269" end="00:11:31.800" style="s2">technology with you know this global</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.300" end="00:11:33.269" style="s2">society and so to hand over our power to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.800" end="00:11:35.160" style="s2">someone who died a hundred years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.269" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">say this must be written out in a letter</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.160" end="00:11:39.420" style="s2">of the law doesn&#39;t work and to me throw</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:42.209" style="s2">everything out doesn&#39;t work and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.420" end="00:11:44.310" style="s2">with Anna that definitions definitely</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.209" end="00:11:46.980" style="s2">help in discussions otherwise we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.310" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">doing that piece of like arguing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.980" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">what somebody didn&#39;t say instead</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:53.880" style="s2">assuming that their definitions the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:56.640" style="s2">as ours and we&#39;re kind of arguing our</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.880" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">definition before ever actually deciding</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.640" end="00:12:01.350" style="s2">on one so those are my thoughts on it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:05.100" style="s2">and now we can all unmute and have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.350" end="00:12:07.700" style="s2">discussion now that I&#39;m sorry about all</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.100" end="00:12:08.820" style="s2">the bean off-camera and being completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.700" end="00:12:13.079" style="s2">discombobulated</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.820" end="00:12:16.200" style="s2">much better without the echo yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.079" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">okay no problem it feel like you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.200" end="00:12:25.020" style="s2">the room somewhere they&#39;re listing hmm</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">well just when you were saying these</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.020" end="00:12:32.850" style="s2">things about Marx being like not</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:35.310" style="s2">involved in those later implementations</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.850" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">I remembered another thought that I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.310" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">before that in a sense makes it also</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">less relevant what he said or didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:45.930" style="s2">is that well he was just one person okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.610" end="00:12:49.140" style="s2">well maybe with some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.930" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">thinking and it&#39;s not as he&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.140" end="00:12:53.699" style="s2">of superhuman and we couldn&#39;t come up</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">with those ideas in a more appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.699" end="00:12:58.620" style="s2">fashion so we don&#39;t even need to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:00.870" style="s2">attach yourself to his name or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.620" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">we can use whatever resource we have we</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:05.820" style="s2">can take all the ideas from wherever</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:07.589" style="s2">rather than just putting it well mark</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.820" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">said that and maybe he was right on</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.589" end="00:13:15.149" style="s2">whatever just focusing on that place and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:15.850" style="s2">location as if we are not empowered</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.149" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.850" end="00:13:20.649" style="s2">or a be capable enough of coming up</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:23.610" style="s2">with those same maybe conclusions or</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.649" end="00:13:27.810" style="s2">better ones yet it&#39;s so just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.610" end="00:13:30.759" style="s2">leaving the guy alone the rest and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.810" end="00:13:32.589" style="s2">find other ways to express what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.759" end="00:13:35.800" style="s2">important to you rather than just okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.589" end="00:13:42.930" style="s2">go read Marx or go drill read the Milton</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.800" end="00:13:48.519" style="s2">or whatever Friedman it&#39;s kind of a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.930" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">to push back mm-hmm it and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.519" end="00:13:54.310" style="s2">of the things that has often troubled me</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:56.470" style="s2">in the in the discussions and I did not</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.310" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">grow up I mean I mainly grew up in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.470" end="00:14:05.019" style="s2">States but a lot in Latin America as</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">well so there were several more or less</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.019" end="00:14:12.069" style="s2">successful attempts but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:15.550" style="s2">things that he did say that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.069" end="00:14:17.649" style="s2">almost always excluded from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.550" end="00:14:23.050" style="s2">conversations was that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.649" end="00:14:24.600" style="s2">communism in his utopian ideal was</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.050" end="00:14:28.209" style="s2">something that was going to happen after</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.600" end="00:14:30.759" style="s2">capitalism after development it could</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.209" end="00:14:33.399" style="s2">never happen while economies were</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.759" end="00:14:37.410" style="s2">attempting to develop and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.399" end="00:14:41.110" style="s2">places where there have been atrocious</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.410" end="00:14:44.050" style="s2">misuses were economies that were very</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.110" end="00:14:45.699" style="s2">much attempting to develop and not where</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.050" end="00:14:48.730" style="s2">as yet when you look at you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.699" end="00:14:51.850" style="s2">northern the Nordic countries and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.730" end="00:14:52.899" style="s2">know who already had developed meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.850" end="00:14:54.279" style="s2">that they had certain types of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.899" end="00:14:59.009" style="s2">infrastructure and they had certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.279" end="00:15:02.610" style="s2">types of access to you know means of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.009" end="00:15:05.560" style="s2">international exchange that were not</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.610" end="00:15:08.410" style="s2">available to economies that didn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.560" end="00:15:11.139" style="s2">that that that yields a completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.410" end="00:15:12.910" style="s2">different outcome whereas economies that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.139" end="00:15:16.660" style="s2">you know anyway so this so it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.910" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">like by excluding the some of the key</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.660" end="00:15:28.279" style="s2">points you end up in conflating anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:32.029" style="s2">think I think that the the process</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.279" end="00:15:36.350" style="s2">of development matters and and hittin</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.029" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">and essentially we are talking about we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.350" end="00:15:39.230" style="s2">have to be talking about political</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.490" end="00:15:43.100" style="s2">economy I mean if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.230" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">Marxism and communism it&#39;s not just you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.100" end="00:15:50.149" style="s2">know the arts there or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:52.339" style="s2">so you know economic development matters</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.149" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">and in the countries and if we also</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.339" end="00:16:01.009" style="s2">think about the the Nordic countries</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.980" end="00:16:02.839" style="s2">they were also not as from to be okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.009" end="00:16:04.670" style="s2">this is going to make me sound like yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.839" end="00:16:07.670" style="s2">well anyway whatever they weren&#39;t as fun</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.670" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">to be colonial powers and the the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.670" end="00:16:12.589" style="s2">reason that that matters is that if you</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.940" end="00:17:33.289" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to define what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.289" end="00:17:38.390" style="s2">talking about no I mean in in economic</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.289" end="00:17:42.350" style="s2">terms often the way that okay I have</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.390" end="00:17:45.999" style="s2">absolutely no idea how</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.350" end="00:17:48.820" style="s2">this how these sorts of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.999" end="00:17:53.769" style="s2">would appear to you having grown up</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.820" end="00:18:02.570" style="s2">within that system I guess I&#39;m I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.769" end="00:18:05.929" style="s2">unfortunately entrenched in a us Linda</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.570" end="00:18:09.980" style="s2">Cole yeah well and just just a polemical</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.929" end="00:18:11.989" style="s2">debate as opposed to and and I just I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.980" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">see the edges where that tends to fall</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.989" end="00:18:17.029" style="s2">apart and the and the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:19.730" style="s2">almost always excluded so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.029" end="00:18:21.950" style="s2">like the you like most of the Americans</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.730" end="00:18:28.249" style="s2">that I speak to have very little</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.950" end="00:18:29.779" style="s2">understanding of how well trade I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.249" end="00:18:31.399" style="s2">just just just to talk about trade like</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.779" end="00:18:35.210" style="s2">they don&#39;t really understand what what</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.399" end="00:18:37.879" style="s2">that means I don&#39;t know you know well</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.210" end="00:18:39.590" style="s2">and I mentioned this in a text I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.879" end="00:18:45.409" style="s2">literally not gonna sleep for 48 hours</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.590" end="00:18:51.139" style="s2">and I&#39;m just like it&#39;s something would</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.409" end="00:18:57.080" style="s2">like this in my head it was like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.139" end="00:19:01.220" style="s2">my normal stance so forgot the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.080" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">of that sentence I trusted the intention</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.220" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">through your expression still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:19.190" style="s2">stress and we can pick up something</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:21.769" style="s2">about it some way I yield I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.190" end="00:19:23.450" style="s2">what to say either it&#39;s funny I&#39;m I also</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.769" end="00:19:25.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t get a lot of sleep last night and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.450" end="00:19:27.619" style="s2">I require a lot and then coming on and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.940" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">being discombobulated with the like</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.619" end="00:19:30.980" style="s2">sound being off and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:33.289" style="s2">thing I&#39;m like what are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.980" end="00:19:34.820" style="s2">right Marxism communism yep this is my</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.289" end="00:19:37.940" style="s2">third conversation so far this week on</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.820" end="00:19:39.799" style="s2">this and I thought they were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.940" end="00:19:41.119" style="s2">more divisive I thought that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.799" end="00:19:42.409" style="s2">planned them and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.119" end="00:19:43.850" style="s2">know how to handle a divisive</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.409" end="00:19:48.139" style="s2">conversation but we&#39;re gonna figure it</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.850" end="00:19:49.850" style="s2">out as we go and then they weren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.139" end="00:19:52.759" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been a lot of disagreement there</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.850" end="00:19:54.590" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been a lot of like I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.759" end="00:19:55.790" style="s2">gotten to the underlining like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.590" end="00:19:58.130" style="s2">the pieces we lie</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.790" end="00:20:01.250" style="s2">in it and we all admit that there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.130" end="00:20:04.910" style="s2">genocide and horrific account accounts</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.250" end="00:20:07.190" style="s2">for it and I also love our global world</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.910" end="00:20:09.410" style="s2">that like there are so many people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.190" end="00:20:11.270" style="s2">have experienced communism who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.410" end="00:20:13.850" style="s2">experienced capitalism who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.270" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">experienced moving from one to the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.850" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">and having parents that grew up in one</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:22.310" style="s2">and offered that that insight and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:24.800" style="s2">we live in that world where even if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.310" end="00:20:26.930" style="s2">have one experience there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.800" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">experiences that surround you and being</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.930" end="00:20:31.940" style="s2">open to that and hearing each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:33.590" style="s2">because you know 20 people we could have</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.940" end="00:20:35.420" style="s2">a conversation all having grown up in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.590" end="00:20:36.380" style="s2">communist country and they&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.420" end="00:20:38.300" style="s2">have a completely different experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.380" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">from that based on their family</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.300" end="00:20:43.010" style="s2">structure and their their their language</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:45.140" style="s2">around it right and they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.010" end="00:20:46.580" style="s2">their socioeconomic status even though</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.140" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t matter under communism</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.580" end="00:20:51.620" style="s2">right that of course it does right</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.480" style="s2">whether you grew up poor or whether your</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.620" end="00:20:57.710" style="s2">family had power whether you had access</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.480" end="00:21:02.870" style="s2">to those Goods and so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.710" end="00:21:05.090" style="s2">say that so if I get it correctly it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.870" end="00:21:08.360" style="s2">in a way a pleasant surprise that there</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.090" end="00:21:11.420" style="s2">was a lot of kind of shared ground and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.360" end="00:21:14.180" style="s2">also diversity of points of view still</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.420" end="00:21:19.070" style="s2">kind of presenting aspects of it but</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.180" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">still a lot of commonality yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.070" end="00:21:25.670" style="s2">feel like most people want to find the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:28.760" style="s2">good in all of the systems that we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.670" end="00:21:32.300" style="s2">tried so far on this planet and find a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.760" end="00:21:34.640" style="s2">way to create one that works for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.300" end="00:21:38.210" style="s2">individual for the group for the globe</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:39.800" style="s2">and if we can&#39;t do that right if game B</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.210" end="00:21:41.990" style="s2">can&#39;t come together people who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.800" end="00:21:43.370" style="s2">already drawn into game B and find that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.990" end="00:21:46.370" style="s2">common ground on something that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.370" end="00:21:47.750" style="s2">divisive like communism what hope do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.370" end="00:21:49.340" style="s2">have with the rest of the world who</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.750" end="00:21:51.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t even looking for it right who</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.340" end="00:21:54.350" style="s2">isn&#39;t even looking for that space but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.530" end="00:21:55.730" style="s2">think I&#39;m a this is my own bias being</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.350" end="00:21:59.450" style="s2">the person who&#39;s trying to create idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.730" end="00:22:01.790" style="s2">cafe that a lot of times it&#39;s the tool</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.450" end="00:22:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the tool we&#39;re using and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.790" end="00:22:05.720" style="s2">necessarily the people it&#39;s the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.160" end="00:22:06.950" style="s2">that people were typing out stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.720" end="00:22:09.590" style="s2">reading into what people were saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.950" end="00:22:13.250" style="s2">rather than visually see</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.590" end="00:22:16.630" style="s2">each other but also maybe this brought</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.250" end="00:22:23.030" style="s2">in the people who were more left-leaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.630" end="00:22:25.940" style="s2">hmm I don&#39;t know more centrist or</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.030" end="00:22:29.330" style="s2">centrist you had how many of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.940" end="00:22:33.740" style="s2">discussions three so far and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.330" end="00:22:35.150" style="s2">another one oh yeah I think so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.740" end="00:22:37.400" style="s2">there&#39;s been three of us needs which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.150" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">also kind of been because I find for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.400" end="00:22:41.900" style="s2">idea cafe although four is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:43.490" style="s2">going for five is the maximum three</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.900" end="00:22:45.580" style="s2">seems to be magic there is something</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.490" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">about three people having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.580" end="00:22:51.320" style="s2">in an idea cafe format that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:53.510" style="s2">gets heard and there&#39;s a lot of time to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.320" end="00:22:55.160" style="s2">share and talk right because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.510" end="00:22:56.300" style="s2">only half an hour and four people talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.160" end="00:22:58.520" style="s2">that&#39;s 20 minutes then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.300" end="00:23:00.410" style="s2">10-minute conversation and so you only</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.520" end="00:23:02.780" style="s2">have a tiny bit of that so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.410" end="00:23:07.820" style="s2">nice finding the iterations that work</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.780" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">for for this process I would like to try</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.820" end="00:23:13.730" style="s2">to tie in which I just heard you say and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">kind of maybe kind of make a category</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.730" end="00:23:23.270" style="s2">distinction it seems like there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:25.130" style="s2">levels or layers so first talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.270" end="00:23:28.790" style="s2">the implementation of some kind of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.130" end="00:23:32.180" style="s2">if you mentioned if we if we are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.790" end="00:23:34.850" style="s2">failing in our group to find kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.180" end="00:23:36.710" style="s2">common ground about it then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.850" end="00:23:39.770" style="s2">the rest people who are less engaged</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.710" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">they are maybe even less prepared for</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.770" end="00:23:46.700" style="s2">that because they haven&#39;t investigated</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:49.280" style="s2">that and and then kind of stepping back</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.700" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">if we can&#39;t even manage to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.280" end="00:23:55.250" style="s2">in a in a way you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:57.920" style="s2">constructively then there&#39;s even less</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.250" end="00:23:59.830" style="s2">hope and and then you are pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.920" end="00:24:02.150" style="s2">to the fact that it&#39;s maybe not so much</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.830" end="00:24:05.630" style="s2">that we are not capable of talking but</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.150" end="00:24:07.900" style="s2">that the medium itself is limiting us so</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.630" end="00:24:10.160" style="s2">in the Facebook post it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.900" end="00:24:12.020" style="s2">antagonistic while when we&#39;re joining</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.160" end="00:24:16.870" style="s2">and talking it&#39;s much easier because</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.020" end="00:24:20.360" style="s2">we&#39;re connecting properly so so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.870" end="00:24:21.779" style="s2">idea of a medium and I want to expand</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.360" end="00:24:24.859" style="s2">that even further</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.779" end="00:24:27.899" style="s2">just name the culture itself as a medium</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.859" end="00:24:33.779" style="s2">where we have where the medium shapes</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.899" end="00:24:36.479" style="s2">the message and and then obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.779" end="00:24:39.989" style="s2">bring our culture into Facebook or into</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.479" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">these conversations and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.989" end="00:24:46.200" style="s2">culture cultural shift naturally is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:48.389" style="s2">kind of a first topic for me how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.200" end="00:24:50.639" style="s2">change the culture so we would be able</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.389" end="00:24:54.450" style="s2">to have the conversations about how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.639" end="00:24:57.649" style="s2">implement the changes mm-hmm kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.450" end="00:24:59.940" style="s2">even talking about culture of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.649" end="00:25:02.700" style="s2">economical sense of culture but just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.940" end="00:25:04.830" style="s2">culture of relating just how we talk in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.700" end="00:25:06.570" style="s2">general with each other not only on</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.830" end="00:25:09.080" style="s2">Facebook but just in principle because</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.570" end="00:25:11.909" style="s2">there are prevalent programs around</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.080" end="00:25:15.479" style="s2">everywhere and they just get triggered</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.909" end="00:25:19.830" style="s2">by various topics that are more hot like</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.479" end="00:25:22.979" style="s2">hot potatoes to throw around but our</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.830" end="00:25:29.580" style="s2">attitudes towards behavior towards each</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.979" end="00:25:31.889" style="s2">other and and maybe also not seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.580" end="00:25:36.619" style="s2">culture for what it is not recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.889" end="00:25:39.059" style="s2">the effect that it has on us mmm the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.619" end="00:25:42.179" style="s2">part of this is that we recognize each</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.059" end="00:25:44.580" style="s2">other as embodied people right we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.179" end="00:25:47.820" style="s2">just letters on a screen like we each</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.580" end="00:25:50.820" style="s2">have faces and there we have and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.820" end="00:25:53.879" style="s2">that that that is something that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.820" end="00:25:57.149" style="s2">very you know ultimately concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.879" end="00:26:02.249" style="s2">you know or are we do do we understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.149" end="00:26:05.369" style="s2">and and some of my work is actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.249" end="00:26:08.460" style="s2">conducting focus groups so I am I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.369" end="00:26:11.519" style="s2">these sorts of forum a lot a lot a lot a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.460" end="00:26:15.419" style="s2">lot and and I&#39;m on all sorts of topics</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.519" end="00:26:18.059" style="s2">from aids to politics to to you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.419" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">many different things and on the one</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.059" end="00:26:22.019" style="s2">hand and and often they&#39;re people that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:24.989" style="s2">are like behind behind a mirror behind</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.019" end="00:26:27.960" style="s2">me and there and and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.989" end="00:26:31.169" style="s2">don&#39;t do these sorts of things a lot are</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.960" end="00:26:33.389" style="s2">always shocked by what people will say</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.169" end="00:26:34.890" style="s2">openly with each other you know people</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.389" end="00:26:37.710" style="s2">who don&#39;t know each other or will</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.890" end="00:26:40.260" style="s2">to say when they actually see each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.710" end="00:26:43.320" style="s2">as opposed to you know that undefined</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.260" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">other or the projected other the you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.320" end="00:26:45.750" style="s2">know that that&#39;s sort of thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:49.260" style="s2">think that there really is something</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.750" end="00:26:52.410" style="s2">about you know us as beings in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.260" end="00:26:54.900" style="s2">relating that is it gives a lot of cause</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.410" end="00:26:58.290" style="s2">for hope you know when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.900" end="00:27:05.250" style="s2">reduced to stereotypes it&#39;s much easier</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.290" end="00:27:09.000" style="s2">to to project idiocy and or you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.250" end="00:27:12.360" style="s2">vile intentions or whatever it is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.000" end="00:27:14.340" style="s2">just inconsiderateness like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.360" end="00:27:19.560" style="s2">care about me maybe you&#39;re a good person</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.340" end="00:27:23.310" style="s2">but you just don&#39;t care about yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.560" end="00:27:24.690" style="s2">mean I think this space is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.310" end="00:27:26.790" style="s2">hoping I mean this is the space I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.690" end="00:27:28.680" style="s2">plane and this is like try to become how</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.790" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">do we create social media that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.680" end="00:27:32.010" style="s2">designed for connection real connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:34.710" style="s2">we&#39;re not trying to troll we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.010" end="00:27:36.540" style="s2">trying to increase the divisive nough so</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.710" end="00:27:39.090" style="s2">it increases profit we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.540" end="00:27:40.710" style="s2">trying to increase connection and bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.090" end="00:27:43.080" style="s2">people together and find that common</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.710" end="00:27:44.790" style="s2">ground and part of that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.080" end="00:27:45.000" style="s2">we need to have conflict to figure that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.790" end="00:27:46.860" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.000" end="00:27:48.660" style="s2">alright they&#39;re like this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.860" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">conflict enough like it&#39;s like how do I</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.660" end="00:27:53.460" style="s2">like but which is beautiful like I love</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:55.140" style="s2">that it hasn&#39;t been but I&#39;m like but I</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.460" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">was looking for a little bit to be able</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.140" end="00:27:58.110" style="s2">to see what that was like and have it</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">fall apart so you could build it back up</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.110" end="00:28:05.010" style="s2">and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:07.350" style="s2">ok and so we have about two more minutes</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.010" end="00:28:08.910" style="s2">before the 30 minute mark everyone wants</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.350" end="00:28:11.130" style="s2">to kind of wrap up their their thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.910" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">and then we can stop recording and vote</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.130" end="00:28:18.780" style="s2">slash whatever you go by the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:20.610" style="s2">so maybe maybe I&#39;ll start my wrap-up</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.780" end="00:28:23.070" style="s2">would be that at least from this</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.610" end="00:28:25.980" style="s2">conversation it seems that the topic</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.070" end="00:28:27.810" style="s2">isn&#39;t really maybe not not that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.980" end="00:28:31.470" style="s2">an issue but it&#39;s like not the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.810" end="00:28:33.780" style="s2">issue and it just becomes a red flag in</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.470" end="00:28:37.470" style="s2">the conversations about the bigger issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.780" end="00:28:39.480" style="s2">that somebody is not caring about me</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.470" end="00:28:41.220" style="s2">enough and introducing some ideas which</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.480" end="00:28:42.660" style="s2">might penetrate my boundaries or</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.220" end="00:28:46.440" style="s2">whatever and therefore I need to step up</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.660" end="00:28:48.840" style="s2">and defend whatever I care about because</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.440" end="00:28:51.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t trust this space to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.840" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">safe enough for me I suspect that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.000" end="00:28:56.909" style="s2">kind of a one of the primary things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:29:00.809" style="s2">it the if it&#39;s a certain topic arises</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.909" end="00:29:04.169" style="s2">it&#39;s a signal for me to kind of strain</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.809" end="00:29:14.010" style="s2">myself and start go on a offensive</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.169" end="00:29:16.110" style="s2">defense and and that I guess in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:19.140" style="s2">what you just mentioned in terms of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.110" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">creation of the of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.140" end="00:29:22.980" style="s2">it being a bit too easy here not not</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:25.770" style="s2">enough of a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.980" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">maybe the purpose of this not being a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.770" end="00:29:30.830" style="s2">challenge is to actually I just thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">it might be just to give you hope that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.830" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">actually you don&#39;t even need a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.120" end="00:29:36.990" style="s2">maybe maybe it&#39;s better just to learn</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:39.840" style="s2">not to see the challenge in the text</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.990" end="00:29:43.380" style="s2">world as well and just perceive it as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:45.870" style="s2">well the friendly person that I am sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.380" end="00:29:48.390" style="s2">I would connect to on that visual level</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.870" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">and direct conversation is just</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.390" end="00:29:53.399" style="s2">communicating in a way that I need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:55.789" style="s2">learn to understand as actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.399" end="00:30:04.440" style="s2">that everything is okay we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.789" end="00:30:07.919" style="s2">like that thank you thank you I think I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.440" end="00:30:10.200" style="s2">like that I like um I know for me my own</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.919" end="00:30:12.600" style="s2">interpersonal work I need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.200" end="00:30:13.980" style="s2">how to do that with text it&#39;s easier for</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.600" end="00:30:16.710" style="s2">me to do that with video it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.980" end="00:30:17.909" style="s2">easy with text both I read into my own</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.710" end="00:30:19.950" style="s2">wording like what are they gonna read</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.909" end="00:30:21.539" style="s2">into it and trying to find 15 layers and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.950" end="00:30:23.429" style="s2">answer them before they even ask it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.539" end="00:30:25.580" style="s2">then I do read into other people when</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.429" end="00:30:27.720" style="s2">they&#39;re typing I don&#39;t assume</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.580" end="00:30:30.149" style="s2">intelligence and kindness and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.720" end="00:30:32.970" style="s2">sovereignty in the same way I do on</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.970" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">Glenda&#39;s yeah I wonder if it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.830" end="00:30:41.700" style="s2">through text I you know without without</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:43.500" style="s2">seeing someone I mean at least in</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.700" end="00:30:45.480" style="s2">facebook you can sometimes see a picture</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.500" end="00:30:52.380" style="s2">of somebody so you you remember there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.480" end="00:30:53.850" style="s2">a person but and not just a threat yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.380" end="00:30:56.279" style="s2">I guess there there are a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.850" end="00:31:00.330" style="s2">people in the in the in the wider world</p>
