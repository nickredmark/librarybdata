<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:06.890" style="s2">all right hello YouTube joined by Mark</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.330" end="00:00:09.690" style="s2">Fraser and Eric we&#39;re gonna discuss</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.890" end="00:00:11.550" style="s2">infectious disease and what we can come</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.690" end="00:00:15.240" style="s2">up with or a solution within the next</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.550" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">hour so for the first 15 minutes we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">gonna discuss what we feel is currently</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">happening what we think and feel is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">currently happening and that&#39;s both good</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:26.609" style="s2">and bad in the infectious disease base</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:28.199" style="s2">so if anyone would like to start I</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.609" end="00:00:29.580" style="s2">actually wrote notes out because this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">the one that I haven&#39;t spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.580" end="00:00:34.430" style="s2">time thinking about unlike every other</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.430" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">I&#39;ll just contribute one small notion of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">the start there&#39;s just the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">there are two separate things here right</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:48.629" style="s2">there&#39;s a health of people this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:51.059" style="s2">one thing and then there&#39;s the strain on</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">systems is the other part of it right</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">and obviously these two things are</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">linked but in many ways there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">conflicts with each other right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">good example currently would be</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">somewhere like Italy who has basically I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">understand shut down the entire country</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">I mean the message is everybody stay</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">home pretty much basically understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">its message Italy so and and in one way</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">of looking at that might be to say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">you know alright we know the economy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:23.369" style="s2">gonna get slammed here but paramount to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">our concerns are the well-being of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.369" end="00:01:27.110" style="s2">citizens and not overwhelming the health</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">care system right whereas in America</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.110" end="00:01:31.560" style="s2">it&#39;s been pretty much the opposite you</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:34.259" style="s2">know go about business as usual playing</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.560" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">it down it&#39;s no big deal that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.259" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s so that I think that and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">would read that as their primary concern</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">is not collapsing the stock market you</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">know I mean not not not creating you</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">know not creating too much damage to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:55.460" style="s2">economy in the short term so yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:55.460" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my early view on it</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.720" end="00:02:03.870" style="s2">well I&#39;ve I&#39;ve gotten thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.410" end="00:02:08.630" style="s2">headlong in into a number of groups that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.870" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">are exploring steps that people can take</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.630" end="00:02:16.410" style="s2">individually and this households and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">with their neighbors and then looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.410" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">into also opportunities for innovation</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">in the way we&#39;re approaching this in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:34.350" style="s2">more systematic form and so I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:37.350" style="s2">want to get too much into the weeds but</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.350" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">I think some broad themes for me are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.350" end="00:02:44.040" style="s2">way we&#39;re dealing it now has been very</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:47.880" style="s2">dependent on sort of gatekeepers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.040" end="00:02:51.350" style="s2">arbiters who in the case of the US and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.880" end="00:02:55.370" style="s2">in what the state of Washington CDC</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.350" end="00:03:00.060" style="s2">prevented because of FDA rules prevented</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.370" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">state from innovating to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">their their test kits when the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">bottlenecks started to be clear that CDC</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">had dropped the ball there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:15.480" style="s2">essentially an edict saying we will not</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">allow efforts by by state governments</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.480" end="00:03:25.010" style="s2">and by private providers to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:29.190" style="s2">solutions and that contrasted horribly</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.010" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">with what South Korea did which was</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.190" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">almost from day one say look we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:38.550" style="s2">recognize we&#39;re gonna need all hands on</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2">deck so part of their success in getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.550" end="00:03:45.450" style="s2">detection of of the problem was that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.600" end="00:03:49.019" style="s2">they did encourage a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.450" end="00:03:51.330" style="s2">players to to innovate and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.019" end="00:03:54.300" style="s2">responded in days where we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.330" end="00:03:56.070" style="s2">essentially a flat-footed for many weeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.300" end="00:04:00.440" style="s2">and in the case of washed state of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.070" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">Washington it was a state decision to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.440" end="00:04:08.460" style="s2">defy this rule and they went ahead with</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:10.220" style="s2">their own test kits and because of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.460" end="00:04:12.370" style="s2">on their</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.220" end="00:04:17.180" style="s2">this disease which already had galloped</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.370" end="00:04:19.670" style="s2">far more than a Troodon did finally get</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.180" end="00:04:24.500" style="s2">resolved through this this initiative at</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.670" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">state level so my my hope is we segue</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.500" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">later into solutions if we can see ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.270" end="00:04:34.670" style="s2">to encourage innovations in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:39.500" style="s2">breakthroughs on in a full spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.670" end="00:04:41.890" style="s2">fields by opening this just a month to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.500" end="00:04:44.360" style="s2">innovation but also introducing</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.890" end="00:04:47.660" style="s2">accountability and incentives which are</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.360" end="00:04:49.160" style="s2">sorely lacking in the failures on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.660" end="00:04:52.580" style="s2">that we&#39;ve seen from the central</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.160" end="00:04:55.060" style="s2">approach so that that&#39;s my view um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.580" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a controversial one I</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.060" end="00:05:00.500" style="s2">think for me I was more of my notes here</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2">more concentrating on just um infectious</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.500" end="00:05:06.140" style="s2">disease in general that right now in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:08.060" style="s2">society we live a very global society</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.140" end="00:05:09.800" style="s2">people jet-set around the world all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:11.270" style="s2">time no one quarantines we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.800" end="00:05:13.010" style="s2">any we have screening going on to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.270" end="00:05:16.190" style="s2">airplanes for terrorist reasons we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.010" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">nothing coming off of of coming off of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.190" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">airplanes including places once they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:22.700" style="s2">known that the corona virus was there</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:24.410" style="s2">even in I&#39;m about to go to the airport</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.700" end="00:05:25.970" style="s2">tour and I&#39;m sure they have no screening</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.410" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">coming off they&#39;ve been people who come</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.970" end="00:05:30.530" style="s2">back from Italy in China into County the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">United States who they basically if they</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.530" end="00:05:35.180" style="s2">do anything give them a pamphlet like</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">here&#39;s how you self quarantine and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.180" end="00:05:40.850" style="s2">is ridiculous with what level we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:42.470" style="s2">right now our doctors aren&#39;t design</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.850" end="00:05:43.850" style="s2">aren&#39;t really taught how to think</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.470" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">outside the box they&#39;re not designed</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.850" end="00:05:48.830" style="s2">they&#39;re not taught how to innovate when</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:50.780" style="s2">something comes up like this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.830" end="00:05:52.550" style="s2">expecting a memo and so they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.780" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">know how to deal with this so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.550" end="00:05:57.050" style="s2">been many many stories of doctors who</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.310" end="00:05:58.460" style="s2">have somebody come in with a fever with</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.050" end="00:06:01.790" style="s2">the symptoms who are like what we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.460" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">test you but also like they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.790" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">the resources to give the person they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:09.110" style="s2">not gloved up there don&#39;t have masks on</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:10.460" style="s2">they don&#39;t and they don&#39;t put into place</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.110" end="00:06:11.690" style="s2">anything that would stop the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.460" end="00:06:13.340" style="s2">infectious disease and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.690" end="00:06:16.580" style="s2">there&#39;s the misinformation and media</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.340" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">that because they&#39;ve been crying wolf so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.580" end="00:06:21.229" style="s2">much everything is is the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:22.910" style="s2">world everything is in apocalypse but</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.229" end="00:06:23.540" style="s2">now that we there might actually be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.910" end="00:06:25.820" style="s2">wolf</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.540" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">I listen to it in time in those that did</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.820" end="00:06:30.590" style="s2">there&#39;s like simultaneously this</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">overreaction and under-reaction and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.590" end="00:06:35.960" style="s2">don&#39;t trust our I don&#39;t trust our our</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.520" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">institutions and I think many of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.960" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">don&#39;t trust our institutions and those</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:41.180" style="s2">that do are now seen that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:42.830" style="s2">of cracks in the system that our</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.180" end="00:06:44.120" style="s2">governments don&#39;t know how to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.830" end="00:06:45.740" style="s2">things like this because they have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.120" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">deal with this is both an illness and an</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.740" end="00:06:49.310" style="s2">economic thing and how do they piss off</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:50.600" style="s2">one side to do another what if they shut</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.310" end="00:06:52.670" style="s2">things down too early and hurt their</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.600" end="00:06:55.490" style="s2">economy what if they do and it&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.670" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">these top-down approaches that were also</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.050" end="00:07:18.650" style="s2">that are that are volunteer-driven do</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.730" end="00:07:22.580" style="s2">the things like self quarantine and on</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.650" end="00:07:26.330" style="s2">and not going out and also coming out</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.580" end="00:07:29.630" style="s2">are a lot of potential solutions like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.330" end="00:07:31.700" style="s2">vitamin C and vitamin D and 95 G or</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.630" end="00:07:34.940" style="s2">whatever the solutions are we&#39;ve got no</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.940" end="00:07:37.940" style="s2">which ones could have a grain of truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:40.760" style="s2">but maybe they&#39;re not the place we spend</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.940" end="00:07:42.170" style="s2">our resources there especially when</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.760" end="00:07:44.420" style="s2">medicines not being available because</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.170" end="00:07:48.100" style="s2">it&#39;s being made in China if vitamin C is</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.420" end="00:07:50.870" style="s2">available and the profit motive to have</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.870" end="00:07:55.910" style="s2">vitamins B the solution is absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.910" end="00:08:00.110" style="s2">message that they don&#39;t want you to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.460" end="00:08:01.340" style="s2">right like heaven forbid you actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.110" end="00:08:03.140" style="s2">cure the supply-demand see maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.340" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">could do that with with other things as</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.140" end="00:08:08.750" style="s2">well but the funding isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:11.660" style="s2">actually in you know more healthy times</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.750" end="00:08:13.580" style="s2">look at what can keep us healthiest what</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.660" end="00:08:17.660" style="s2">how do we get everyone an adequate diet</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.580" end="00:08:20.230" style="s2">I love all of those things so those are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.660" end="00:08:20.230" style="s2">a bit of my notes</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.610" end="00:08:34.960" style="s2">no matter the economic thing takes many</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.830" end="00:08:37.180" style="s2">forms one of the ways in which companies</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.960" end="00:08:42.190" style="s2">have driven towards greater economic</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.180" end="00:08:44.950" style="s2">efficiencies is is this very very short</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.190" end="00:08:46.930" style="s2">response time supply chain kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.950" end="00:08:48.580" style="s2">right where they&#39;re you know everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.930" end="00:08:50.200" style="s2">living on knowing that there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.580" end="00:08:52.750" style="s2">delivery coming tomorrow right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.200" end="00:08:54.250" style="s2">no redundancy there&#39;s no reserves at</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.750" end="00:08:57.400" style="s2">lots of stages in the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.250" end="00:08:59.290" style="s2">there&#39;s absolutely no redundancy and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.400" end="00:09:01.300" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take very much it&#39;s brittle</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:05.770" style="s2">and fragile in all sorts of ways doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.300" end="00:09:11.170" style="s2">take very much for it to crack right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.770" end="00:09:13.930" style="s2">I think this points to an area of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.170" end="00:09:18.790" style="s2">potential innovation and hope again if</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.930" end="00:09:22.150" style="s2">if the system is flexible enough to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.790" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">allow for experiments one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.150" end="00:09:29.890" style="s2">that might be done by virtual cohorts</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:32.589" style="s2">for example on is to say ok we are going</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.890" end="00:09:36.280" style="s2">to test the following it can be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.589" end="00:09:40.780" style="s2">front loading of selenium and zinc and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.280" end="00:09:43.620" style="s2">vitamin C and so forth vitamin D in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.780" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">following ways and they&#39;re these these</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.620" end="00:09:47.800" style="s2">self-organizing swarms could our</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:50.260" style="s2">research and they could create their own</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.800" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">clusters and groups and people that had</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.260" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">different ideas in terms of good way</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.470" end="00:10:00.490" style="s2">ways to manage risks and good protocols</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:05.339" style="s2">and it would not be I think that hard if</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:09.940" style="s2">we had biosensors Arduino you know has</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.339" end="00:10:12.910" style="s2">$8 $10 devices on Amazon they can</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.940" end="00:10:17.320" style="s2">measure temperature changes in a person</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.910" end="00:10:20.260" style="s2">you know link them up with with with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.320" end="00:10:24.610" style="s2">know Bluetooth and and have these kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.260" end="00:10:27.250" style="s2">of tracking systems so if cohorts were</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.610" end="00:10:29.770" style="s2">to do that virtually and there were to</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.250" end="00:10:32.380" style="s2">be ways to track in data vaults</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.770" end="00:10:35.500" style="s2">basically and anonymize and so forth um</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.380" end="00:10:36.910" style="s2">that would be a way for the system to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.500" end="00:10:39.190" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.910" end="00:10:43.510" style="s2">without going through these absurd</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.190" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">multi-year hurdles of validating what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.510" end="00:10:49.750" style="s2">going to be allowed to be offered as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">treatment so I think this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.750" end="00:10:54.030" style="s2">approach also with actual communities</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.910" end="00:10:58.900" style="s2">there are tens of millions of households</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.030" end="00:11:01.980" style="s2">in Asia in Europe in in North America</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.900" end="00:11:04.690" style="s2">who are members of condo associations</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.980" end="00:11:08.580" style="s2">homeowner associations housing</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.690" end="00:11:13.060" style="s2">cooperatives all of which have very well</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.580" end="00:11:17.710" style="s2">set up often system for deciding on what</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.060" end="00:11:20.890" style="s2">good practices people should have - in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.710" end="00:11:27.370" style="s2">everyone&#39;s interest to make it a safe</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.890" end="00:11:29.650" style="s2">place and thriving place to be so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.370" end="00:11:34.470" style="s2">these organizations were to have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.650" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">flexibility to partner with virtual</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.470" end="00:11:41.890" style="s2">healthcare providers for example on K</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">Health is an Israeli company that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.890" end="00:11:50.350" style="s2">doing telemedicine with live chats with</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:54.010" style="s2">physicians for $20 if it were possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.350" end="00:11:57.790" style="s2">for it for these groups to do what</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.010" end="00:12:00.610" style="s2">mutual associations did before the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.790" end="00:12:02.980" style="s2">the New Deal and have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.610" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">have bids from different telemedicine</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.980" end="00:12:10.870" style="s2">providers who can offer prescriptions</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.610" end="00:12:14.590" style="s2">and then for these associations to set</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.870" end="00:12:17.650" style="s2">up systems for delivery of prescribed</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.590" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">medicines to their to actually the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.650" end="00:12:26.050" style="s2">individual divorce of people who are are</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:30.040" style="s2">now sick this would um ease a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.050" end="00:12:33.880" style="s2">strain on the icy use and others which</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.040" end="00:12:36.700" style="s2">now have very little and the frontline</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.880" end="00:12:40.330" style="s2">doctors where where we&#39;re where people</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.700" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">are coming in and spreading and adding</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.330" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">to the viral loads on the frontline</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:49.480" style="s2">providers who are totally ill-equipped</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.610" end="00:12:51.400" style="s2">so I I think there&#39;s a huge potential if</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.480" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">these kind of partnerships where the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.400" end="00:12:57.730" style="s2">profit motive of the insurance companies</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:13:00.730" style="s2">is to keep people you know from from</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.730" end="00:13:03.520" style="s2">getting sick over life insurance</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.730" end="00:13:06.520" style="s2">companies if there were not flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.520" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">for these contractual associations in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.520" end="00:13:16.030" style="s2">virtual cohorts to start making their</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:18.640" style="s2">best guesses of what is a response and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.030" end="00:13:20.950" style="s2">then sharing the data on what works I</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.640" end="00:13:27.910" style="s2">think that would be a win and Omni win</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.950" end="00:13:29.380" style="s2">all around we like how many wins we do</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.910" end="00:13:32.260" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s a natural segue into</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.380" end="00:13:35.190" style="s2">the utopian part I wanna be like Omni</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.260" end="00:13:37.960" style="s2">win society when we live in a world that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.190" end="00:13:39.340" style="s2">and it we are still don&#39;t need to match</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.960" end="00:13:42.250" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to agree on what that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.340" end="00:13:44.620" style="s2">actually looks like but giving your your</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.250" end="00:13:46.900" style="s2">your vision of what a future that worked</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.620" end="00:13:49.510" style="s2">for you and you thought would worked for</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.900" end="00:13:51.190" style="s2">a society would look like in however</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.510" end="00:13:56.230" style="s2">long you need that to be five ten</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.190" end="00:14:00.010" style="s2">hundred years in the future so I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.230" end="00:14:02.830" style="s2">again some notes here this isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.010" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">a vision but it&#39;s just like more of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.830" end="00:14:09.130" style="s2">way to think about it so using the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:12.940" style="s2">coronavirus as a specific example in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.130" end="00:14:15.280" style="s2">terms of threat to health from what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.940" end="00:14:16.990" style="s2">understand in healthy populations that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.280" end="00:14:18.700" style="s2">have access to health care blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.990" end="00:14:20.320" style="s2">blah blah the death rate is like less</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.700" end="00:14:23.200" style="s2">than noir point five percent what</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:26.650" style="s2">Telly&#39;s are up is the old people and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.200" end="00:14:28.330" style="s2">poor responses and and so on so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.650" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">to me that it would be nice if we could</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.330" end="00:14:32.890" style="s2">all just relax there&#39;s a disease going</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:34.450" style="s2">around some of you were gonna get sick</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.890" end="00:14:36.310" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna spend a few days in bed you</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.450" end="00:14:38.470" style="s2">can have a bit of a sniffle most of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.310" end="00:14:40.690" style="s2">are gonna be absolutely fine right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.470" end="00:14:42.250" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna go it&#39;s gonna spread like</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.690" end="00:14:43.750" style="s2">wildfire this time because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.250" end="00:14:46.090" style="s2">immunity in the population but in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.750" end="00:14:49.470" style="s2">future there will be widespread immunity</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.090" end="00:14:52.330" style="s2">and that will contain you know future</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.470" end="00:14:55.620" style="s2">incarnations of it so the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.330" end="00:14:58.690" style="s2">cannot do that right that we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.620" end="00:15:00.730" style="s2">for various reasons right there no one&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:17:33.350" end="00:17:37.250" style="s2">people who are sick and the more were</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.180" end="00:17:40.310" style="s2">able to if we want to live in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.250" end="00:17:42.740" style="s2">communities that are obviously isolated</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.310" end="00:17:44.990" style="s2">and that&#39;s the wrong word but if I work</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.740" end="00:17:47.690" style="s2">I&#39;m part of a community right now and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.990" end="00:17:49.190" style="s2">there&#39;s four or five nurses all who work</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.690" end="00:17:51.290" style="s2">different places some of the kids go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.190" end="00:17:52.850" style="s2">the one local public school some go to</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.850" end="00:17:57.050" style="s2">city everyone you know has different</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.170" end="00:17:58.910" style="s2">places of worship these are that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.050" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">we spread it before I mean like nurses</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.910" end="00:18:02.390" style="s2">on the front line and they&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:04.130" style="s2">it back so being able to have in cases</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.390" end="00:18:05.990" style="s2">like this a community where your doctors</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.130" end="00:18:08.180" style="s2">and nurses are within that community and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.990" end="00:18:09.620" style="s2">it&#39;s and your kids all go to the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.180" end="00:18:11.860" style="s2">school but there&#39;s an amazing school</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.620" end="00:18:14.230" style="s2">that deals with them as individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.860" end="00:18:16.490" style="s2">everyone has access to adequate</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.230" end="00:18:19.070" style="s2">nutrition so they&#39;re at their healthiest</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.490" end="00:18:20.390" style="s2">peak without dictating what that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.070" end="00:18:21.950" style="s2">actually is right and I don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.390" end="00:18:24.470" style="s2">take your burgers fries away from you</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.840" end="00:24:49.500" style="s2">especially I mean okay again in the</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.710" end="00:25:00.450" style="s2">asymptomatic right and so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.930" end="00:25:02.220" style="s2">only way is to simply test everyone as</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.450" end="00:25:04.380" style="s2">soon as there is an outbreak you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.220" end="00:25:06.660" style="s2">know you create a quarantine zone and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.380" end="00:25:07.830" style="s2">you test everybody in that quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.660" end="00:25:09.030" style="s2">zone you know it doesn&#39;t matter where</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.830" end="00:25:10.470" style="s2">they got symptoms or not doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.030" end="00:25:12.630" style="s2">who they&#39;ve been in contact with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.470" end="00:25:13.920" style="s2">know blanket if you&#39;re serious about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.630" end="00:25:16.260" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s not without its</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.920" end="00:25:19.320" style="s2">problems also but it seems to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.260" end="00:25:22.500" style="s2">the only way no I think it&#39;s great point</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.320" end="00:25:24.660" style="s2">and a great point and I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.500" end="00:25:28.680" style="s2">partner part of the question is do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.660" end="00:25:31.140" style="s2">wait for a canonical testing which has</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.680" end="00:25:34.230" style="s2">an advantage of having apples to apples</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.140" end="00:25:36.840" style="s2">comparisons but it comes at a cost if</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.230" end="00:25:39.480" style="s2">it&#39;s bungled of of leaving you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.840" end="00:25:42.750" style="s2">millions of tens of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.480" end="00:25:45.900" style="s2">at risk when they need not be versus</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.750" end="00:25:50.130" style="s2">having a system in the case of France if</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.900" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">you&#39;re putting up a building in Paris on</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.130" end="00:25:58.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t get the the municipal</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.960" end="00:26:20.670" style="s2">think if we if we had a way for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.660" end="00:26:23.040" style="s2">insurance company is particularly life</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.670" end="00:26:26.220" style="s2">insurance companies to have skin in the</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.550" end="00:26:35.250" style="s2">way of testing I think their incentives</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.940" end="00:26:38.280" style="s2">are all lined up to get that out early</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.250" end="00:26:42.450" style="s2">and make sure it&#39;s effective and there</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.280" end="00:26:46.230" style="s2">could be enough learning in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.450" end="00:26:49.770" style="s2">which which of these tasks that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.230" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">rolled out quickly work best and some</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.660" end="00:27:05.790" style="s2">to me is a healthier or more resilient</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.740" end="00:27:09.480" style="s2">path and then just praying that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.790" end="00:27:13.740" style="s2">this bureaucracy is going to get it get</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.480" end="00:27:16.920" style="s2">its system up and at a world-class level</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.920" end="00:27:23.280" style="s2">catastrophe is ensued by having this</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.570" end="00:27:46.710" style="s2">very keen to assure people it&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.730" end="00:27:50.270" style="s2">answers and then trillions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.710" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">later you know oh I guess it didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.270" end="00:27:56.700" style="s2">and no accountability for that so I I</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:27:59.370" style="s2">would love to see a system that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.700" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">experiments and innovates system-wide</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.630" end="00:28:14.160" style="s2">is a theme which we come back to again</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:15.500" style="s2">and again and again in our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.160" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:20.610" style="s2">absolutely the trust is built on</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:22.590" style="s2">transparency right and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.610" end="00:28:24.200" style="s2">look at what people said and look at</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.289" end="00:28:31.609" style="s2">they&#39;re also though like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:32.989" style="s2">narrowing why I&#39;m gonna say pants but</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.609" end="00:28:34.669" style="s2">like too much risk we put on</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.669" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason every the shit</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.359" end="00:28:41.690" style="s2">hits the fan is because they know they</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:43.399" style="s2">can get sued they know these things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.690" end="00:28:44.869" style="s2">gonna happen so so I&#39;m not gonna put a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.399" end="00:28:46.730" style="s2">test out there what if I get sued for</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.869" end="00:28:48.649" style="s2">putting this test out there right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.730" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">being able to have a system that is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.649" end="00:28:52.429" style="s2">listen we&#39;re in the infancy of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:55.369" style="s2">disease if you can come up with it with</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.429" end="00:28:57.169" style="s2">a test and you know we&#39;re going like we</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.369" end="00:28:58.429" style="s2">want to test all of them to see how how</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.169" end="00:29:00.769" style="s2">positive they are but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.429" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">fallback on you as long as you are</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.769" end="00:29:04.759" style="s2">transparent and open about what what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.220" style="s2">how accurate right you&#39;re not fudging</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.759" end="00:29:09.409" style="s2">the data you&#39;re not doing those things</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.220" end="00:29:11.269" style="s2">but having a system like right now when</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.409" end="00:29:13.340" style="s2">I did my video this morning on all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.269" end="00:29:15.169" style="s2">the different sectors of society and how</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.340" end="00:29:17.419" style="s2">were kind of seeing them break apart and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.169" end="00:29:19.100" style="s2">one huge one is business there are tons</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.419" end="00:29:20.600" style="s2">and tons of people businesses that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.100" end="00:29:21.980" style="s2">going under including the big ones but</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.600" end="00:29:23.749" style="s2">now they&#39;ve been bailed out by 1.5</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.980" end="00:29:25.399" style="s2">trillion dollars so it&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.749" end="00:29:27.409" style="s2">small ones that go under and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.399" end="00:29:29.539" style="s2">part of that is that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.409" end="00:29:31.399" style="s2">start businesses are those that are that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.539" end="00:29:34.190" style="s2">are higher rent that have a higher risk</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.399" end="00:29:36.169" style="s2">tolerance someone like me with a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.190" end="00:29:37.519" style="s2">low risk tolerance isn&#39;t never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.169" end="00:29:40.249" style="s2">start a business where I&#39;m gonna take on</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.519" end="00:29:43.519" style="s2">all that risk but if I did I would know</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.249" end="00:29:46.639" style="s2">a contingency for every scenario and our</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.519" end="00:29:48.499" style="s2">issue is we prop like business being</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.639" end="00:29:52.220" style="s2">incentivized to make profit and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.499" end="00:29:56.570" style="s2">cover up their mistakes is like not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.220" end="00:29:58.580" style="s2">great culture for having us innovate in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.570" end="00:30:00.830" style="s2">a way that is gonna bring the best ideas</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.580" end="00:30:02.929" style="s2">to market and so I think we&#39;re at where</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.830" end="00:30:05.619" style="s2">exactly at the half an hour mark so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.929" end="00:30:08.809" style="s2">can talk about the the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.619" end="00:30:13.220" style="s2">which for me is what what you touched on</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.809" end="00:30:14.629" style="s2">mark on the how do we get solutions into</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.220" end="00:30:16.759" style="s2">the world without the medium to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.629" end="00:30:18.889" style="s2">through the marketplace without them</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.759" end="00:30:21.230" style="s2">needing to if you have an idea whether</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.889" end="00:30:22.369" style="s2">it&#39;s the like just the sparkle of an</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.230" end="00:30:23.869" style="s2">idea that you&#39;re because this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.369" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">brand-new you were thinking about Cove</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.869" end="00:30:27.980" style="s2">in 19 for months ago and think like why</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:31.489" style="s2">were you thinking about these things</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.980" end="00:30:33.169" style="s2">right so if it&#39;s a new idea how do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.489" end="00:30:34.639" style="s2">help you progress it how do we test it</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.169" end="00:30:36.259" style="s2">how do we make sure it&#39;s the lowest risk</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.639" end="00:30:37.149" style="s2">possible that&#39;s still going forward</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.259" end="00:30:38.200" style="s2">because that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.149" end="00:30:46.570" style="s2">what our governments have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.200" end="00:30:48.519" style="s2">is um like action and inaction right</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.570" end="00:30:51.029" style="s2">they if for inaction they don&#39;t get as</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.519" end="00:30:54.309" style="s2">much trouble as taking the wrong action</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.029" end="00:30:56.379" style="s2">including them completely fucking up</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.309" end="00:30:57.940" style="s2">over the last few weeks and not doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.379" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">stuff soon enough not doing it so now</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.940" end="00:31:01.269" style="s2">they&#39;re it&#39;s more spread they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:02.889" style="s2">gonna get us in much trouble of that if</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.269" end="00:31:05.379" style="s2">they had shut down and then it hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.889" end="00:31:08.919" style="s2">been a big deal like so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.379" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">say is this safe enough that it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.919" end="00:31:12.429" style="s2">than what we are currently doing which</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:14.289" style="s2">is nothing and then giving permission to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.429" end="00:31:16.210" style="s2">try the thing right I like your idea of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.289" end="00:31:18.519" style="s2">like hey we&#39;re gonna take zinc and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.210" end="00:31:19.929" style="s2">vitamin C because that&#39;s what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.519" end="00:31:21.700" style="s2">take we feel like that&#39;s gonna be our</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.929" end="00:31:23.259" style="s2">best option but feeding that system</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.700" end="00:31:26.289" style="s2">money that&#39;s money feeding that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.259" end="00:31:27.940" style="s2">information back into the system so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.289" end="00:31:29.889" style="s2">can have more information on how this</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.940" end="00:31:33.129" style="s2">thing&#39;s rights have more information on</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.889" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">what your best defense is to to not get</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.129" end="00:31:39.999" style="s2">it and if you get it to live through it</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:44.619" style="s2">at all demographics I think it&#39;s a both</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.999" end="00:31:48.429" style="s2">ends it&#39;s what were maybe at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.619" end="00:31:52.379" style="s2">threshold of seeing with game B is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.429" end="00:31:56.739" style="s2">emergence not only of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.379" end="00:31:59.979" style="s2">self-organizing networks in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.739" end="00:32:03.399" style="s2">purchasing side but also in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.979" end="00:32:05.429" style="s2">supply side so right now the field there</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.399" end="00:32:09.909" style="s2">there are lots of barriers that keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.429" end="00:32:14.710" style="s2">people from offering services without</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.909" end="00:32:17.409" style="s2">jumping through outlandish hoops for for</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.710" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">it education is one example I mean Lee</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.409" end="00:32:24.759" style="s2">the cartels that have got credentialing</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:28.239" style="s2">systems solely to protect you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.759" end="00:32:30.779" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re marketed advantage they</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.239" end="00:32:34.450" style="s2">essentially make it next to impossible</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.779" end="00:32:37.769" style="s2">for non credential alternatives to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.450" end="00:32:41.710" style="s2">come up but what if there were to be on</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.769" end="00:32:43.869" style="s2">places and I&#39;m not that optimistic that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.710" end="00:32:47.139" style="s2">the u.s. is going to be anywhere near</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.869" end="00:32:50.650" style="s2">the the front of the packet with this</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.139" end="00:32:52.330" style="s2">but what if some societies</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.650" end="00:32:54.750" style="s2">that have seen them the extent of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.330" end="00:32:59.320" style="s2">breakdown and failure in the established</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.750" end="00:33:02.130" style="s2">top-down systems allow associations of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.320" end="00:33:05.890" style="s2">providers to create their own insurance</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.130" end="00:33:09.130" style="s2">offerings mutual insurance companies do</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:12.940" style="s2">have a history on and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.130" end="00:33:15.280" style="s2">possible I think for groups to form that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.940" end="00:33:19.420" style="s2">say we think we understand this</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.280" end="00:33:24.809" style="s2">particular set of risk risks and rewards</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.420" end="00:33:27.370" style="s2">and we can offer them group policies we</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.809" end="00:33:29.350" style="s2">let&#39;s say the game being Mutual</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.370" end="00:33:33.550" style="s2">Insurance Company one of several</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.350" end="00:33:38.110" style="s2">hopefully on hit upon certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.550" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">good practices that would lower risks</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.110" end="00:33:46.840" style="s2">health risks dramatically and then it</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:52.110" style="s2">could crowd fund org or come up with</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.840" end="00:33:56.200" style="s2">other ways to to the source enough money</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.110" end="00:33:59.800" style="s2">to say we&#39;re willing to take these bets</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.200" end="00:34:02.679" style="s2">if you will document in a verifiable way</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.800" end="00:34:05.890" style="s2">uploading that you&#39;re now doing these</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.679" end="00:34:12.490" style="s2">exercises every week or you know sharing</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.890" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">some of the grocery build receipts then</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.490" end="00:34:19.780" style="s2">those groups that opt-in in these ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:22.590" style="s2">could get a much better deal to from</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.780" end="00:34:26.230" style="s2">from these alternatives the classic</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.590" end="00:34:29.730" style="s2">corporate offerings so I think it works</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.230" end="00:34:33.250" style="s2">both on the supply side the mutual</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.730" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">associations can can in a freer market</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.250" end="00:34:40.750" style="s2">they can they can come in and offer as</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:43.990" style="s2">well as on the consumer side to let</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.750" end="00:34:48.040" style="s2">people buy things in as a group right</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.990" end="00:34:52.419" style="s2">now for example if I&#39;m in a neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.040" end="00:34:55.240" style="s2">that has no condominium association as I</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.419" end="00:34:55.899" style="s2">understand it&#39;s illegal for me and my</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:34:58.930" style="s2">neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.899" end="00:35:02.350" style="s2">to pull together and say we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.930" end="00:35:04.090" style="s2">shop as a group a self-organized group</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.350" end="00:35:06.430" style="s2">to get the best deal</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.090" end="00:35:08.380" style="s2">the life insurance or the best deal for</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.430" end="00:35:12.100" style="s2">liability insurance on what our</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.380" end="00:35:15.700" style="s2">insurance you name it that&#39;s illegal and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.100" end="00:35:18.790" style="s2">it&#39;s because corporations don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.700" end="00:35:21.580" style="s2">lose the the kind of market advantage</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.790" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">they they now have so I would put that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.580" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">high in the list of reform experiments</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.460" end="00:35:31.450" style="s2">within the US and outside the US to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:35.380" style="s2">what happens when when you remove the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.450" end="00:35:36.850" style="s2">barriers in that way interesting to to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.380" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">see if play out I don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.850" end="00:35:41.530" style="s2">faith in insurance I think when it first</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:43.960" style="s2">started it was about mitigating a risk</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.530" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">and it started with a purpose and now</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.960" end="00:35:48.580" style="s2">it&#39;s only in it for profit so unless you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:50.680" style="s2">have truly a member owned insurance</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.580" end="00:35:53.560" style="s2">which isn&#39;t about one person having the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.680" end="00:35:55.060" style="s2">mission and then like they&#39;re figuring</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.560" end="00:35:56.500" style="s2">out the math and they&#39;re figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.060" end="00:35:58.450" style="s2">math to make a profit so they&#39;re looking</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.050" end="00:36:06.390" style="s2">life insurance and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.940" end="00:36:08.950" style="s2">whereas in Canada where we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.390" end="00:36:10.180" style="s2">universal health care I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.950" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">worry about that I kind of its</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.180" end="00:36:13.660" style="s2">overarching so it&#39;s like what do we want</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:15.640" style="s2">people to stay alive we can&#39;t afford a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.660" end="00:36:18.340" style="s2">million dollars per year for somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.640" end="00:36:20.500" style="s2">medication and we don&#39;t fund things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.340" end="00:36:21.790" style="s2">are brand-new unfortunately but but</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.500" end="00:36:22.990" style="s2">anyway I don&#39;t want to stir this baby</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.790" end="00:36:24.910" style="s2">stay on that because I think that there</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.990" end="00:36:27.670" style="s2">is potential there and potential that to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.910" end="00:36:28.990" style="s2">play to free games and find find what</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.670" end="00:36:31.330" style="s2">does work within that I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.990" end="00:36:35.410" style="s2">if you could start a insurance company</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.330" end="00:36:37.540" style="s2">with 10,000 people and $100,000 but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.410" end="00:36:39.430" style="s2">could do a Neighborhood Association you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.540" end="00:36:43.780" style="s2">could do hey how do you in fact there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.430" end="00:36:45.370" style="s2">a an app that I downloaded I can get an</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.780" end="00:36:46.900" style="s2">email alerts from my local neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.370" end="00:36:49.450" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to find it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.900" end="00:36:51.460" style="s2">Facebook for your neighborhood and so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.450" end="00:36:53.530" style="s2">get the odd like hey we lost this shoe a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.460" end="00:36:55.120" style="s2">her walk or we have a dog that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.530" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">here to be able to have people sign up</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.120" end="00:36:59.580" style="s2">during this crisis so that not only are</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:02.380" style="s2">they there right now but they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.580" end="00:37:04.570" style="s2">after I hate that like now we have these</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.380" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">connected neighborhoods now that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.570" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">have my one that I Drive to how do I</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:10.120" style="s2">connect with my actual local neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:11.340" style="s2">including in a time when we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.120" end="00:37:13.830" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.340" end="00:37:16.530" style="s2">less capable of actually being there for</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.830" end="00:37:18.180" style="s2">one another in a like I can&#39;t offer</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.530" end="00:37:20.460" style="s2">childcare for somebody else who has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.180" end="00:37:22.500" style="s2">do it work because we&#39;re solve isolating</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.460" end="00:37:24.030" style="s2">you know our like if our school closed</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.500" end="00:37:26.010" style="s2">down due to a strike I could absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.030" end="00:37:28.080" style="s2">offer child care to somebody else but</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.010" end="00:37:31.490" style="s2">having those systems in place having the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.080" end="00:37:36.030" style="s2">ability to coordinate with neighbors and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.490" end="00:37:37.530" style="s2">I envision something about like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.030" end="00:37:38.910" style="s2">Dragons Den or Shark Tank because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.530" end="00:37:41.580" style="s2">think what&#39;s called an in the States</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.910" end="00:37:43.260" style="s2">where instead of having billionaires who</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.580" end="00:37:45.510" style="s2">are seeing it well they invest in it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.260" end="00:37:48.990" style="s2">as is financially viable having</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.510" end="00:37:53.550" style="s2">scientists and engineers sedating how</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.990" end="00:37:55.590" style="s2">good is this thing this solution and how</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.550" end="00:37:57.630" style="s2">viable is it is it better than the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.590" end="00:37:58.650" style="s2">nothing what else are what else is out</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.630" end="00:38:00.780" style="s2">there right it&#39;s comparing it to what</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.650" end="00:38:03.900" style="s2">they know is out there and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.780" end="00:38:07.170" style="s2">could be something that could be started</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.900" end="00:38:08.730" style="s2">with 10,000 viewers and you know anyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.170" end="00:38:11.130" style="s2">who has a solution could come on and be</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.730" end="00:38:12.270" style="s2">like hey yes look at my solution is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.130" end="00:38:13.530" style="s2">the best maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.270" end="00:38:15.900" style="s2">but like it&#39;s something and right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.530" end="00:38:18.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a way to test the krona virus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.900" end="00:38:20.040" style="s2">a way to help people self Eisley it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.300" end="00:38:21.180" style="s2">like whatever the solution is right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.040" end="00:38:23.400" style="s2">not thinking of this just for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.180" end="00:38:27.000" style="s2">infectious disease but it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.400" end="00:38:28.830" style="s2">that could benefit when you have tens of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.000" end="00:38:30.750" style="s2">millions of people watching it which you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.830" end="00:38:33.660" style="s2">start with ten thousand and grow then</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.750" end="00:38:35.460" style="s2">you can do things like realize how</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.660" end="00:38:38.730" style="s2">ridiculous it is that it we need two</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.460" end="00:38:40.830" style="s2">years of testing on something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.730" end="00:38:42.900" style="s2">gonna save lives now right that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.830" end="00:38:44.610" style="s2">especially when quite frankly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.900" end="00:38:46.410" style="s2">not doing that test you don&#39;t actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.610" end="00:38:49.020" style="s2">things in the marketplace that bypass</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.410" end="00:38:50.310" style="s2">about all the time when it&#39;s for heart</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.020" end="00:38:52.530" style="s2">disease and all these other things</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.310" end="00:38:54.120" style="s2">because they have lobbyists but now that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.530" end="00:38:55.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like people&#39;s lives on the line now</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.120" end="00:38:58.650" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna make sure we go through two</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.470" end="00:39:01.830" style="s2">years of rigorous testing that seems a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.650" end="00:39:03.780" style="s2">little ridiculous can we get the best of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.830" end="00:39:05.580" style="s2">can we get the least risk possible and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.780" end="00:39:09.270" style="s2">do people understand this is risky and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.580" end="00:39:11.580" style="s2">are you willing to take it question the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.270" end="00:39:14.940" style="s2">question I have on with this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.580" end="00:39:18.420" style="s2">kind of an open you know here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.940" end="00:39:22.290" style="s2">idea here&#39;s that idea that on unless</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.420" end="00:39:23.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a way for it to for there to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.290" end="00:39:27.980" style="s2">grouped</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.360" end="00:39:30.890" style="s2">um that has a sample size on it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.980" end="00:39:33.080" style="s2">hard to know if it&#39;s let&#39;s say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.890" end="00:39:36.650" style="s2">subgroup that that&#39;s really sold on</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.080" end="00:39:41.600" style="s2">melatonin as a way to minimize risk</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.650" end="00:39:45.170" style="s2">another subgroup that&#39;s on a combination</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.600" end="00:39:50.110" style="s2">of things that unless you&#39;ve got large</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.170" end="00:39:53.960" style="s2">enough samples and reliable data that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.110" end="00:39:58.310" style="s2">privacy protected encrypted but also</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.960" end="00:40:03.470" style="s2">verifiable that it the system as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.310" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">can&#39;t learn so I favor on as an adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.470" end="00:40:10.520" style="s2">possible something that allowed on</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:17.090" style="s2">cohorts two to form around whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.520" end="00:40:21.170" style="s2">is and that we hopefully don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.090" end="00:40:25.400" style="s2">little episodic from tiny you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.170" end="00:40:27.770" style="s2">things clogging up the the public square</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.400" end="00:40:31.370" style="s2">and that in that kind of environment but</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.770" end="00:40:34.250" style="s2">rather have competition among systemic</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.370" end="00:40:36.380" style="s2">approaches that have opted in and buy</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.250" end="00:40:39.950" style="s2">and buy large enough groups either</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.380" end="00:40:44.870" style="s2">virtual cohorts or actual places that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.950" end="00:40:48.500" style="s2">opt in to to whatever their choices of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.870" end="00:40:51.170" style="s2">systemic approach I think that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.500" end="00:40:54.440" style="s2">learn faster what combinations and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.170" end="00:40:56.840" style="s2">things have most results if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.440" end="00:40:59.030" style="s2">possible I absolutely agree what I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.840" end="00:41:01.220" style="s2">in picturing for the Sharks tank dragons</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.030" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">den thing was more like oh we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.220" end="00:41:05.240" style="s2">enough respirators hey I&#39;ve invented a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:06.260" style="s2">new respirator is is fun yes it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.240" end="00:41:08.030" style="s2">better than the ones that are on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.260" end="00:41:11.900" style="s2">market but is it better than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.030" end="00:41:13.640" style="s2">right like more a invention or a system</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.900" end="00:41:14.780" style="s2">for people to look at and critique</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.640" end="00:41:16.490" style="s2">because yeah you&#39;re not gonna know</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.780" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">vitamin C&#39;s the answer well unless we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.490" end="00:41:20.690" style="s2">test it we really don&#39;t know so who is</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:22.130" style="s2">willing to take vitamin C I&#39;m healthy</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.690" end="00:41:24.080" style="s2">enough I&#39;ll take it compare me to other</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.130" end="00:41:26.300" style="s2">people I&#39;ll give you my data right so</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.080" end="00:41:27.950" style="s2">yeah and hobby and that would be one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.300" end="00:41:30.590" style="s2">the things you could put your Megan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.950" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">den right be like hey we want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.590" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">to form these groups and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:35.990" style="s2">report how do we make it safe enough why</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:37.550" style="s2">we make it this way</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.990" end="00:41:40.010" style="s2">having a process to be able to solve</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.550" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">solutions this is mine doing solution</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.010" end="00:41:42.700" style="s2">raising and then how do we create the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:45.230" style="s2">technology to do this on a grand scale</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.700" end="00:41:47.020" style="s2">but right now when we&#39;re needing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.230" end="00:41:49.100" style="s2">how do we get the best ideas out there</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.020" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">without having them have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.100" end="00:41:52.070" style="s2">the marketplace where they have to find</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:53.840" style="s2">their own funding they have to find</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.070" end="00:41:55.850" style="s2">their own marketing they have to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.840" end="00:41:58.940" style="s2">know build their own trust instead of</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.850" end="00:42:00.860" style="s2">like is the respirator good I want my</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.940" end="00:42:03.320" style="s2">dad to stay alive you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.860" end="00:42:05.390" style="s2">like so I want that respirator if the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.320" end="00:42:10.070" style="s2">other option is sorry everybody over 60</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.390" end="00:42:11.450" style="s2">gets to die now right like having and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.070" end="00:42:13.160" style="s2">just giving each other permission maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.450" end="00:42:15.260" style="s2">with the Jubilee which would not be done</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.160" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">at 10,000 but like hey we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.260" end="00:42:20.810" style="s2">these things and illegal or not come</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:24.470" style="s2">after all of us then right like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.810" end="00:42:28.330" style="s2">gonna try these things Eric have you</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.470" end="00:42:32.210" style="s2">found online any groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.330" end="00:42:35.510" style="s2">Wellsprings of innovation that you think</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.210" end="00:42:36.980" style="s2">would be an adjacent possible to well</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.510" end="00:42:38.660" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.980" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">that&#39;s me well I&#39;ve been listening to</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.660" end="00:42:45.410" style="s2">you guys talk the first is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:46.910" style="s2">cohorts trying out zinc or vitamin C or</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.410" end="00:42:50.090" style="s2">whatever it might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.910" end="00:42:52.580" style="s2">in principle I absolutely agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.090" end="00:42:54.140" style="s2">the problem is and unless these things</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.580" end="00:42:55.850" style="s2">are very carefully controlled that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.140" end="00:42:57.530" style="s2">within that kögel okay everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.850" end="00:43:00.290" style="s2">taking zinc but you don&#39;t know what else</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.530" end="00:43:03.770" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that maybe you know Co</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.290" end="00:43:06.290" style="s2">impacting or nullifying or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.770" end="00:43:08.570" style="s2">they&#39;re very very very careful control</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.290" end="00:43:10.490" style="s2">and analysis needs to be done well the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.570" end="00:43:12.109" style="s2">other thing that occurred to me now and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.490" end="00:43:13.730" style="s2">this isn&#39;t really a jacent possible this</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.109" end="00:43:15.890" style="s2">is a little bit further down the road I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.730" end="00:43:17.780" style="s2">guess but what you were talking i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.890" end="00:43:21.410" style="s2">it was you mark talking earlier on about</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.780" end="00:43:25.160" style="s2">this you know anonymized information</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.410" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">gathering thing that if everybody I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.160" end="00:43:29.240" style="s2">just imagining everybody hooked up to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:31.250" style="s2">that and and it&#39;s recording everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.240" end="00:43:32.780" style="s2">that you do right every glass of water</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.250" end="00:43:35.000" style="s2">that you drink every run that you take</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.780" end="00:43:37.520" style="s2">every shit that you have you know and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.000" end="00:43:43.630" style="s2">what time and how solid it is and all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.520" end="00:43:48.290" style="s2">this kind of thing right then the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.630" end="00:43:49.819" style="s2">combination of choices dietary lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.290" end="00:43:53.630" style="s2">whatever sleeping habits</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.819" end="00:43:56.359" style="s2">that best immunize you from a particular</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.630" end="00:43:58.430" style="s2">disease or whatever again whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.359" end="00:43:59.930" style="s2">might be these things would emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.430" end="00:44:02.119" style="s2">the day so right</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.930" end="00:44:03.619" style="s2">or at least correlate or relationships</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.119" end="00:44:05.390" style="s2">would emerge from the date they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.619" end="00:44:06.440" style="s2">necessarily be causal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.390" end="00:44:08.989" style="s2">right there would have to be examined</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.440" end="00:44:10.549" style="s2">but correlate early relationships would</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.989" end="00:44:14.299" style="s2">pop up all the time and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.549" end="00:44:15.799" style="s2">excellent fodder for examination so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.299" end="00:44:17.779" style="s2">Jubilees objection which I absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.799" end="00:44:19.369" style="s2">share notwithstanding that you know you</p>

<p begin="00:45:18.849" end="00:45:24.019" style="s2">effervescent with ideas for these</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.069" end="00:45:27.229" style="s2">possible things that could be done one</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.019" end="00:45:30.109" style="s2">of which was a toilet seat that wouldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.069" end="00:45:42.499" style="s2">that the plumes that come which are</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:47.599" style="s2">laden with with virus and infected</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.499" end="00:45:51.079" style="s2">households these plumes are our twelve</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.079" end="00:45:56.299" style="s2">with with the seat up so to your point I</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.749" end="00:45:59.239" style="s2">think it would be possible potentially</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.299" end="00:46:03.530" style="s2">in this community of innovation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.239" end="00:46:06.050" style="s2">and and people are very motivated to</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.530" end="00:46:10.360" style="s2">find things that work that if they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.050" end="00:46:13.840" style="s2">to opt in to a system that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.360" end="00:46:17.390" style="s2">essentially a data vault not captured by</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.840" end="00:46:21.260" style="s2">by a corporation or government but a</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.390" end="00:46:24.770" style="s2">peer-to-peer system where the contract</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.260" end="00:46:27.950" style="s2">through through smart sensors these kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.770" end="00:46:31.970" style="s2">of habits and behaviors it might be that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.950" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">among the zinc popping cohort there</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.970" end="00:46:36.080" style="s2">might if there were tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:38.810" style="s2">them some of which were using</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.080" end="00:46:43.100" style="s2">innovations like the humidity sensors</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.810" end="00:46:44.840" style="s2">and the way for her neighbors and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.100" end="00:46:48.020" style="s2">friends to make sure that those were</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.840" end="00:46:51.260" style="s2">seeing in a good range and another</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.260" end="00:46:56.750" style="s2">you know scenario it would be possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.600" end="00:47:01.070" style="s2">with large enough groups to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.750" end="00:47:05.650" style="s2">correlations emerge not just from one or</p>

<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:17.900" style="s2">the benefit for people coming in I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.410" end="00:47:20.690" style="s2">it the way it could be structured would</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.900" end="00:47:25.220" style="s2">be to say all who participate in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.690" end="00:47:27.770" style="s2">are going to have access within X number</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.410" end="00:47:58.310" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s such a focus now on</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.320" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">the part of people worldwide in such big</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.310" end="00:48:04.760" style="s2">stakes that it potentially could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:08.600" style="s2">something that would catch on with a few</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.760" end="00:48:10.610" style="s2">pilot projects of could scale yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.600" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">have a little bit of an issue of link of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.610" end="00:48:16.130" style="s2">linking the information to the products</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:17.150" style="s2">that are gonna that seems like very very</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.150" end="00:48:21.410" style="s2">closely akin to advertising writer</p>

<p begin="00:48:21.410" end="00:48:29.749" style="s2">that it is almost that right we want the</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.749" end="00:48:35.029" style="s2">the data versus the person who&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.579" end="00:48:36.799" style="s2">that be like this is the best one that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.029" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">you know taking zinc and living with a</p>

<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.950" style="s2">blah blah but then it&#39;s on you to go and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:44.900" style="s2">find where you know your zinc and your</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.690" end="00:49:00.799" style="s2">and I think part of the problem is this</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.819" end="00:49:04.999" style="s2">is such a complex field for people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.799" end="00:49:06.950" style="s2">aren&#39;t up to speed in it that they can</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.999" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">get lost so the the more that their</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.950" end="00:49:12.259" style="s2">trust networks can help shortlist</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:14.749" style="s2">options not say this is the place or</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:45.140" style="s2">is yes it&#39;s it&#39;s a hop skip and not even</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.710" end="00:49:54.680" style="s2">enough there is an another piece of data</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.460" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">that I would love to incorporate in it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.289" end="00:50:28.670" style="s2">like most of what health is is nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.630" end="00:50:29.869" style="s2">and nurture right you can&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.670" end="00:50:30.410" style="s2">anything about the nature but it gives</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.410" end="00:50:35.990" style="s2">really important information whereas the</p>

<p begin="00:50:43.460" end="00:50:48.440" style="s2">and so having the genome there to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.040" end="00:50:50.330" style="s2">hey these people have this in common and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.440" end="00:50:52.010" style="s2">just more information and we have among</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.330" end="00:50:54.200" style="s2">a lot of people have access to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.010" end="00:50:54.860" style="s2">information but it&#39;s not able to be put</p>

<p begin="00:50:54.860" end="00:50:59.810" style="s2">same with fitbit&#39;s and all this smart</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:02.120" style="s2">data that they if we can figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.810" end="00:51:03.470" style="s2">I should own my Fitbit data yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.120" end="00:51:05.180" style="s2">should be able to decide what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.470" end="00:51:07.670" style="s2">it and then when a systems design that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.180" end="00:51:09.290" style="s2">trust that I can upload that into I can</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.670" end="00:51:11.750" style="s2">upload my genetic information because</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.290" end="00:51:13.310" style="s2">it&#39;s mine and that being said there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.480" end="00:51:24.020" style="s2">secrets and truths that can come out and</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:25.670" style="s2">in that information and information we</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.020" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">might find out it&#39;s global society that</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.670" end="00:51:34.970" style="s2">we did we didn&#39;t know as well but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">genomes genomes and our environment data</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.970" end="00:51:43.540" style="s2">then own the data that is really pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:43.540" style="s2">sure at the point right now legally Wow</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.630" end="00:51:48.230" style="s2">and then that like if we passed laws</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.610" end="00:51:49.310" style="s2">then like you can upload yours and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.230" end="00:51:51.650" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter if you have a Fitbit</p>

<p begin="00:51:58.040" end="00:52:01.970" style="s2">because I can&#39;t solve my health issues</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.900" end="00:52:04.580" style="s2">by myself I can only solve them with</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.970" end="00:52:06.310" style="s2">cohorts right I can only even if I try</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.580" end="00:52:09.440" style="s2">something and it makes me feel better</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.310" end="00:52:12.290" style="s2">how long is that gonna last for and is</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.440" end="00:52:14.270" style="s2">it placebo is it naseeb oh is it to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.290" end="00:52:16.250" style="s2">able to say hey is this my genetics is</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.270" end="00:52:17.780" style="s2">this is it gonna be changed by diet you</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.250" end="00:52:22.790" style="s2">need to have more information and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.780" end="00:52:26.020" style="s2">involves a population random sorry are</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.790" end="00:52:29.210" style="s2">you are you part of patients like me</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.020" end="00:52:32.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a peer network where people who</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.210" end="00:52:37.030" style="s2">have a common health challenge</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.020" end="00:52:41.810" style="s2">essentially compare notes online and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.030" end="00:52:43.850" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s quite a big network now is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.810" end="00:52:47.690" style="s2">that do you see any prospect</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.850" end="00:52:51.950" style="s2">that could be a place where people</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.690" end="00:52:55.010" style="s2">willing to to have DNA sharing could</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.950" end="00:52:59.560" style="s2">could do that and in ways that would</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.010" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">approach the sort of level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.560" end="00:53:05.480" style="s2">significance and sample size yeah that&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:07.490" style="s2">be interesting I&#39;ve never heard of</p>

<p begin="00:56:44.150" end="00:56:48.380" style="s2">something you can do and then when stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.370" end="00:56:49.220" style="s2">goes perfectly wrong with our data how</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.380" end="00:56:54.560" style="s2">do we fix that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.220" end="00:56:57.590" style="s2">the next solutions and and for people in</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.560" end="00:57:06.790" style="s2">my age group at least thinking of what</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.790" end="00:57:10.990" style="s2">neuron to participate in projects like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.220" end="00:57:15.880" style="s2">this that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.990" end="00:57:20.680" style="s2">rated value for one&#39;s progeny and their</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.880" end="00:57:22.900" style="s2">kids so I think the notion of having in</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.680" end="00:57:29.290" style="s2">a peer-to-peer system a way for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.900" end="00:57:32.710" style="s2">early movers to know that the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.290" end="00:57:37.270" style="s2">insights from this are going to be made</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.710" end="00:57:40.270" style="s2">available on a first serve basis to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.270" end="00:57:42.010" style="s2">families extends families of of those</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.270" end="00:57:46.630" style="s2">who participate I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.010" end="00:57:48.970" style="s2">quite a a welcomed prospect on a</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.630" end="00:57:52.800" style="s2">personal note I you know was diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.970" end="00:57:55.210" style="s2">10 years ago with prostate cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.800" end="00:57:57.970" style="s2">the treatment the preferred treatment</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.210" end="00:58:01.810" style="s2">after I researched pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.970" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">carefully was something the FDA had not</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.810" end="00:58:06.310" style="s2">approved and the reason it hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:11.160" style="s2">approved was a medical device and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.310" end="00:58:15.880" style="s2">ultrasound devices the manufacturer kept</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.160" end="00:58:19.410" style="s2">improving it and so since each device</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.880" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">would have to go through a an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.410" end="00:58:26.590" style="s2">ly expensive testing multi-year testing</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:29.560" style="s2">and then be obsolete they focused on</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.590" end="00:58:32.830" style="s2">urine which had a far more open</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.560" end="00:58:37.230" style="s2">regulatory system and our parts of the</p>

<p begin="00:58:44.020" end="00:58:50.590" style="s2">treatment that&#39;s absolutely commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.170" end="00:58:54.010" style="s2">and proven in all over the world in</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.590" end="00:58:56.650" style="s2">Japan China and Europe and the FDA</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.010" end="00:59:00.390" style="s2">because of the rapid pace of change just</p>

<p begin="00:59:00.390" end="00:59:09.369" style="s2">we we&#39;ve got to be more flexible and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.130" end="00:59:12.609" style="s2">they did on but now we&#39;re at a torrent</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.369" end="00:59:15.609" style="s2">we have exponential change in you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.609" end="00:59:20.200" style="s2">sensor systems and medical devices and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.609" end="00:59:25.319" style="s2">if if we&#39;re road blocking</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.200" end="00:59:28.569" style="s2">these pooled crowd-sourced innovations</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.319" end="00:59:30.520" style="s2">prototype devices and essentially saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.569" end="00:59:32.740" style="s2">nope you&#39;ve got a you&#39;ve got to jump</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.520" end="00:59:36.119" style="s2">through the hurdles that will cost</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.740" end="00:59:40.030" style="s2">millions and probably lead to an</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.119" end="00:59:48.490" style="s2">obsolete out-of-date device by the time</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.030" end="00:59:50.079" style="s2">it does see see daylight I would love</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.490" end="00:59:54.220" style="s2">more and more to see</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.079" end="00:59:59.319" style="s2">experimental jurisdictions on areas with</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.220" end="01:00:02.500" style="s2">different regulatory regimes that all of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.319" end="01:00:06.630" style="s2">us can learn from with with the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.500" end="01:00:09.579" style="s2">data that is not going to be distorted</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.630" end="01:00:12.579" style="s2">you know by by vested interests and</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.579" end="01:00:15.000" style="s2">bureaucracies and corporations I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.579" end="01:00:17.530" style="s2">that that could be an enormous growth</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.000" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">possibility and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.530" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">biggest I&#39;ve sat with this one because</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:23.290" style="s2">of my health issues for a lot of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:25.900" style="s2">how could we use technology to help us</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.290" end="01:00:27.490" style="s2">improve our health and this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.900" end="01:00:29.230" style="s2">people would need to be forced to do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.490" end="01:00:30.849" style="s2">right we have to put our information and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.230" end="01:00:32.650" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely not the road I want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.849" end="01:00:34.059" style="s2">go down and so if you have a voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.650" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">system I like the idea because first of</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.059" end="01:00:37.630" style="s2">all your progeny are gonna be the number</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:38.650" style="s2">one people to benefit because they share</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.630" end="01:00:39.910" style="s2">your genetics if they share your</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.650" end="01:00:42.790" style="s2">genetics or I don&#39;t think we call</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.910" end="01:00:46.119" style="s2">progeny anything different but if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.790" end="01:00:48.010" style="s2">choose not to share your data the person</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.119" end="01:00:49.210" style="s2">you&#39;re hurting the most the demographics</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.010" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">you were hurting the most or any</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.210" end="01:00:55.660" style="s2">demographics you&#39;re part of so if all</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:56.859" style="s2">you know white men with diabetes somehow</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.660" end="01:00:58.390" style="s2">there was something correlated where</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.859" end="01:01:00.130" style="s2">they didn&#39;t trust and they didn&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.390" end="01:01:01.210" style="s2">their data it would be white men without</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.130" end="01:01:04.180" style="s2">diabetes we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.210" end="01:01:06.490" style="s2">information the system on right so more</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.180" end="01:01:09.790" style="s2">information is gonna benefit every group</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.490" end="01:01:11.530" style="s2">you&#39;re part of and yeah there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.790" end="01:01:13.299" style="s2">power in our data and that&#39;s why I want</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.530" end="01:01:16.510" style="s2">a cooperatively owned technology company</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.299" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">so we can trust in sharing our data in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.510" end="01:01:21.160" style="s2">way that can benefit me and all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:23.410" style="s2">humanity with it where everyone feels</p>

<p begin="01:01:39.150" end="01:01:42.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we came up with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.710" end="01:01:44.549" style="s2">definitive answers we&#39;d usually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.630" end="01:01:46.799" style="s2">but lots of sparks of ideas of things</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.549" end="01:01:49.140" style="s2">that are have huge potential to help</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.799" end="01:01:51.450" style="s2">create solutions on this planet during</p>
