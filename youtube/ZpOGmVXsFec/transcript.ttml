<p begin="00:00:01.319" end="00:00:08.940" style="s2">well this is exciting this is a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.950" end="00:00:11.460" style="s2">venue and it is my sincere hope and aim</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.940" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">that every two weeks we can gather here</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.460" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">and have meaningful conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">important matters</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:21.899" style="s2">of our time those important matters of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:23.669" style="s2">course in a very abstract way are</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.899" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">defined by what&#39;s important to us as</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.669" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">individuals but also what&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:29.759" style="s2">us as a collective and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">navigating the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.759" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">individual and collective in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:38.190" style="s2">meaningful way while making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:41.490" style="s2">what&#39;s going on that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.190" end="00:00:44.310" style="s2">ticket towards at least a decent stab at</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.490" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">continuity into the future for the human</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.310" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">race now it&#39;s quite a broad thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:51.390" style="s2">just to chuck that one in at the end</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:53.180" style="s2">there but that is how it sort of seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.390" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.180" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">extinction rebellions happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">moment in the UK it&#39;s going on fairly</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">big and there&#39;s been stuff happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:06.110" style="s2">here in Melbourne and that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:09.590" style="s2">necessary piece of the awareness puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.110" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">but as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.590" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">climate activism and climate change is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">type of behavior or attitude towards a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">particular crisis we&#39;re facing and there</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">are many crises we&#39;re facing and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:34.979" style="s2">seems to me like the sense-making crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:37.440" style="s2">and the meaning crisis are really core</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">to being able to make effective</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.440" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">decisions about anything else if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:43.260" style="s2">can&#39;t really make sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">happening in the world becomes difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.260" end="00:01:49.080" style="s2">to know what actions we should take in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">it you know we&#39;re complex processes</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.080" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">ourselves and we&#39;re embedded in many</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">many complex processes in nature and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">culture so it is my hope and aim for</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:11.290" style="s2">that a very simple and beautiful way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">begin presencing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.290" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">and developing in relationship to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:24.209" style="s2">territory can be at least heartily begun</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:28.650" style="s2">by gathering together in community to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.209" end="00:02:34.299" style="s2">listen and speak with authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.650" end="00:02:37.780" style="s2">regarding what comes up and well where</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.299" end="00:02:43.000" style="s2">we go from there is is something</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.780" end="00:02:43.389" style="s2">entirely up for discussion so all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.000" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.389" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">now this evening it&#39;s the first event in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:56.079" style="s2">this venue here and joining me is my</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">good friend cam Duffy now cam I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.079" end="00:03:01.750" style="s2">going to introduce you no I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:04.930" style="s2">will introduce cam that was an error cam</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.750" end="00:03:07.750" style="s2">works as a dual diagnosis counselor of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.930" end="00:03:08.709" style="s2">individuals and their families you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.750" end="00:03:14.139" style="s2">hear me later in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.709" end="00:03:16.419" style="s2">referred to that as a vocation and does</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.139" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">seem to me at least that there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.419" end="00:03:22.930" style="s2">element of how cam shows up in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:27.190" style="s2">which signifies to me that a calling of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.930" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">his is precisely to enable people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.190" end="00:03:35.229" style="s2">realize their potential in a therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:39.129" style="s2">setting is not not not limiting his</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.229" end="00:03:42.040" style="s2">showing up to that to that descriptor</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.129" end="00:03:45.609" style="s2">but that&#39;s something I happen to respect</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.040" end="00:03:48.940" style="s2">a lot and it&#39;s something I value highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.609" end="00:03:50.680" style="s2">for he has an interest in human</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.940" end="00:03:54.430" style="s2">development the art of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.680" end="00:03:55.930" style="s2">integration therapeutic growth he also</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.430" end="00:03:57.909" style="s2">has a passion for the philosophy and</p>

<p begin="00:03:57.909" end="00:04:02.470" style="s2">optimization and peak experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.669" end="00:04:06.639" style="s2">enable realization of our creative</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.470" end="00:04:10.180" style="s2">potential I found a very special very</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.639" end="00:04:16.850" style="s2">special capacity to engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.180" end="00:04:20.150" style="s2">constructive and beautiful dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.850" end="00:04:29.540" style="s2">with you and I&#39;m really interested to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.150" end="00:04:32.630" style="s2">share that okay so I guess maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">all hear me okay anyway but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.630" end="00:04:39.260" style="s2">going to start talking into that just so</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.030" end="00:04:43.430" style="s2">perhaps for the recording maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.260" end="00:04:45.350" style="s2">sounds roughly the same so I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.430" end="00:04:48.950" style="s2">before we really get going does anybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.350" end="00:04:51.140" style="s2">have any questions does anybody have</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.950" end="00:04:53.630" style="s2">anything to say is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.140" end="00:04:55.400" style="s2">anything that&#39;s mysterious that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.630" end="00:04:58.280" style="s2">tip of your tongue that you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.400" end="00:05:05.270" style="s2">voicing and if not it&#39;s totally okay the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.280" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">silence is good all right I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.270" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">perhaps what you might do is just take</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">30 seconds in silence together and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">cam and I will begin a dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">we&#39;ll see where we get to so okay just</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:24.020" style="s2">take a few a few seconds to drop into</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:40.700" style="s2">yourself perhaps shut your eyes</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.659" end="00:06:04.559" style="s2">many different things all at once feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.219" end="00:06:07.889" style="s2">what it is to be a flux of many</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.559" end="00:06:12.360" style="s2">different feelings and then at the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.889" end="00:06:14.939" style="s2">time I sought a voice that&#39;s looking to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.360" end="00:06:32.809" style="s2">bring some sort of coherence to all of</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.379" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">connection in the age of connection and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.449" end="00:07:02.610" style="s2">they seem to me to be two really</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:06.649" style="s2">fundamental concepts and importantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.610" end="00:07:10.649" style="s2">they are concepts that can be felt</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.649" end="00:07:13.939" style="s2">there&#39;s a real sense in which this</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.649" end="00:07:17.999" style="s2">connection connection continuity</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.939" end="00:07:22.709" style="s2">discontinuity who you are who you will</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.999" end="00:07:25.800" style="s2">become all of these things are related</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.709" end="00:07:33.540" style="s2">somehow they&#39;re related in this flow of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.800" end="00:07:35.030" style="s2">life and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.540" end="00:07:37.590" style="s2">relationship we don&#39;t talk about much</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.030" end="00:07:40.110" style="s2">but it is know where we know it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.590" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2">that we&#39;re on the pulse of it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.110" end="00:07:48.590" style="s2">seeking seeking connection about</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:51.590" style="s2">constantly finding ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.590" end="00:07:51.590" style="s2">disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.130" end="00:08:00.270" style="s2">and then we find ourselves connected</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.870" end="00:08:04.740" style="s2">again so perhaps just as a opening for</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.270" end="00:08:08.300" style="s2">this discussion cam what interested you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.740" end="00:08:08.300" style="s2">to be here this evening</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.770" end="00:08:15.510" style="s2">okay says you&#39;ve just mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:17.610" style="s2">idea of connection and disconnection is</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.510" end="00:08:18.840" style="s2">such a primary part of who we are is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.610" end="00:08:22.020" style="s2">that journey as we go on our journey</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.840" end="00:08:24.990" style="s2">through our life and we make meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.020" end="00:08:26.970" style="s2">through what we experience as a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.990" end="00:08:29.070" style="s2">of connection often mmm you know and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.970" end="00:08:32.310" style="s2">strive so much in our lives to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.070" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">challenges towards achieving a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.310" end="00:08:35.910" style="s2">connection and whatever way we attempt</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:37.830" style="s2">to do so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.910" end="00:08:39.419" style="s2">so it&#39;s inherently meaningful for every</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.830" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">one of us I think and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.419" end="00:08:44.340" style="s2">personal thing the idea of connection</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:45.990" style="s2">and things that may be attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.340" end="00:08:49.710" style="s2">towards the tendency towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.990" end="00:08:51.450" style="s2">disconnection so we&#39;re all humans and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.710" end="00:08:55.140" style="s2">this is a very human experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.450" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">connection and relative disconnection as</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.140" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">we go through the various challenges or</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:05.730" style="s2">hardships that we might be challenged</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:07.500" style="s2">with in our lives right there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.730" end="00:09:09.240" style="s2">things that come up for me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.500" end="00:09:10.770" style="s2">in thinking about connection and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.240" end="00:09:13.020" style="s2">disconnection there are they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.770" end="00:09:17.030" style="s2">very broad things one is fear and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.020" end="00:09:22.010" style="s2">other is love it&#39;s difficult to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.030" end="00:09:22.010" style="s2">feeling love in a mode of disconnection</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.210" end="00:09:29.280" style="s2">fear in the mode of connection will</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.210" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s a little bit perhaps that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.280" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">is something we can get out</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.860" end="00:09:46.990" style="s2">we feel losing connection hmm you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.960" end="00:09:49.810" style="s2">was interesting we met together for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.990" end="00:09:51.420" style="s2">last voice Club event to have an inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.810" end="00:09:54.370" style="s2">into what does it mean to be fearless</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.420" end="00:09:57.400" style="s2">and I think a lot of meaningful things</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.370" end="00:09:58.750" style="s2">came up that evening connection and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.400" end="00:10:00.250" style="s2">disconnection was something that came up</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.750" end="00:10:05.830" style="s2">there was a sense in which the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.250" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2">experience of fear was one of being</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.830" end="00:10:12.970" style="s2">somehow disconnected from yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:17.230" style="s2">the title for that event was actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.970" end="00:10:18.790" style="s2">something that cam came up with and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.230" end="00:10:21.550" style="s2">was excited to do it because it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.790" end="00:10:24.070" style="s2">something camp came up with so I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.550" end="00:10:26.730" style="s2">cam what comes up with you with respect</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.070" end="00:10:30.790" style="s2">to fear here and how it relates to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.730" end="00:10:36.580" style="s2">it means to be connected to yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.790" end="00:10:38.350" style="s2">or disconnected from yourself the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.580" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">perspective that comes to mind for me is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.350" end="00:10:43.800" style="s2">one of human development and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:46.270" style="s2">tendency of our nervous systems to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.800" end="00:10:48.930" style="s2">advice towards achieving a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.270" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">certainty so the neural pathways</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.930" end="00:10:55.860" style="s2">associated with survival those which</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:59.470" style="s2">reinforced or prioritized in our systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.860" end="00:11:02.250" style="s2">but with that comes sometimes it can get</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.470" end="00:11:05.470" style="s2">locked in for instance with trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.250" end="00:11:07.180" style="s2">that can lead to disconnection from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.470" end="00:11:08.920" style="s2">body sometimes in heightened states of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.180" end="00:11:11.950" style="s2">trauma you can just totally dissociate</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.920" end="00:11:14.860" style="s2">and there is this tendency to disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.950" end="00:11:16.870" style="s2">when the body is overwhelmed and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.860" end="00:11:19.270" style="s2">there needs to be a healing process that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.870" end="00:11:22.120" style="s2">you go through within yourself in order</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.270" end="00:11:25.300" style="s2">to re-establish connection amongst</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.120" end="00:11:27.340" style="s2">different levels of developments from</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.300" end="00:11:30.370" style="s2">the brainstem up towards the limbic</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.340" end="00:11:32.650" style="s2">system and the frontal lobes the cortex</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.370" end="00:11:34.270" style="s2">these systems need to be fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.650" end="00:11:36.520" style="s2">integrated in order to have an internal</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.270" end="00:11:38.230" style="s2">sense of connection which then relates</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.520" end="00:11:40.630" style="s2">to your ability to connect with those</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.230" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">outside of yourself as you progress</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.630" end="00:11:45.130" style="s2">through that journey and that requires</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:48.730" style="s2">the overcoming of fear because these</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.130" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">early evolutionary centers of the human</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:55.810" style="s2">are very much predicated on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.769" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">certainty of the survival function which</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.810" end="00:12:00.310" style="s2">has the fear of non survival and</p>

<p begin="00:12:00.310" end="00:12:05.709" style="s2">got to look at how that&#39;s developed over</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.529" end="00:12:08.110" style="s2">your life and how the fear of it not not</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.709" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">working out or not making it as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.110" end="00:12:13.959" style="s2">a conditioned reflex in us as we</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:17.740" style="s2">interact with the world and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.959" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">some personality psychologists and Tim</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.740" end="00:12:23.260" style="s2">wheeler Tim Leary in the 1960s actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:24.850" style="s2">developed a a circuit model of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.260" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">nervous system and consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">which the first four circuits he related</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:32.709" style="s2">to normal psychology the normal levels</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:36.070" style="s2">of development of human psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.709" end="00:12:39.070" style="s2">they were very much systems based on</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.070" end="00:12:42.070" style="s2">fear of not surviving fear of not</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.070" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">acquiring control of resources that kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.070" end="00:12:47.740" style="s2">of a thing fear of not understanding</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.269" end="00:12:56.740" style="s2">there are all these inherent fears and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">so the therapeutic process would ideally</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.740" end="00:13:02.550" style="s2">involve going back and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:04.870" style="s2">what it means to recognize how these</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.550" end="00:13:06.699" style="s2">areas of development have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.870" end="00:13:09.220" style="s2">conditioned throughout your life in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.699" end="00:13:11.230" style="s2">way that could be error-prone and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.220" end="00:13:14.010" style="s2">propensity for fear might be maximized</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.230" end="00:13:16.540" style="s2">if that error-prone so by going back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.010" end="00:13:20.230" style="s2">healing at each level you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.540" end="00:13:22.420" style="s2">okay what does it mean to overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.230" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">stress response system through yoga or</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.420" end="00:13:27.069" style="s2">martial arts or whatever so you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:28.870" style="s2">control when it&#39;s stimulated and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.069" end="00:13:31.060" style="s2">maintain a sense of control and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.870" end="00:13:32.829" style="s2">fear propensity is minimized and so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.060" end="00:13:34.660" style="s2">can master you know what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.829" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">maintain the master of your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.660" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">emotion regulation and to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:44.019" style="s2">your situation in the universe the sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">of logical analysis and language use at</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.019" end="00:13:47.529" style="s2">that level you know the greater</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.940" end="00:13:52.990" style="s2">integration the more you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.130" end="00:13:54.970" style="s2">overcome the inherent fears they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.990" end="00:13:57.819" style="s2">develop in our survival environment and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.970" end="00:14:00.579" style="s2">work towards going up them as little</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.819" end="00:14:01.950" style="s2">hierarchy towards self-actualization or</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.579" end="00:14:06.089" style="s2">individualization</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.950" end="00:14:08.339" style="s2">in fashion as Jung called it towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.089" end="00:14:10.950" style="s2">overcoming fear and embracing the love</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.339" end="00:14:13.139" style="s2">that can await us as we you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.950" end="00:14:15.899" style="s2">resonate with our environment the people</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.139" end="00:14:18.209" style="s2">in it and their journeys and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.899" end="00:14:20.180" style="s2">achieve some kind of a resonant state in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.209" end="00:14:23.630" style="s2">which love can really be embraced and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.180" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">actualized as a creative potentiality</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.630" end="00:14:39.000" style="s2">beautiful okay so we have many different</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:42.570" style="s2">aspects of ourselves that can be out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:47.160" style="s2">balance with each other that may be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.570" end="00:14:51.149" style="s2">better way to put it might be that some</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.160" end="00:14:52.889" style="s2">aspects of our psychology some things we</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.149" end="00:14:55.230" style="s2">come to think about the world that are</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.220" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">these higher potentialities so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.830" end="00:17:36.730" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to do is can is to present</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:40.040" style="s2">some of the bedrock conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.730" end="00:17:42.050" style="s2">sovereign or competent functioning is</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.510" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">here I&#39;d like to just reaffirm that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.800" end="00:18:00.020" style="s2">humans have incredible potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:03.980" style="s2">and this is something that isn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.020" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">apparent to themselves and it&#39;s only</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:11.510" style="s2">and create a safe kind of space for them</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.210" end="00:18:13.250" style="s2">to actually not feel like they need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.510" end="00:18:14.570" style="s2">be on guard and defensive that you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:17.660" style="s2">actually allow them to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.570" end="00:18:19.790" style="s2">themselves and look at what it means to</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.340" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">out okay what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.260" end="00:18:37.010" style="s2">you know if you were to keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:39.620" style="s2">what does that mean what can you change</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.810" end="00:19:18.500" style="s2">the chance to move beyond that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.760" end="00:19:20.120" style="s2">actually communicate on a more cerebral</p>

<p begin="00:19:42.470" end="00:19:48.980" style="s2">script and just enabling a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.980" end="00:19:51.890" style="s2">know that&#39;s the first step really you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.300" end="00:19:53.660" style="s2">know are they what are they capable or</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.890" end="00:19:56.600" style="s2">first you&#39;ve got to work with their</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.660" end="00:19:59.540" style="s2">capacity and accordingly with looking at</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.600" end="00:20:01.100" style="s2">what risks there are and what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.540" end="00:20:02.810" style="s2">maximize their health and well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.100" end="00:20:04.670" style="s2">the contents of their capacity but if</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.810" end="00:20:06.860" style="s2">they do have the capacity for self</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.670" end="00:20:08.600" style="s2">awareness you know how can you provide</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.600" end="00:20:12.200" style="s2">that requires the art of interacting in</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.200" end="00:20:17.299" style="s2">dynamic space and into a very valid</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.970" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">first line on your biome but I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.690" end="00:20:37.429" style="s2">how would you describe what it is you do</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:41.419" style="s2">when you feel if you can presence what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.429" end="00:20:43.279" style="s2">it is to feel most meaningfully connect</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.419" end="00:20:45.500" style="s2">like that the real meaningful output of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.279" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">that from we meet people when it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.500" end="00:20:48.740" style="s2">what you do you know what you do for</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:51.379" style="s2">work or what you do for this and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.740" end="00:20:53.259" style="s2">all of a sudden it&#39;s this weird moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.379" end="00:20:54.980" style="s2">of defining yourself often in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.259" end="00:20:57.080" style="s2">relationship to something that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.980" end="00:20:59.029" style="s2">that does not feel close to your heart</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.080" end="00:21:01.700" style="s2">or your soul does not feel close to what</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.029" end="00:21:04.909" style="s2">it really means for you to step forward</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.700" end="00:21:07.759" style="s2">with integrity feeling full of who you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.909" end="00:21:10.700" style="s2">are in an authentic way and it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.759" end="00:21:15.639" style="s2">I work as a copywriter saying oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.700" end="00:21:18.379" style="s2">okay cool I mean that&#39;s not quite how I</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.639" end="00:21:21.190" style="s2">experience my life day-to-day it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.379" end="00:21:24.860" style="s2">how I feel when I am most meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.190" end="00:21:28.340" style="s2">connected to myself and others so how</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.860" end="00:21:33.769" style="s2">how how would you describe what your</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.340" end="00:21:37.669" style="s2">role is if you were to speak to really</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.769" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">really the core meaning service that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.669" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">you&#39;re providing for people or to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.330" end="00:21:46.190" style="s2">greet which they&#39;ve got the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:47.899" style="s2">it just provide the space for them to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.190" end="00:21:52.730" style="s2">make connections within themselves and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.899" end="00:21:54.529" style="s2">meaningful and reframe things in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.730" end="00:21:57.220" style="s2">meaningful way such that they can go out</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.529" end="00:21:59.389" style="s2">into the world and change the way they</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.220" end="00:22:01.519" style="s2">impulsively react to situations or at</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.389" end="00:22:03.710" style="s2">least pause before they do react</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.519" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">impulsively and realize that hey this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.710" end="00:22:07.460" style="s2">um an impulse we&#39;ve looked at doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:09.289" style="s2">work for me I need to just do some</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.460" end="00:22:11.690" style="s2">breathing and bring myself into a more</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.690" end="00:22:15.529" style="s2">this dynamic or if I am in this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.909" end="00:22:16.039" style="s2">just say that I need to leave or keep it</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.529" end="00:22:18.409" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.039" end="00:22:20.360" style="s2">I know situations can escalate in that</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.360" end="00:22:25.080" style="s2">there there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.080" end="00:22:30.150" style="s2">because a lot of that dynamic space is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.780" end="00:22:34.050" style="s2">about you know disempowerment and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.150" end="00:22:36.600" style="s2">empowerment maybe tell us define what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.050" end="00:22:38.670" style="s2">you mean by dynamics a little bit so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.600" end="00:22:42.570" style="s2">can get more of a handle on it I guess</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.670" end="00:22:45.570" style="s2">it&#39;s an interpersonal kind of a mode of</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.370" end="00:24:32.019" style="s2">sort of slapping down</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.350" end="00:24:34.630" style="s2">something because it challenges what was</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.019" end="00:24:37.149" style="s2">a state of connection a state of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.630" end="00:24:39.009" style="s2">security you know we can pass apart</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.149" end="00:24:42.480" style="s2">security and connection but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.009" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">sense in which this something that seems</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.480" end="00:24:47.169" style="s2">somewhat relevant to hold them together</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:51.940" style="s2">there so it&#39;s how do we find how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.169" end="00:24:54.850" style="s2">develop the capacity to hold that space</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.940" end="00:24:56.769" style="s2">to recognize that space between stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.850" end="00:25:00.730" style="s2">and response so that then we can engage</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.769" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">in some kind of a new mode of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.730" end="00:25:07.299" style="s2">exploration or understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:08.830" style="s2">ourselves in that context maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.299" end="00:25:11.549" style="s2">come to understand our relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.830" end="00:25:15.250" style="s2">a particular drug a particular addictive</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.549" end="00:25:18.700" style="s2">cycle from a slightly new perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.250" end="00:25:20.740" style="s2">and then maybe begin to try and embed</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.700" end="00:25:22.840" style="s2">new behaviors there of course we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.740" end="00:25:24.909" style="s2">come across a new problem which is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.840" end="00:25:26.940" style="s2">the environment and the habitats that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.909" end="00:25:29.139" style="s2">were a part of might not exactly be</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.940" end="00:25:31.379" style="s2">allowing us so easily</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.139" end="00:25:33.669" style="s2">to change ourselves because of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.379" end="00:25:35.529" style="s2">these things is not like one little</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.669" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">moment of this connection and connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.529" end="00:25:39.639" style="s2">here there&#39;s so much noise around us all</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:42.730" style="s2">the time and even if we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.639" end="00:25:45.250" style="s2">about noise we&#39;re talking about just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.730" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">really deeply embedded environment and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.250" end="00:25:48.639" style="s2">history and culture that we&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:50.980" style="s2">and we can talk about family dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.639" end="00:25:52.929" style="s2">and aspects of the psyche that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.980" end="00:25:55.980" style="s2">play out in these kind of repeatable and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.929" end="00:25:58.779" style="s2">story-like ways and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.980" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">steeped into the very stone around us</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.779" end="00:26:07.000" style="s2">there are years of conditioned behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:08.259" style="s2">in relationship to certain objects in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.000" end="00:26:10.870" style="s2">relationship to certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.259" end="00:26:13.149" style="s2">gatherings in relationship to what it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.870" end="00:26:16.450" style="s2">to gather like we are now you know we</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.149" end="00:26:17.409" style="s2">can note the stage in front of us here</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.450" end="00:26:19.509" style="s2">and there&#39;s something a bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.409" end="00:26:22.210" style="s2">disconnecting about that to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.509" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">does seem to me to feel like that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.210" end="00:26:31.029" style="s2">I I feel like I have to talk outside of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:34.360" style="s2">myself a little bit just to reach out so</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.029" end="00:26:35.830" style="s2">to speak so that maybe so that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.360" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">there&#39;s something I can put out here</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.830" end="00:26:40.750" style="s2">that then we can both grasp together and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:42.340" style="s2">so something I&#39;m really quite interested</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.750" end="00:26:45.870" style="s2">in as I know we&#39;ve spoken about quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.340" end="00:26:50.169" style="s2">of times is what does it take to involve</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.870" end="00:26:52.750" style="s2">more and more people in sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.169" end="00:26:55.539" style="s2">we&#39;re doing right now which is doing our</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.750" end="00:26:57.220" style="s2">best to in a sense it feels a bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.539" end="00:26:58.990" style="s2">modeling because you know there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.220" end="00:27:02.020" style="s2">audience here and we&#39;re up here on stage</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.990" end="00:27:04.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s like we&#39;re modeling a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.020" end="00:27:06.309" style="s2">exploration for the purpose of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.090" end="00:27:08.950" style="s2">of value transmission but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.309" end="00:27:10.419" style="s2">transmission element to it that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.950" end="00:27:11.980" style="s2">of what we&#39;re used to in life you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.419" end="00:27:14.169" style="s2">we turn on TVs we get messages from</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.980" end="00:27:16.779" style="s2">radio we get taught things at school</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.169" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s often in a very top-down way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.779" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">not often the case that we really come</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:26.409" style="s2">into a sort of kind of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:31.299" style="s2">knowing with others where through a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.409" end="00:27:33.130" style="s2">collaboration what the wisdom is to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.299" end="00:27:35.649" style="s2">present at a really deep level that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.130" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">might only be able to be present by</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.649" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">putting six people together in such a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:41.409" style="s2">way that the some of them becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:45.100" style="s2">whole of them becomes more than the sum</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.409" end="00:27:47.580" style="s2">of their parts so something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.100" end="00:27:52.600" style="s2">interested in is how do we move from a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.580" end="00:27:58.090" style="s2">sort of a top-down message delivery to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.600" end="00:28:00.460" style="s2">genuine kind of involvement that more</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.090" end="00:28:01.240" style="s2">and more people can participate in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.460" end="00:28:03.610" style="s2">that&#39;s something we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.240" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">experiment with quite shortly in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.610" end="00:28:09.909" style="s2">second half of in the second half of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:11.500" style="s2">this evening but I know I sort of took</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.909" end="00:28:14.049" style="s2">the conversation from one place to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.500" end="00:28:16.659" style="s2">another here sort of talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.049" end="00:28:19.870" style="s2">stimulus response relationship and how</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.659" end="00:28:22.059" style="s2">that might be a bedrock of what to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.870" end="00:28:24.370" style="s2">recognize in order to cultivate your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.059" end="00:28:26.230" style="s2">capacity to enter into certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.370" end="00:28:28.779" style="s2">creative relationships with people and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.230" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">generally generally a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.779" end="00:28:33.340" style="s2">relationship with the world that&#39;s a key</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:35.890" style="s2">piece I wonder if there&#39;s anything else</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.340" end="00:28:40.690" style="s2">from your work with people who are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.890" end="00:28:43.210" style="s2">know particularly damaged with respect</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.690" end="00:28:45.460" style="s2">to their own sense of connectivity to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.210" end="00:28:47.650" style="s2">themselves and the world what other</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.460" end="00:28:52.780" style="s2">things have you found to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.650" end="00:28:55.210" style="s2">really crucial ingredients to building</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.780" end="00:28:59.650" style="s2">or enabling empowering human beings to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.210" end="00:29:01.540" style="s2">come more fully into themselves one</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.650" end="00:29:03.400" style="s2">thing that really needs to be developed</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.540" end="00:29:07.240" style="s2">so the degree to which an individual can</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.400" end="00:29:08.650" style="s2">is an internal locus of control so when</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.650" end="00:29:13.270" style="s2">there&#39;s the sense that something outside</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.600" end="00:29:15.370" style="s2">of me didn&#39;t cater to my needs so this</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:17.110" style="s2">is orientation towards the way other</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.960" end="00:29:29.740" style="s2">perpetuates very toxic dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.030" end="00:29:33.070" style="s2">generally speaking and very toxic</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.740" end="00:29:35.410" style="s2">personality complexes prisons are filled</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.070" end="00:29:37.000" style="s2">with people that have these complexes</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.410" end="00:29:39.040" style="s2">and their minds are blaming everyone but</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.940" end="00:31:25.350" style="s2">growth we can learn to actually master</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.609" end="00:31:27.299" style="s2">some of these destructive impulses and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.350" end="00:31:29.909" style="s2">turn them around into constructive</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.299" end="00:31:32.269" style="s2">outlets to actually grow our sense of</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.479" end="00:31:43.529" style="s2">progressive manner yeah that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.940" end="00:31:45.509" style="s2">there&#39;s so many things and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.529" end="00:31:48.749" style="s2">something that came up powerfully there</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.509" end="00:31:51.989" style="s2">is the notion that what enables us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.749" end="00:31:56.869" style="s2">have such potential is the very thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.989" end="00:32:00.109" style="s2">which makes us vulnerable to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.869" end="00:32:06.470" style="s2">manipulation and narrowing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.109" end="00:32:09.779" style="s2">ultimately torturing of it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.470" end="00:32:13.019" style="s2">that&#39;s something to sit with there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.779" end="00:32:18.919" style="s2">something deeply sad there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.019" end="00:32:23.399" style="s2">deeply sad about about potential</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.919" end="00:32:25.950" style="s2">unfulfilled and I suppose there are two</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.399" end="00:32:28.919" style="s2">components to that which are of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.950" end="00:32:30.659" style="s2">interrelated and in some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.919" end="00:32:33.960" style="s2">sense I think we could have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.659" end="00:32:37.259" style="s2">exploration where we spoke about these</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.960" end="00:32:39.059" style="s2">two components as together but I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.259" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">now we can take them apart a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.059" end="00:32:43.729" style="s2">and those two components are the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:46.470" style="s2">individual element and what can I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.729" end="00:32:49.979" style="s2">develop what&#39;s the agency I can develop</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.470" end="00:32:51.419" style="s2">in myself to become Who I am and then of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.979" end="00:32:54.889" style="s2">course also the habitats in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.419" end="00:32:58.019" style="s2">environment which we&#39;re a part of and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.889" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">do feel that part of why we&#39;re gathered</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.019" end="00:33:03.179" style="s2">here today it&#39;s certainly a motivating</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:05.630" style="s2">factor for me and it does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.179" end="00:33:08.790" style="s2">something that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.630" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">becoming a heightened sense in the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.790" end="00:33:17.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s becoming it&#39;s becoming a more</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:23.280" style="s2">and more prescient lurking and looming</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.900" end="00:33:24.870" style="s2">pulse shadow feeling and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.280" end="00:33:26.520" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the habitat</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.870" end="00:33:29.180" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the system that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.520" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">we&#39;re a part of there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.180" end="00:33:40.010" style="s2">the multi-layered system we&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:42.990" style="s2">that is not conducive to enabling the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.010" end="00:33:46.710" style="s2">realization of our potential not only</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.990" end="00:33:48.450" style="s2">individually but collectively the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.710" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">reality is the world has been this way</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.450" end="00:33:54.510" style="s2">for a very long time and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:57.390" style="s2">that there&#39;s sort of a top-down cabal of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.510" end="00:33:59.970" style="s2">elites that are necessarily responsible</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.390" end="00:34:01.590" style="s2">for all of this although there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.970" end="00:34:05.490" style="s2">certainly people in power who have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.590" end="00:34:08.760" style="s2">vested interest in maintaining where</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.490" end="00:34:11.730" style="s2">they are in that system of power but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.760" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">point fundamentally is that a system</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.730" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">itself can incentivize certain behavior</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:21.149" style="s2">in it and so it&#39;s this individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">element and then what is incentivized by</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.149" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">the habitat as it&#39;s been constructed</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">over many stimulus and response</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:32.990" style="s2">conditioned interactions over a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:36.429" style="s2">long period of time and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.990" end="00:34:41.649" style="s2">deep-seated sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.429" end="00:34:45.039" style="s2">where can I go what can I do how can I</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.649" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">really become who I feel I could be how</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.039" end="00:34:49.690" style="s2">can I love more how can I have more time</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:53.129" style="s2">with friends and family and big and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.690" end="00:34:56.260" style="s2">express myself in in a way that feels</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.129" end="00:34:59.559" style="s2">true but loving and not like I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.260" end="00:35:03.010" style="s2">to shut my eyes to aspects of the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.559" end="00:35:06.190" style="s2">which are cruel and perhaps ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.010" end="00:35:07.960" style="s2">necessary to support my current standard</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.190" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">of living in this world and in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.960" end="00:35:14.440" style="s2">society the fact is we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:17.559" style="s2">interconnected and the more in fact one</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.440" end="00:35:20.740" style="s2">comes into awareness of oneself them the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.559" end="00:35:26.740" style="s2">more I think one realizes the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.740" end="00:35:33.069" style="s2">that connectivity and that seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.740" end="00:35:36.039" style="s2">to be a huge huge thing and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.069" end="00:35:39.039" style="s2">that a lot is changing and has to change</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.039" end="00:35:42.069" style="s2">in really quite radical ways and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.039" end="00:35:43.779" style="s2">people know that you know obviously</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.069" end="00:35:46.359" style="s2">people know that hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.779" end="00:35:48.339" style="s2">of kids and people just on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.359" end="00:35:50.920" style="s2">the other week in Melbourne to protest</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.339" end="00:35:53.470" style="s2">climate extinction rebellion today as I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.920" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">mentioned before but there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.470" end="00:35:57.730" style="s2">which there&#39;s all this momentum for</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:36:02.559" style="s2">change but we&#39;re not actually sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.730" end="00:36:04.390" style="s2">really what to do and I wonder how and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.559" end="00:36:06.819" style="s2">the reason I&#39;m saying this is to bring</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.390" end="00:36:09.010" style="s2">it right back in again and to stress</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.819" end="00:36:11.349" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually it seems like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.010" end="00:36:17.140" style="s2">interpersonal capacity to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.349" end="00:36:20.890" style="s2">itself regarding difficult ideas in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.140" end="00:36:24.430" style="s2">context of what might scare you you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.890" end="00:36:27.640" style="s2">that your children or your loved ones or</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.430" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">your parents are not safe perhaps or</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.640" end="00:36:32.799" style="s2">that you might be complicit in someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:35.020" style="s2">else&#39;s child or parent not being safe in</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.799" end="00:36:37.900" style="s2">another part of the world these are</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.020" end="00:36:42.869" style="s2">things which call into question really</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.900" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">are very like the very substructure of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.869" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">the pillars of culture that support us</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.180" style="s2">and that we come to call home and form</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.210" end="00:36:53.270" style="s2">identity really</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.180" end="00:37:00.310" style="s2">ships with and so it&#39;s just why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.270" end="00:37:05.980" style="s2">so goddamn relevant to really engage in</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.310" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">you know in a deep sort of listening a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.980" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">quietening of the noise in your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:17.510" style="s2">and what emerges from then like I I</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:19.990" style="s2">really don&#39;t know I don&#39;t want to be up</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.510" end="00:37:23.510" style="s2">here speaking like this is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.990" end="00:37:25.340" style="s2">you know mountain that I&#39;ve climbed a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.510" end="00:37:28.070" style="s2">very far up it&#39;s really not like that at</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.340" end="00:37:32.150" style="s2">all this is really much more of an</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.070" end="00:37:38.090" style="s2">invitation over a sustained period of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.150" end="00:37:43.310" style="s2">time to come together and genuinely sit</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.090" end="00:37:44.780" style="s2">with what seems to be the case and even</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.310" end="00:37:45.800" style="s2">that sounds a bit too definitive I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.780" end="00:37:47.900" style="s2">saying we&#39;re going to crack what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.800" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">case is but what we can do is start to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.900" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">put together interesting maps of things</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:58.910" style="s2">and then feel what it&#39;s like to presence</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:38:01.550" style="s2">that and then maybe begin to put some</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.910" end="00:38:04.340" style="s2">pieces puts it put a few pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.550" end="00:38:05.950" style="s2">and find some sort of way we can be in</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.340" end="00:38:10.670" style="s2">relationship with each other that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.950" end="00:38:12.860" style="s2">somehow more somehow more real because</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.670" end="00:38:15.800" style="s2">there aren&#39;t such fundamental things</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.860" end="00:38:17.090" style="s2">we&#39;re avoiding and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.800" end="00:38:19.310" style="s2">that looks like I really really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.090" end="00:38:20.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a weight one big experiment but</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.310" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.510" end="00:38:23.660" style="s2">many people around the world engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">something similar and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.660" end="00:38:29.090" style="s2">possibility of involving what we might</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:30.590" style="s2">be able to create here with with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.090" end="00:38:31.340" style="s2">online world in different communities</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.590" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">around the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.340" end="00:38:35.900" style="s2">so anyway again I know I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">stepping away from a part of the flow in</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.900" end="00:38:41.990" style="s2">a conversation but I would like just to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:44.060" style="s2">try and bring things back to how we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.990" end="00:38:47.600" style="s2">in fact gathered here in an actual space</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.060" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">and we can engage with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.600" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">that&#39;s something I&#39;m really looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:55.790" style="s2">forward to doing in about 15 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">time so can I guess I guess moving</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.790" end="00:38:59.299" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:04.130" style="s2">you know might be two more questions</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.299" end="00:39:07.970" style="s2">left perhaps if there&#39;s something but</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.130" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">this if you can maybe talk to that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.970" end="00:39:14.510" style="s2">system or the habitat or elements of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:18.410" style="s2">environment that you find most in</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.069" end="00:39:41.869" style="s2">face on a daily basis the stimuli it can</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.280" end="00:39:43.730" style="s2">be completely overwhelming for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.869" end="00:39:46.190" style="s2">people and it does have a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.730" end="00:39:48.589" style="s2">point at which maybe it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.190" end="00:39:50.270" style="s2">function or sustain itself which is you</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.309" end="00:39:58.780" style="s2">streets and protest that one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.569" end="00:40:01.130" style="s2">comes to mind is what turns McKenna SID</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.780" end="00:40:03.829" style="s2">and this is a bit of a late but I will</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.130" end="00:40:06.170" style="s2">go back to the primal point here the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.829" end="00:40:09.859" style="s2">main thing is to remember is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.170" end="00:40:11.240" style="s2">trapped in some kind of a work of art so</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.859" end="00:40:13.549" style="s2">this is an ultimate point of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.240" end="00:40:16.760" style="s2">self-awareness and with that comes the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.549" end="00:40:19.250" style="s2">empowering sense of we can create an</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.760" end="00:40:21.079" style="s2">image of our potentiality in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.250" end="00:40:23.809" style="s2">way and the reason why I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.079" end="00:40:28.010" style="s2">passion for metaphor and art is because</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.809" end="00:40:31.700" style="s2">what can be represented is potential</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.010" end="00:40:35.089" style="s2">through the lens of looking at the</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.869" end="00:40:57.349" style="s2">we&#39;ve come out of the trees where there</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.609" end="00:41:00.230" style="s2">wasn&#39;t enough and now we&#39;ve actually got</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.230" end="00:41:05.990" style="s2">sense of knowledge of how to use that</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.760" end="00:41:25.900" style="s2">reassurance and comfort and a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.900" end="00:41:29.650" style="s2">we&#39;ve sacrificed so much when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.609" end="00:41:31.540" style="s2">at a harmonic connection with nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.650" end="00:41:33.609" style="s2">which seems to be essential for mental</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.170" end="00:43:11.960" style="s2">that in the metaphysics of being itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:15.710" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.180" end="00:43:31.250" style="s2">of this feeling that we are here</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.260" end="00:43:36.390" style="s2">involved with involved in we are it</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.250" end="00:43:37.770" style="s2">right it&#39;s not us somehow merely it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.390" end="00:43:39.960" style="s2">seems to me at least that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.770" end="00:43:42.770" style="s2">merely contingent on a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.960" end="00:43:44.730" style="s2">stuff although of course we are meant</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.770" end="00:43:48.119" style="s2">emergent from it in some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.730" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">sense but we are it expressing itself we</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.119" end="00:43:58.350" style="s2">are expressions of reality itself and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:59.970" style="s2">and so therefore there is something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.350" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">you know and I have not making this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.970" end="00:44:03.420" style="s2">argument I of course but really what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:07.140" style="s2">trying to communicate with with us with</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.420" end="00:44:10.290" style="s2">a sense of feeling is that there seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.140" end="00:44:13.310" style="s2">to be and there seems there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.290" end="00:44:16.080" style="s2">something in the nature of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.310" end="00:44:21.240" style="s2">experience itself and live itself and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.080" end="00:44:24.650" style="s2">listen and quieten which can enact or</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.240" end="00:44:29.730" style="s2">enable a deep sense of participation</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.650" end="00:44:33.990" style="s2">with reality itself which seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.730" end="00:44:37.410" style="s2">good bet as the key towards involving</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.990" end="00:44:40.290" style="s2">ourselves again with a cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.410" end="00:44:41.970" style="s2">participation in the world that looks to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.290" end="00:44:44.790" style="s2">be moving towards the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.970" end="00:44:46.350" style="s2">harmony at least a little bit so to put</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.790" end="00:44:51.240" style="s2">that in a way that&#39;s hopefully a bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.350" end="00:44:55.260" style="s2">more simple there&#39;s a level of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.240" end="00:44:57.180" style="s2">much deeper much more primary to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.260" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">level of knowing associated with beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.180" end="00:45:01.290" style="s2">at this level up here but I am sitting</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:03.930" style="s2">here that the world works in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.290" end="00:45:07.470" style="s2">particular way right I&#39;m a human being</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.930" end="00:45:10.740" style="s2">with these sort of properties before we</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.470" end="00:45:14.040" style="s2">form symbolic representation even</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.740" end="00:45:15.030" style="s2">perhaps before we do representation</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.030" end="00:45:18.540" style="s2">maybe not that&#39;s that&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.500" end="00:45:20.190" style="s2">metaphysical question it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.540" end="00:45:21.750" style="s2">connection and disconnection seems to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.190" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">happen deep because it&#39;s involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.750" end="00:45:26.849" style="s2">very the very realization of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:28.890" style="s2">transformation and development this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.849" end="00:45:31.829" style="s2">something we actually have to accept our</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.829" end="00:45:36.450" style="s2">and to come into and awaken to different</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.990" end="00:45:38.849" style="s2">parts of ourselves right there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.450" end="00:45:41.790" style="s2">in which there&#39;s a sense in which it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.609" end="00:45:58.680" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a sense in which to</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.680" end="00:46:04.579" style="s2">is to well is to let go in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.300" end="00:46:07.050" style="s2">that looks a little bit like a</p>

<p begin="00:46:07.050" end="00:46:10.980" style="s2">not so not so simple I know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:46:48.359" end="00:46:53.309" style="s2">held that has to be in touch with we</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:59.880" style="s2">have to be in touch with that should we</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.309" end="00:47:01.950" style="s2">I think really wished to presence the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.880" end="00:47:07.470" style="s2">beginnings of solutions to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.950" end="00:47:12.510" style="s2">problems we face so yeah I guess in</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.470" end="00:47:15.450" style="s2">closing and come what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.510" end="00:47:19.380" style="s2">this idea of participatory knowing this</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.450" end="00:47:21.510" style="s2">way of feeling into the very depths the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.380" end="00:47:24.839" style="s2">depths of who we are or allowing the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.510" end="00:47:29.430" style="s2">depths of what we are to emerge through</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.839" end="00:47:31.290" style="s2">our well it&#39;s our potential emerging</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.430" end="00:47:33.689" style="s2">through this deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.290" end="00:47:36.519" style="s2">connectivity with</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.689" end="00:47:38.499" style="s2">the flow of that around us it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.519" end="00:47:42.099" style="s2">affected by everything around us and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.499" end="00:47:46.959" style="s2">become conduits for what then is an</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.099" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">expression of a whole beyond just how we</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.959" end="00:47:50.890" style="s2">would conceptualize ourselves at the ego</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:58.089" style="s2">level maybe at the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.890" end="00:48:01.029" style="s2">itself your self-awareness and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.089" end="00:48:03.849" style="s2">flow States through physical action in</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.029" end="00:48:06.489" style="s2">the world engaging in a meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.849" end="00:48:09.429" style="s2">very essential and just a touch on some</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.489" end="00:48:12.339" style="s2">of those things you mentioned one</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.429" end="00:48:14.619" style="s2">important concepts that brings together</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.339" end="00:48:16.959" style="s2">a lot of things I think is inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.619" end="00:48:18.849" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to find what inspires</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.959" end="00:48:21.309" style="s2">ourselves and we&#39;ve got to repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.849" end="00:48:24.339" style="s2">like a diet you know because it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.309" end="00:48:27.549" style="s2">that which is inspiring that allows us</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.339" end="00:48:30.130" style="s2">to move through that darkness you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.549" end="00:48:33.399" style="s2">there&#39;s so much discomfort and distress</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.130" end="00:48:36.130" style="s2">that we need this reference to</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.399" end="00:48:38.319" style="s2">inspiration or an image of the ideal of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.130" end="00:48:40.479" style="s2">what we could be if we were to enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.319" end="00:48:42.969" style="s2">that can get us to the place that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.479" end="00:48:45.669" style="s2">want to be so I always like to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.969" end="00:48:49.989" style="s2">that we need to find what inspires us</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.669" end="00:48:54.989" style="s2">whether it&#39;s quotes art the idea of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.989" end="00:48:57.759" style="s2">ideal self the idea of love of</p>

<p begin="00:48:57.759" end="00:49:03.849" style="s2">or affirmation inspires you needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:07.539" style="s2">the conduit through which you relate to</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.849" end="00:49:10.749" style="s2">the world as you face discomfort turmoil</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.539" end="00:49:13.239" style="s2">distress whatever it might be and having</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.749" end="00:49:15.549" style="s2">that as a reference allows you to endure</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.239" end="00:49:18.579" style="s2">that a little bit more and that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.549" end="00:49:22.929" style="s2">meaningful the endurance the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.579" end="00:49:25.299" style="s2">sort of be present you know to get into</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.929" end="00:49:27.909" style="s2">this flow of affirmation with reference</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.299" end="00:49:30.669" style="s2">to this inspirational thing this image</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.909" end="00:49:33.039" style="s2">or quote whatever it might be for you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.669" end="00:49:34.719" style="s2">and to practice there on a daily basis</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.039" end="00:49:37.979" style="s2">you&#39;re making connections in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.719" end="00:49:40.929" style="s2">and you&#39;re actually overcoming a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.979" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">the impulses that would otherwise weigh</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.929" end="00:49:45.909" style="s2">you down you know that the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:46.390" style="s2">the cocoon of darkness as we go through</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.909" end="00:49:48.700" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.390" end="00:49:51.369" style="s2">mark of trying to survive the basic</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.700" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">conditions of this planet this ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.369" end="00:49:56.289" style="s2">this social container economic container</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.630" end="00:50:03.640" style="s2">metamorphosis are we gonna have if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.240" end="00:50:06.940" style="s2">don&#39;t find what it means to actually</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.940" end="00:50:10.990" style="s2">minds in such a way that we can emerge</p>
