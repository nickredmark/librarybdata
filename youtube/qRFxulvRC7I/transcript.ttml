<p begin="00:00:00.320" end="00:00:07.830" style="s2">Okay, so today we&#39;re going to talk about openness.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:16.710" style="s2">Now, you might say in some sense that openness<br />is the last discovered of the big five traits,</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:23.510" style="s2">and it&#39;s also the one that comes up most weakly<br />in the factor analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.510" end="00:00:31.839" style="s2">When Hans Eysenck formulated his trait representation<br />which was extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism,</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.839" end="00:00:42.680" style="s2">he felt that he encapsulated all of the fundamental<br />variation in human personality and he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.680" end="00:00:46.870" style="s2">loathe to include intelligence as a personality<br />trait.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.870" end="00:00:54.190" style="s2">Now, the relationship between psychoticism<br />and openness is rather complex.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.190" end="00:00:58.330" style="s2">Eysenck basically felt that people could be<br />extraverted and that would be the positive</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.330" end="00:01:02.500" style="s2">dimension, and could be high in negative emotion<br />and that would be the negative emotion dimension,</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.500" end="00:01:08.420" style="s2">and that they could also have a predisposition<br />to psychosis.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.420" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">He was thinking about the brain systems that<br />underlie schizophrenia and that tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:23.750" style="s2">dissociate and develop hallucinations, but<br />also maybe the systems in human beings that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.750" end="00:01:29.270" style="s2">are affected by hallucinogenic drugs, which<br />seem to affect human beings differently than</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.270" end="00:01:31.930" style="s2">they affect other creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.930" end="00:01:39.290" style="s2">Eysenck&#39;s psychoticism eventually was broken<br />down into low agreeableness and low conscientiousness--it</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.290" end="00:01:43.510" style="s2">didn&#39;t predict the predisposition to psychosis<br />at all.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.510" end="00:01:50.509" style="s2">And later factor analysis found that you could<br />load out intelligence and creativity as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.509" end="00:01:52.670" style="s2">personality dimension separately.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.670" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">Now, it&#39;s a bit tricky because you have IQ<br />measures and IQ measures are much more direct</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:01.659" style="s2">measures of intelligence then the personality<br />measures.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.659" end="00:02:05.960" style="s2">I mean the personality measure is something<br />like: do you think you&#39;re smart?</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.960" end="00:02:12.830" style="s2">You know, I&#39;m being a bit flippant about that<br />because it&#39;s more sophisticated than that,</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.830" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">but when you talk about someone as a smart<br />person, you&#39;re generally referring to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:19.690" style="s2">trait that we would describe as openness.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.690" end="00:02:26.550" style="s2">You also are doing that when you refer to<br />creativity as a predisposition.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.550" end="00:02:32.440" style="s2">And you can measure the smart part a lot better<br />with IQ, and IQ is also a pretty good predictor</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.440" end="00:02:34.850" style="s2">of creativity.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.850" end="00:02:38.750" style="s2">Well, so let&#39;s see how they&#39;re associated.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.750" end="00:02:46.840" style="s2">You remember that you have your big two traits--stability<br />and plasticity--and stability breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.840" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">into conscientiousness, emotional stability,<br />and agreeableness.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">And then you can see how each of the aspects<br />are correlated--how highly they&#39;re correlated.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:03:00.410" style="s2">So industriousness and orderliness at about<br />.4, volatility and withdrawal in emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.410" end="00:03:07.030" style="s2">stability--or neuroticism actually--about<br />.6, and agreeableness and politeness at about</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.030" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">.4.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">And then the next trait is extraversion and<br />openness--that makes plasticity--and people</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.240" style="s2">who are high in plasticity tend to be good<br />entrepreneurs, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.240" end="00:03:29.270" style="s2">And extraversion breaks into assertiveness<br />and enthusiasm, correlated at about .5, and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.270" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">then openness and intelligence--the correlation<br />there is lower--it&#39;s .35.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">The average correlation between the big 5<br />is .2, and the correlation between the big</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">two is about .2.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">And so you have to remember, you might ask<br />yourself, well is a correlation of .4 twice</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:49.850" style="s2">as large as a correlation of .2?</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.850" end="00:03:54.650" style="s2">And the answer to that is no, because you<br />have to square them to compare them arithmetically.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.650" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">So a correlation of .2 gives you .04, 4% squared,<br />and a correlation of .4 gives you 16% squared,</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:07.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s actually a difference of a factor<br />of 4.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.720" end="00:04:14.260" style="s2">And so you need to remember that when you&#39;re<br />considering effect sizes so that you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.260" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">exactly what they mean.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">Now, if you&#39;re accounting for 16% of the variance<br />which would be a correlation of .4, then that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:24.310" style="s2">leaves 84% left unexplained.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">But that&#39;s a bit of an overstatement most<br />of the time in psychology because our measures</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">are rather imperfect and so, for example,<br />if you give someone a personality test and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:45.550" style="s2">let&#39;s say that the validity of their self<br />report is about .6 or .7, which is probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.550" end="00:04:51.980" style="s2">what it is--maybe it might be a little bit<br />higher than that--that means that their self-report</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.980" end="00:04:56.380" style="s2">is only picking up 50% of the variation in<br />their personality.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.380" end="00:05:05.180" style="s2">And if an R derived from that measure accounts<br />for 16% of the variance, in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.180" end="00:05:07.220" style="s2">twice as powerful as it appears to be.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.220" end="00:05:09.230" style="s2">Because the measure is so error-ridden.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.230" end="00:05:13.920" style="s2">And a lot of the things that we measure in<br />psychology are error-ridden, and what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.920" end="00:05:18.260" style="s2">means is that the correlations--generally<br />what it means, although not invariably--is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:20.620" style="s2">that the correlations are bigger than they<br />look.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.620" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">In any case, the correlations that come up<br />in personality research are certainly big</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:32.460" style="s2">enough to be meaningful, and I would say meaningful<br />in terms of predicting major life outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.460" end="00:05:41.590" style="s2">and predicting important economic outcomes<br />and that sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.590" end="00:05:46.180" style="s2">One of the things you might ask yourself is,<br />exactly what does intelligence measure?</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.180" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">So we&#39;ll start with intelligence, and that<br />would be equivalent to intellect roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:05:58.310" style="s2">So intellect in the big 5, the aspect seems<br />to be associated with interest in ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.310" end="00:06:05.800" style="s2">Whereas the openness proper aspect seems to<br />be associated with aesthetic sensibility and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.800" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">creativity.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:10.160" style="s2">That&#39;s the best way to think about it, as<br />far as we&#39;ve been able to figure out.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.160" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">And the biggest relationship is between intellect<br />and intelligence, as measured psychometrically.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:19.980" style="s2">Now, intelligence is an interesting concept.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.980" end="00:06:22.460" style="s2">It&#39;s very controversial.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.460" end="00:06:29.900" style="s2">In fact, one of the things that continually<br />happens over and over again in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:35.550" style="s2">is that psychologists discover all sorts of<br />new kinds of intelligence, and the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:39.830" style="s2">two proponents of that sort of thing I suppose<br />were Bob Sternberg, who came up with this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.830" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">thing he called practical intelligence, and<br />then Howard Gardner, who came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:48.930" style="s2">theory of multiple intelligences, which had<br />a very large effect on educational psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.930" end="00:06:52.210" style="s2">when the theory was first proposed.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.210" end="00:06:57.530" style="s2">And that&#39;s not saying much because, generally<br />speaking, it&#39;s very difficult to find a discipline</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.530" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">that&#39;s more susceptible to fads than educational<br />psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:06.900" style="s2">As far as I can tell, generally speaking,<br />each fad is worse than the previous one.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.900" end="00:07:15.640" style="s2">So, Gardner posited that, I think there were<br />7 or 8 different intelligences: linguistic,</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.640" end="00:07:23.470" style="s2">musical, logical, mathematical, spatial, body/kinaesthetic,<br />intrapersonal, and interpersonal.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.470" end="00:07:28.110" style="s2">And people talk about emotional intelligence<br />and they talk about practical intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.110" end="00:07:31.510" style="s2">As far as I&#39;m concerned, all of that&#39;s complete<br />rubbish.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.510" end="00:07:33.710" style="s2">And there&#39;s technical reasons for that.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.710" end="00:07:37.170" style="s2">I mean, there&#39;s technical and philosophical<br />reasons for that.</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.170" end="00:07:40.740" style="s2">The first thing is, you can&#39;t just mess up<br />a word.</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.740" end="00:07:44.910" style="s2">You know, the whole point of having a word<br />is so that it defines some things, it describes</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.910" end="00:07:47.669" style="s2">some things, and doesn&#39;t describe other things,<br />right.</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.669" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">And so you can make the word intelligence<br />account for whatever you want.</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:59.510" style="s2">And so you can say that the ability to dance<br />is a form of intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.510" end="00:08:02.630" style="s2">But the problem with that is you blur out<br />the word so badly, you can&#39;t tell what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.630" end="00:08:04.030" style="s2">means anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.030" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">And so I would also point out: we had perfectly<br />good words for those major intelligences.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:10.730" style="s2">We called them talents.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.730" end="00:08:15.980" style="s2">And so it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to make a<br />distinction between a talent and intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.980" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">Now you might say, well how the hell do you<br />know the difference?</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:24.780" style="s2">If things look similar to some degree, then<br />how do you know if they&#39;re the same or different?</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.780" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">Well that&#39;s exactly what you do when you do<br />the construct validity process.</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:33.640" style="s2">So let&#39;s say you rated a number of people<br />on their dancing ability.</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.640" end="00:08:39.010" style="s2">And then you rated a number of people on their<br />ability to multiply two two-digit numbers</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.010" end="00:08:40.530" style="s2">in their head quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.530" end="00:08:47.110" style="s2">Well then, you see technically, if both of<br />those were intelligences, then the people</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:52.550" style="s2">who could dance better could multiply two-digit<br />numbers faster in their head.</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.550" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">They would be slightly positively-- *coughs*<br />--see that&#39;s what happens when I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:04.290" style="s2">any diet coke.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.290" end="00:09:11.570" style="s2">So anyways, if intelligence was the right<br />word to subsume both of those, then what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.570" end="00:09:13.230" style="s2">see is there&#39;d be a high correlation.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.230" end="00:09:17.000" style="s2">The people who were good dancers would also<br />be the ones who could multiply most rapidly--I</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.000" end="00:09:24.330" style="s2">mean multiply in their head.</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.330" end="00:09:29.380" style="s2">But you&#39;re not going to be able to extract<br />out a single factor like that.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.380" end="00:09:33.470" style="s2">It&#39;s just not the case that those things associate<br />like that.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.470" end="00:09:46.510" style="s2">So for something to be one phenomena, the<br />things that it-- *coughs* -- obviously I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.510" end="00:09:50.620" style="s2">talked too much this semester.</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.620" end="00:09:56.330" style="s2">All the things that are subsumed under that<br />definition have to be correlated.</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.330" end="00:09:57.550" style="s2">And highly correlated.</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.550" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">Because otherwise they&#39;re not the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">It&#39;s the definition of the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2">Now IQ is a very peculiar construct, a very<br />unique construct from a psychological perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.480" end="00:10:17.770" style="s2">But also, more generally, from a social science<br />perspective because IQ has the most predictive</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.770" end="00:10:23.570" style="s2">validity of anything ever discovered in the<br />social sciences, period.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.570" end="00:10:31.310" style="s2">Now the other thing that is interesting about<br />IQ is that a lot of the people who were interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.310" end="00:10:37.690" style="s2">early in the measure of intelligence were<br />engineers turned psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.690" end="00:10:41.630" style="s2">And the engineers have actually had quite<br />a whopping effect on psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.630" end="00:10:46.390" style="s2">Part of the reason that psychology has an<br />advanced methodology and advances statistical</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.390" end="00:10:51.291" style="s2">techniques is because we got invaded by engineers<br />in the early part of the 20th century, and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.291" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">so the engineers made our measurements much<br />more rigorous than they would have otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:10:57.710" style="s2">been and it&#39;s been a huge advantage.</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.710" end="00:11:01.730" style="s2">I mean, one of the things that&#39;s happening<br />to psychology is that it&#39;s starting to eat</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.730" end="00:11:03.690" style="s2">other disciplines.</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.690" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">It&#39;s had a massive effect on economics and<br />it&#39;s going to have a massive effect on political</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:09.000" style="s2">science.</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.000" end="00:11:11.620" style="s2">And the reason for that is because we know<br />how to measure things, and it actually turns</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.620" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">out to matter that you know how to measure<br />things.</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:19.890" style="s2">Obviously, I mean if you&#39;re going to be talking<br />about something that&#39;s specific and well-defined,</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.890" end="00:11:24.670" style="s2">first of all, if you can&#39;t make it specific<br />and well-defined, all you can really do is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.670" end="00:11:26.460" style="s2">argue about it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.460" end="00:11:33.190" style="s2">And there are better and worse arguments,<br />but the problem is that just because an argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.190" end="00:11:36.140" style="s2">is good doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right.</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.140" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">And that&#39;s a big problem.</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:40.670" style="s2">It&#39;s also something to remember when you&#39;re<br />arguing about people that you have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.670" end="00:11:44.690" style="s2">with because if you happen to be better at<br />structuring your arguments and you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.690" end="00:11:49.000" style="s2">verbally fluent, and perhaps more assertive<br />and perhaps less agreeable, you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.000" end="00:11:51.250" style="s2">win the argument.</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.250" end="00:11:53.160" style="s2">But that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re right.</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.160" end="00:11:55.500" style="s2">Unfortunately it&#39;s not that simple.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.500" end="00:12:04.370" style="s2">And so as far as I can tell, the empirical<br />process is restricting or eliminating the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.370" end="00:12:09.350" style="s2">catastrophically detrimental effects of pure<br />theory.</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.350" end="00:12:14.040" style="s2">Well, and our measurement techniques have<br />been pretty good about that.</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.040" end="00:12:16.830" style="s2">Okay so now what happens with IQ here?</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.830" end="00:12:23.000" style="s2">I can define IQ for you just so you know what<br />it is.</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.000" end="00:12:27.029" style="s2">Imagine that you had a library of questions.</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.029" end="00:12:29.220" style="s2">So here&#39;s some questions.</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.220" end="00:12:34.420" style="s2">There&#39;s millions of questions in this data<br />bank.</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.420" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">What&#39;s 2 times 68?</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:37.170" style="s2">What&#39;s the capital of Georgia?</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.170" end="00:12:40.149" style="s2">What&#39;s the definition of hypertrixanemia?</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.149" end="00:12:46.490" style="s2">What comes after in this sequence: 2, 4, 8,<br />16?</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.490" end="00:12:50.450" style="s2">Remember these numbers--so I&#39;d tell you the<br />numbers and you&#39;d have to tell me them back--2,</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.450" end="00:12:54.700" style="s2">4, 1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 12, 15, 14, 18, 20, 22.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.700" end="00:13:02.630" style="s2">And then I might ask you, in fact, to remember<br />them backwards, and that&#39;s a working memory</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.630" end="00:13:03.630" style="s2">test.</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.630" end="00:13:09.899" style="s2">Okay, so those are all questions that require<br />abstraction and mental operations: that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.899" end="00:13:11.510" style="s2">the key as far as I can tell.</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.510" end="00:13:16.670" style="s2">So you might say, exactly what constitutes<br />an abstraction?</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.670" end="00:13:21.740" style="s2">And it looks to me like what an abstraction<br />is--there&#39;s the capacity to formulate an abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.740" end="00:13:23.982" style="s2">and there&#39;s the capacity to manipulate them.</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.982" end="00:13:28.730" style="s2">To formulate an abstraction, I think what<br />you do is you take a phenomena and you represent</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.730" end="00:13:31.220" style="s2">it with something that&#39;s low resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.220" end="00:13:32.750" style="s2">That&#39;s more or less what an abstraction is.</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.750" end="00:13:42.150" style="s2">So, for example, if I imagine this classroom<br />later, my imagined representation is going</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.150" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">to be of much lower resolution than the actual<br />classroom, but it&#39;s sufficient for certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:49.240" style="s2">purposes.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.240" end="00:13:53.300" style="s2">Just like a thumbnail on a computer is sufficient<br />for certain purposes.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.300" end="00:14:01.290" style="s2">And then once I simplify the phenomena in<br />question, then I can also perform certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.290" end="00:14:09.459" style="s2">operations on it, say, in imagination or semantically,<br />and the capacity to generate that abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.459" end="00:14:14.890" style="s2">and the ability to manipulate those seems<br />to be the core element of intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.890" end="00:14:21.959" style="s2">And I think part of the reason why intelligence,<br />roughly speaking, is a human dimension--although</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.959" end="00:14:28.290" style="s2">obviously you can to some degree rank order<br />animals in terms of their capacity to learn,</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.290" end="00:14:33.910" style="s2">but there&#39;s this whopping differentiation<br />between human beings and animals in this area</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.910" end="00:14:36.910" style="s2">particularly--is because we can use abstractions.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.910" end="00:14:42.709" style="s2">Now, I heard a woman named Temple Grandin<br />speak once and it was a very interesting talk.</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.709" end="00:14:51.160" style="s2">She&#39;s very autistic, but very brilliant, which<br />is not very common for people who are autistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.160" end="00:14:54.730" style="s2">because usually it&#39;s associated with a substantial<br />amount of intellectual impairment.</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.730" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">But she also had an extraordinarily devoted<br />parent who spent almost all her time trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:04.960" style="s2">to pull her daughter out of her autistic isolation.</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.960" end="00:15:11.140" style="s2">Now Grandin has gone on to become a University<br />of Chicago professor--and she works in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.140" end="00:15:18.279" style="s2">agricultural area--and she has redesigned<br />the chutes, the walkways basically, that take</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.279" end="00:15:19.770" style="s2">cattle to the slaughter house.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.770" end="00:15:24.270" style="s2">And she&#39;s done that to make them much less<br />stressful for the animals.</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.270" end="00:15:27.649" style="s2">And part of the reason she can do that, as<br />far as she&#39;s concerned, is because she thinks</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.649" end="00:15:29.240" style="s2">like an animal.</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.240" end="00:15:34.470" style="s2">And what that means, as far as she can tell,<br />is that she cannot generate an abstraction--not</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.470" end="00:15:35.740" style="s2">easily.</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.740" end="00:15:40.500" style="s2">Now she can speak so obviously she learned<br />to do it to some degree, but she talked more</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.500" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">about deficits in imagination or concretization<br />of imagination.</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:49.470" style="s2">So one of the weird things that you see with<br />autistic kids, not frequently but now and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.470" end="00:15:52.630" style="s2">then--there&#39;s actually a famous example of<br />this on the web.</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.630" end="00:15:56.450" style="s2">There&#39;s a guy, I think he&#39;s from Britain,<br />and you can take him in a helicopter and fly</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.450" end="00:16:02.370" style="s2">him over a city, and then he can stand in<br />front of a piece of paper, like 12x8, start</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.370" end="00:16:06.750" style="s2">anywhere, and draw the entire city.</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.750" end="00:16:11.339" style="s2">Now and then you see autistic savants who<br />are children who can draw perfectly realistically,</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.339" end="00:16:16.310" style="s2">and so maybe they&#39;ll draw a horse and they<br />don&#39;t even start the horse like a kid would--like</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.310" end="00:16:20.301" style="s2">a normal kid would sketch the outline of the<br />horse and put some eyes in.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.301" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">They put some eyes in and make the horse perfectly<br />detailed.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:34.760" style="s2">And what Grandin claimed was that-- she said<br />okay, you think of &quot;house&quot; or think of &quot;church&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.760" end="00:16:37.130" style="s2">And she says, what comes to mind if you think<br />of church?</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.130" end="00:16:41.230" style="s2">And maybe she&#39;d say, well you get this little<br />image of something that&#39;s sort of shaped like</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.230" end="00:16:46.310" style="s2">this with a steeped on top or a cross or something<br />like that, and that&#39;s a church.</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.310" end="00:16:49.540" style="s2">And so maybe you think of house and it&#39;s like<br />a little kid&#39;s house.</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.540" end="00:16:54.010" style="s2">It&#39;s got a rectangle and a parallelogram--that&#39;s<br />not a parallelogram, whatever the hell you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.010" end="00:16:58.620" style="s2">call that thing on the top--and then it&#39;s<br />got a chimney with smoke coming out of it,</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.620" end="00:16:59.620" style="s2">right.</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.620" end="00:17:00.620" style="s2">Two windows and a door.</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.620" end="00:17:01.620" style="s2">House.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.620" end="00:17:03.140" style="s2">Yeah, but there are no houses like that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.140" end="00:17:07.139" style="s2">Each individual house looks a lot different<br />than that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.139" end="00:17:10.879" style="s2">And so in order to have that conception of<br />house, essentially what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.879" end="00:17:16.179" style="s2">you have to take that class of all possible<br />houses and extract out the features that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.179" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">common across all of them.</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:20.329" style="s2">And that&#39;s an abstraction.</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.329" end="00:17:24.699" style="s2">And so, as far as Grandin&#39;s concerned, she<br />doesn&#39;t have abstractions like that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.699" end="00:17:28.470" style="s2">When you ask her to think of &quot;church&quot;, she<br />remembers &quot;a church&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.470" end="00:17:31.950" style="s2">It&#39;s always singular instances.</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.950" end="00:17:38.739" style="s2">Now the thing about human beings is that we<br />perceive singular instances to some degree,</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.739" end="00:17:43.220" style="s2">although I think our abstraction capacity<br />often interferes with our ability to do that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.220" end="00:17:45.859" style="s2">But we also perceive abstractions.</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.859" end="00:17:49.110" style="s2">And you can kind of tell this if you&#39;re ever<br />trying to learn to draw.</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.110" end="00:17:51.279" style="s2">Like if I say, draw a hand.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.279" end="00:17:56.179" style="s2">You guys, most of you unless you have artistic<br />training, you&#39;re going to draw what&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.179" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">a hieroglyphic hand.</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:02.489" style="s2">I think the drawings that children come up<br />with aren&#39;t drawings; I think they&#39;re hieroglyphs.</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.489" end="00:18:06.369" style="s2">They&#39;re abstracted representations that are<br />quasi-linguistic.</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.369" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">They&#39;re not artwork, they&#39;re proto-language.</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:13.340" style="s2">And hieroglyphs of course were one of the<br />earliest forms of written language.</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.340" end="00:18:17.559" style="s2">It makes sense, because if you want to communicate<br />about something, why not draw an image.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.559" end="00:18:19.830" style="s2">And eventually the image turns into a word.</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.830" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">But I actually think that&#39;s the developmental<br />progression of language among human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.489" style="s2">It&#39;s the abstracted image first and then it&#39;s<br />the word.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.489" end="00:18:34.789" style="s2">Anyways, if you drew a hand, you&#39;d likely<br />draw a hieroglyphic hand: 5 fingers or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.789" end="00:18:37.909" style="s2">even 4, right, because that&#39;s what animators<br />do.</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.909" end="00:18:41.309" style="s2">You can&#39;t fit all those sausages on one circle.</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.309" end="00:18:44.049" style="s2">So they just simplify it down to 4 and no<br />one even cares.</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.049" end="00:18:50.299" style="s2">You watch an animated program, which is highly<br />abstracted--I mean Homer Simpson looks nothing</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.299" end="00:18:51.809" style="s2">like an actual person.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.809" end="00:18:57.080" style="s2">Like really tremendously unlike an actual<br />person, and it&#39;s completely irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.080" end="00:19:00.030" style="s2">After two or three seconds it doesn&#39;t matter<br />at all.</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.030" end="00:19:05.379" style="s2">Which is also why I think 3D movies--it&#39;s<br />never a technology that&#39;s ever caught on.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.379" end="00:19:07.860" style="s2">Because after the first 4 seconds, who the<br />hell cares.</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.860" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">It&#39;s irrelevant whether you see in three dimensions<br />because you don&#39;t need much information to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:14.860" style="s2">actually structure your perception.</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.860" end="00:19:18.850" style="s2">Now if you want to see your hand--weirdly<br />enough--so that you can draw it, you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.850" end="00:19:21.379" style="s2">to snap out of your normal mode of perception.</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.379" end="00:19:25.570" style="s2">I find often it&#39;s a lot easier to do that<br />with one eye closed because it flattens it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.570" end="00:19:26.570" style="s2">out.</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.570" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">And then you have to stop looking at your<br />hand as if it&#39;s a hand.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:31.409" style="s2">You have to look at it again like it&#39;s an<br />object.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.409" end="00:19:35.100" style="s2">And as soon as you do that it&#39;s actually rather<br />shocking because it&#39;s such a strange looking</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.100" end="00:19:36.100" style="s2">thing.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.100" end="00:19:40.639" style="s2">If you put your hand in a non-canonical position<br />*gestures* --that&#39;s a canonical position,</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.639" end="00:19:45.640" style="s2">I would say--if you put your hand in a non-canonical<br />position and then look at it, it&#39;s the weirdest</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.640" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">shaped thing.</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:48.609" style="s2">It&#39;s quite shocking to see it, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.609" end="00:19:52.049" style="s2">And then you can draw it--once you can actually<br />see it like that--but before that, you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.049" end="00:19:55.279" style="s2">pretty much stuck in &quot;hand&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.279" end="00:20:01.960" style="s2">So anyways, I think what happens with intelligence<br />is that people are capable of abstracting</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.960" end="00:20:03.859" style="s2">and then they can manipulate abstractions.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.859" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">And so let&#39;s take another look at what abstractions<br />might be.</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:13.909" style="s2">Now part of the reason that I think abstraction<br />is so useful is because things are really</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.909" end="00:20:18.149" style="s2">really complicated and it&#39;s going to be a<br />lot more difficult to manipulate the actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.149" end="00:20:22.409" style="s2">thing than to manipulate some representative<br />abstraction of it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.409" end="00:20:28.110" style="s2">So if you could get an abstraction that captures<br />the gist of the entity--now how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.110" end="00:20:33.159" style="s2">is not exactly obvious--but if you can, then<br />you can expend a lot more resources concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.159" end="00:20:39.149" style="s2">on the relevant parts of the entity and a<br />lot less time concentrating on the irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.149" end="00:20:40.149" style="s2">parts.</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.149" end="00:20:46.929" style="s2">So for example if you ask a child to draw<br />a house, what colour the house is is irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.929" end="00:20:49.369" style="s2">Now why it&#39;s irrelevant is not exactly obvious.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.369" end="00:20:52.570" style="s2">I guess it&#39;s because colour can vary across<br />houses.</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.570" end="00:20:57.850" style="s2">And colour varies across all sorts of other<br />things, and so colour turns out to be a non-canonical</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.850" end="00:21:01.419" style="s2">element of &quot;house&quot; and so you can just dispense<br />with it when you&#39;re thinking about a house.</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.419" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">You&#39;d say, well it doesn&#39;t matter what colour<br />the house is--it&#39;s still a house.</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:10.499" style="s2">So what exactly defines those features that<br />make something a house rather than something</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.499" end="00:21:13.220" style="s2">else are not that easy to figure out.</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.220" end="00:21:17.809" style="s2">You could say, well, a house has four walls<br />and a roof.</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.809" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">And those are the external walls and I guess<br />you could identify the minimal necessary components,</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:25.489" style="s2">but even that&#39;s not so simple.</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.489" end="00:21:30.220" style="s2">And you could say a house is also something<br />that someone lives in, which allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.220" end="00:21:36.039" style="s2">put caves as houses because caves obviously<br />share very little in common with the standard</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.039" end="00:21:37.960" style="s2">house.</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.960" end="00:21:42.239" style="s2">My point is that it&#39;s difficult exactly to<br />figure out what set of features we do use</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.239" end="00:21:46.929" style="s2">to determine whether something is a member<br />of a class.</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.929" end="00:21:52.450" style="s2">There&#39;s this guy named Gigerenzer who’s<br />thought about this a lot, and he thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.450" end="00:21:55.389" style="s2">they&#39;re a combination of objective and functional,<br />basically.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.389" end="00:22:00.169" style="s2">And that enables us to do things like come<br />up with a category of &quot;things you would take</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.169" end="00:22:03.260" style="s2">from your apartment if it was on fire&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.260" end="00:22:07.779" style="s2">Which is a really interesting category because<br />most of the things that you&#39;re going to take</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.779" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">bear very little resemblance--it&#39;s hard to<br />see why they make a category.</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:21.509" style="s2">Pets, family members--probably in that order--photo<br />albums, identification, what else might you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.509" end="00:22:22.509" style="s2">take?</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.509" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">Your phone, I suppose.</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:28.460" style="s2">What else would you take out of an apartment<br />during a fire?</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.460" end="00:22:32.940" style="s2">Well you guys would be out on the street stark<br />naked obviously.</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.940" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">Well you get the point is that those things<br />that I just mentioned seem to share very little</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:42.029" style="s2">in terms of objective features in common,<br />but there&#39;s some reason that they still cohere</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.029" end="00:22:43.029" style="s2">as a category.</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.029" end="00:22:45.489" style="s2">Alright, so why do you need to abstract?</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.489" end="00:22:48.620" style="s2">Well, because you can handle the complexity<br />of the world better.</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.620" end="00:22:53.590" style="s2">Even your perception is a form of abstraction,<br />you know, because when you look at someone,</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.590" end="00:22:57.899" style="s2">a lot of the abstraction is done for you because<br />you just can&#39;t perceive very well, but when</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.899" end="00:23:02.139" style="s2">you look at someone--first of all, you only<br />see the surface of them that&#39;s facing you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.139" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">and not the other surface, so that&#39;s a big<br />limitation.</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:10.220" style="s2">You only see them now in this split second,<br />rather than extended across time.</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.220" end="00:23:18.730" style="s2">You don&#39;t see any of their microstructure<br />beyond the general pattern of the physiology</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.730" end="00:23:20.220" style="s2">at this level of resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.220" end="00:23:21.269" style="s2">You don&#39;t see anything beyond that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.269" end="00:23:25.659" style="s2">I can&#39;t see your cells or your organs or anything<br />like that, which is actually a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.659" end="00:23:26.879" style="s2">often for us.</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.879" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">And I can&#39;t see the systems that you&#39;re part<br />of.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:35.029" style="s2">So right off the bat, just to perceive gives<br />you a low resolution representation, and a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.029" end="00:23:37.330" style="s2">lot of that is limitations of your processing.</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.330" end="00:23:39.269" style="s2">Your eyes just can&#39;t zoom in that far.</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.269" end="00:23:42.029" style="s2">You don&#39;t have the cortical capacity to improve<br />your vision.</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.029" end="00:23:45.080" style="s2">Plus, how much do you really want to see at<br />one time?</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.080" end="00:23:47.809" style="s2">No more than necessary, whatever that means.</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.809" end="00:23:50.419" style="s2">And evolution seems to take care of that problem.</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.419" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">So your perception abstracts for you right<br />away, but then I would say maybe you make</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:59.049" style="s2">a leap from perception to conception, something<br />like that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.049" end="00:24:04.029" style="s2">And so that would be the leap from the perception<br />of the actual object to the image of the object,</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.029" end="00:24:07.629" style="s2">and then a leap from the image of the object<br />to the word.</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.629" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">So it looks to me that a word is a representation<br />of an image which is a representation of an</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:18.169" style="s2">object or a situation--it&#39;s something like<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.169" end="00:24:21.129" style="s2">And you need those because you have to deal<br />with a complex world.</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.129" end="00:24:23.529" style="s2">So here&#39;s one way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.529" end="00:24:25.970" style="s2">Look at the top left corner of that diagram.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.970" end="00:24:33.159" style="s2">I call that the thing in itself, and what<br />it is is an array of dots, roughly speaking,</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.159" end="00:24:38.659" style="s2">and--I think there&#39;s 350 dots there--and you<br />might say, well--and then if it was a real</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.659" end="00:24:43.389" style="s2">world object you could imagine that would<br />be in three dimensions, not two, because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.389" end="00:24:48.700" style="s2">two, and it would be transformed because it<br />would be also extended across time.</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.700" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">And it would have microstructures that were<br />far smaller than that and macrostructures</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:25:00.879" style="s2">that were far bigger, so even that is an abstraction,<br />but I&#39;m using a fairly complex abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.879" end="00:25:02.769" style="s2">to represent the thing in itself.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.769" end="00:25:05.570" style="s2">That&#39;s the thing you cannot perceive, right.</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.570" end="00:25:06.739" style="s2">What something actually is.</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.739" end="00:25:07.979" style="s2">You just get an image.</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.979" end="00:25:11.929" style="s2">And then the next five things are ways you<br />could look at that.</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.929" end="00:25:13.599" style="s2">So you could say, well, it&#39;s a rectangle.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.599" end="00:25:17.399" style="s2">You could say it&#39;s four rectangles, and forget<br />about the dots.</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.399" end="00:25:23.289" style="s2">You could say that it&#39;s--I think that&#39;s 16<br />lines or, what is it, 32 lines?</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.289" end="00:25:25.259" style="s2">24 lines.</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.259" end="00:25:31.369" style="s2">So if that thing in itself was an orchard<br />and you were going to walk south to north</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.369" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">through it, that would be a good representation.</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:39.759" style="s2">Those would be corridors, roughly speaking,<br />and then object four is a combination of object</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.759" end="00:25:41.019" style="s2">one and object two.</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.019" end="00:25:47.210" style="s2">And then object five is, well, all that&#39;s<br />blurred out are the little groups of six dots.</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.210" end="00:25:50.340" style="s2">And so you might say, well, what is that thing?</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.340" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">And then the answer is, well it&#39;s any of those<br />five things.</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:56.669" style="s2">And so that&#39;s an interesting way of thinking<br />about it too because one of the things it</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.669" end="00:26:01.470" style="s2">shows you is that you can disagree about what<br />something is right at the level of perception.</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.470" end="00:26:05.110" style="s2">And then you might say well which of those<br />is the best representation?</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.110" end="00:26:10.950" style="s2">And the first answer might be, well, the most<br />complex one: the one in the left-hand corner.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.950" end="00:26:15.369" style="s2">But that&#39;s not necessarily the case--it might<br />depend on what you want the representation</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.369" end="00:26:16.369" style="s2">for.</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.369" end="00:26:21.299" style="s2">Like imagine--it&#39;s weird, it&#39;s weird--because<br />imagine you have a map, okay.</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.299" end="00:26:25.389" style="s2">And so you think, well I&#39;m going to make the<br />best map in the world, and so you make a map</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.389" end="00:26:31.149" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the same size as the territory<br />that it represents and has all the detail.</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.149" end="00:26:37.159" style="s2">Well that&#39;s not any use at all, that thing,<br />because you could just use the territory,</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.159" end="00:26:38.369" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.369" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">Just because, as a map gets increasingly detailed,<br />to some degree, it&#39;s increasingly useless</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:46.940" style="s2">as a map.</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.940" end="00:26:51.869" style="s2">And so what you need is this weird combination<br />between accuracy and simplicity.</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.869" end="00:26:56.820" style="s2">And so you want your map to be no more complicated<br />than is necessary than to take you from point</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.820" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">A to point B, that&#39;s it.</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:04.309" style="s2">Because otherwise, it wouldn&#39;t be simple to<br />use and the additional complexity would limit</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.309" end="00:27:09.139" style="s2">the utility of the map.</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.139" end="00:27:12.690" style="s2">So you might say that what we&#39;re trying to<br />do with our intelligence is to get what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.690" end="00:27:17.340" style="s2">need with the least amount of effort possible.</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.340" end="00:27:26.109" style="s2">And there&#39;s a sort of Piagetian idea that&#39;s<br />lurking behind that, which is: you have limited</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.109" end="00:27:31.509" style="s2">resources, you don&#39;t want to expend more energy<br />than is necessary, and you want to build representations</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.509" end="00:27:37.529" style="s2">of the world that suffice to keep you going<br />now and then next week and next month, and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.529" end="00:27:39.950" style="s2">then along and then in groups.</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.950" end="00:27:45.019" style="s2">And so you build a representation of the world<br />that has some concordance of the thing in</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.019" end="00:27:49.590" style="s2">itself, but has this functional simplicity<br />so that you can actually use it in the real</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.590" end="00:27:50.590" style="s2">world.</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.590" end="00:27:53.649" style="s2">Alright, so back to this diagram.</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.649" end="00:27:58.859" style="s2">So I&#39;ve got the object and five representations,<br />and then there are ways of representing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.859" end="00:28:03.989" style="s2">linguistically at the bottom.</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.989" end="00:28:08.620" style="s2">What that is--the words are basically a simplification<br />of something that&#39;s already simplified.</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.620" end="00:28:18.519" style="s2">So intelligence seems to have something to<br />do with the process of functional simplification.</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.519" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">Now, back to the library of questions.</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.919" style="s2">So you have this database of questions and<br />so then what is you is pull out a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.919" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">questions, randomly.</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:36.259" style="s2">Alright, and you want to pick out a hundred<br />because if you just pick out one--like if</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.259" end="00:28:39.889" style="s2">I asked you what the capital of Georgia was<br />and I asked you what the capital of Georgia</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.889" end="00:28:45.009" style="s2">was, and you got it wrong and you got it right,<br />I couldn&#39;t really say with any degree of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.009" end="00:28:48.019" style="s2">that that means that you have more intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.019" end="00:28:53.190" style="s2">Because the probability that I&#39;d get an accurate<br />measure with one question is quite low, but</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.190" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">if I used three questions, well then, I would<br />start to become--my measurement would start</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:05.460" style="s2">to become less error-ridden, and if I used<br />10 it would even be better, and if I used</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.460" end="00:29:06.760" style="s2">20...</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.760" end="00:29:11.649" style="s2">For a personality questionnaire, the rule<br />of thumb--and this is just a rule of thumb--is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.649" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">that, if you don&#39;t have 20 questions in the<br />questionnaire then you don&#39;t have enough questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:20.330" style="s2">to really generate a reliable measure.</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.330" end="00:29:28.289" style="s2">So you&#39;ll still see single item measures used<br />in psychology, but you can add additional</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.289" end="00:29:32.279" style="s2">accuracy by increasing the number of items.</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.279" end="00:29:38.719" style="s2">I designed an IQ test a while back and we<br />got a pretty good reliability and pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.719" end="00:29:40.210" style="s2">validity.</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.210" end="00:29:44.479" style="s2">Reliability is, you know, you test the same<br />set of people twice and the rank order of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.479" end="00:29:46.109" style="s2">their performance stays the same.</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.109" end="00:29:51.229" style="s2">So if you got 90 on the previous on the previous<br />test you&#39;d get 90, and if you got 95, because</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.229" end="00:29:55.629" style="s2">you&#39;re more intelligent in this example, if<br />you got 95 on the last one you&#39;d get 95 on</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.629" end="00:29:56.629" style="s2">this one.</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.629" end="00:29:57.809" style="s2">So that&#39;s reliability.</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.809" end="00:30:03.399" style="s2">We could get a pretty reliable IQ test with<br />nine items, but it was substantially improved</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.399" end="00:30:04.970" style="s2">with 17.</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.970" end="00:30:10.129" style="s2">And with increments you get a, what would<br />you call it, diminishing returns.</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.129" end="00:30:11.850" style="s2">So a hundred is plenty.</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.850" end="00:30:17.970" style="s2">Okay, so you pull out a hundred questions<br />and then you take 100 people and you gave</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.970" end="00:30:22.899" style="s2">them those questions, and then you score them--right<br />and wrong, that&#39;s all there is--and then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.899" end="00:30:24.230" style="s2">sum the scores.</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.230" end="00:30:30.059" style="s2">Okay, so basically, the sum behaves like the<br />average--let&#39;s say you average the scores</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.059" end="00:30:33.789" style="s2">just to make the argument a little bit more<br />straightforward.</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.789" end="00:30:42.139" style="s2">You average the scores, and so each of you<br />gets the average calculated across the times</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.139" end="00:30:47.609" style="s2">that you were right and wrong, so it&#39;s an<br />approximation of the frequency of how right</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.609" end="00:30:53.240" style="s2">you were, and then we rank order you: 1 to<br />100.</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.240" end="00:30:54.759" style="s2">That&#39;s IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.759" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">That&#39;s all there is to it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:00.149" style="s2">Now people say IQ doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.149" end="00:31:05.789" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s annoying, because all they&#39;re<br />doing is gerrymandering the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.789" end="00:31:07.409" style="s2">the word exist.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.409" end="00:31:13.309" style="s2">You know, because you can do that: if you<br />ask if A is equivalent to B, the answer is,</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.309" end="00:31:17.869" style="s2">it depends on what you mean by A and what<br />you mean by B. It&#39;s almost always a foolish</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.869" end="00:31:22.820" style="s2">question because you can take B and A and<br />bend them and twist them in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.820" end="00:31:25.879" style="s2">you can make one thing another thing without<br />too much problem.</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.879" end="00:31:31.659" style="s2">People usually get around that by only using<br />a word in a context, right--in a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.659" end="00:31:36.360" style="s2">or a phrase or a paragraph that defines the<br />word so that you can&#39;t weasel around like</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.360" end="00:31:37.559" style="s2">that.</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.559" end="00:31:45.349" style="s2">But more specifically in psychology, we have<br />methods to tell if something is real, and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.349" end="00:31:53.389" style="s2">if IQ doesn&#39;t pass the test of reality for<br />a psychological measure, then no other psychological</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.389" end="00:31:58.759" style="s2">measures pass the test because they&#39;re validated<br />exactly the same way IQ is, and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.759" end="00:32:00.450" style="s2">work as well.</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.450" end="00:32:05.799" style="s2">So you can say, well no, that&#39;s not real,<br />but then you have to throw out--you probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.799" end="00:32:10.889" style="s2">have to throw out the social sciences completely<br />insofar as they&#39;re actually sciences.</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.889" end="00:32:13.929" style="s2">Because the same statistics are used to generate<br />their findings.</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.929" end="00:32:17.479" style="s2">So you can&#39;t just say, well this really powerful<br />thing doesn&#39;t exist while a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.479" end="00:32:19.969" style="s2">weak things exist and they&#39;re measured the<br />same way.</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.969" end="00:32:21.929" style="s2">You don&#39;t get to play that game.</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.929" end="00:32:25.469" style="s2">Okay, so does it exist?</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.469" end="00:32:28.929" style="s2">Well you can measure it reliably, so that&#39;s<br />definitely something.</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.929" end="00:32:32.249" style="s2">You know, because you might say, well does<br />your shadow exist?</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.249" end="00:32:37.649" style="s2">Well, generally speaking under normal conditions<br />you could measure your shadow relatively reliably.</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.649" end="00:32:39.759" style="s2">Does it exist?</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.759" end="00:32:45.109" style="s2">Well, it passes one test of existence.</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.109" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">You can&#39;t detect it with a number of senses--you<br />can&#39;t touch it--for example, but whether or</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:55.639" style="s2">not something exists is actually a rather<br />tricky question.</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.639" end="00:33:05.479" style="s2">But <br />you can measure it and it&#39;s useful, and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.479" end="00:33:08.489" style="s2">not a bad definition of &quot;exist&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.489" end="00:33:13.539" style="s2">So, what&#39;s it good for?</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.539" end="00:33:18.580" style="s2">Well, it predicts major life outcomes, and<br />importantly.</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.580" end="00:33:26.369" style="s2">And we can talk about the power of intelligence<br />momentarily.</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.369" end="00:33:31.159" style="s2">If you were actually going to calculate an<br />IQ score per se, you would take the rank order</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.159" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">that I just described and you would correct<br />if for age, because you can&#39;t really expect</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:42.740" style="s2">a 7 year old to know as much as a 15 year<br />old or a 20 year old, so generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.740" end="00:33:47.409" style="s2">if you take a technical IQ test, it will rank<br />order you but it will only rank order you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.409" end="00:33:50.179" style="s2">with people the same age as you.</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.179" end="00:33:53.590" style="s2">So that&#39;s just another, you know, it&#39;s an<br />additional correction, whether or not that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.590" end="00:34:01.080" style="s2">actually gives you a more accurate estimate<br />of IQ depends on what you mean by accurate.</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.080" end="00:34:08.610" style="s2">A very bright 7 year old generally doesn&#39;t<br />know enough to do much useful in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.610" end="00:34:18.030" style="s2">work, but they can learn extremely quickly,<br />and so if you compare 7 year olds to people</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.030" end="00:34:22.919" style="s2">of other ages purely in terms of their score<br />on an IQ test, there&#39;s a high probability</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.919" end="00:34:26.930" style="s2">that you would underestimate their speed of<br />learning.</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.930" end="00:34:32.020" style="s2">By the same token though, by the time you&#39;re<br />40 you have a lot of accumulated knowledge,</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.020" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">and so if you only measured learning speed<br />then you would overestimate the 7 year old&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:44.880" style="s2">advantage over the 40 year old.</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.880" end="00:34:54.290" style="s2">IQ is basically a unitary phenomena, but you<br />can fractionate it into...it&#39;s very very complicated,</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.290" end="00:34:57.750" style="s2">for reasons that I&#39;ll tell you about in a<br />minute.</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.750" end="00:35:02.750" style="s2">If you had to divide IQ into two, the way<br />you would divide it would be into crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.750" end="00:35:04.700" style="s2">and fluid intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.700" end="00:35:09.670" style="s2">And fluid intelligence would be, roughly,<br />the ability to learn.</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.670" end="00:35:14.700" style="s2">And crystallized intelligence would be, roughly,<br />a measure of how much you&#39;ve learned.</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.700" end="00:35:21.581" style="s2">Now those are separate to some degree, and<br />here&#39;s why they&#39;re separate: as you age, your</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.581" end="00:35:24.500" style="s2">capacity to learn decreases.</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.500" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">It&#39;s quite ugly.</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:31.570" style="s2">So by the time you&#39;re about 24, you&#39;re starting<br />to get stupider, from the perspective of being</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.570" end="00:35:32.600" style="s2">able to learn.</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.600" end="00:35:37.350" style="s2">And that&#39;s just pretty much a linear trip<br />downhill until you depart the world.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.350" end="00:35:42.030" style="s2">So it&#39;s nasty to see because it&#39;s quite a<br />steep generation.</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.030" end="00:35:49.180" style="s2">You can stave that off, by the way, with cardiovascular<br />exercise and weightlifting--so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.180" end="00:35:52.140" style="s2">best way to keep your learning capacity intact.</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.140" end="00:35:55.900" style="s2">It&#39;s not to do cognitive exercises, it&#39;s to<br />do physical exercises.</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.900" end="00:36:02.430" style="s2">And then as you age, the amount you know goes<br />up and what happens is those two things actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.430" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">tend to average out.</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:10.130" style="s2">Now you might say, well if I&#39;m claiming that<br />IQ is a unitary thing, how can I make the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.130" end="00:36:15.180" style="s2">claim that you can divide it into two elements<br />and that those elements are in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.180" end="00:36:16.180" style="s2">separate.</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.180" end="00:36:22.830" style="s2">And I think the reason is for this: your prefrontal<br />cortex, roughly speaking--so that&#39;s the part</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.830" end="00:36:27.910" style="s2">of your brain here forward--you can think<br />about in part, it&#39;s the part that does the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.910" end="00:36:33.500" style="s2">programming of motor activity--voluntary motor<br />activity--but it also seems to be...so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.500" end="00:36:38.380" style="s2">say you&#39;re doing something new and you&#39;re<br />pretty clunky and awkward at it, and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.380" end="00:36:42.670" style="s2">you do it more and more and you get smoother<br />and smoother and smoother at it, and you automatize</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.670" end="00:36:43.670" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.670" end="00:36:48.250" style="s2">What happens is you&#39;re using your prefrontal<br />cortex and, to some degree, your whole right</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.250" end="00:36:53.190" style="s2">hemisphere as you&#39;re first doing it, and then<br />as you get better and better at it the ability</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.190" end="00:36:57.020" style="s2">shifts to the left and then goes backwards.</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.020" end="00:37:01.660" style="s2">So what&#39;s happening, to some degree, is your<br />prefrontal cortex is programming the rest</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.660" end="00:37:03.170" style="s2">of your brain.</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.170" end="00:37:10.070" style="s2">And you can think of fluid intelligence as<br />a measure of the ability of your brain to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.070" end="00:37:16.750" style="s2">program itself, and crystallized ability as<br />a measure of how much programming is there.</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.750" end="00:37:20.200" style="s2">So they&#39;re separate in that manner because<br />they perform separate functions, but then</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.200" end="00:37:25.380" style="s2">you can also understand that the better your<br />programmer is, the better your programming</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.380" end="00:37:28.660" style="s2">is going to be so that inflates the correlation.</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.660" end="00:37:34.790" style="s2">And so you can have to separate things functionally--that<br />are even dissociable in terms of age--but</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.790" end="00:37:40.470" style="s2">because they work so tightly together--it&#39;s<br />like, how fast can you dig a hole and how</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.470" end="00:37:42.330" style="s2">big is the pile of dirt?</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.330" end="00:37:46.110" style="s2">Well obviously those two things are different<br />in some important sense, but they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.110" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">to be highly correlated because the faster<br />you can dig a hole, the bigger the pile of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:50.520" style="s2">dirt.</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.520" end="00:37:57.640" style="s2">So anyways, crystallized intelligence is also<br />often measured as verbal intelligence, but</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.640" end="00:38:03.090" style="s2">the better measure fundamentally is crystallized<br />intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.090" end="00:38:11.880" style="s2">Now, you know how we looked at the personality<br />hierarchy, right--that was this *gestures</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.880" end="00:38:14.030" style="s2">to slide*.</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.030" end="00:38:21.510" style="s2">And what you see is three strata, roughly<br />speaking: aspect, trait, superfactor.</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.510" end="00:38:27.870" style="s2">And it looks like--the superfactors, I would<br />say, the validity of those superfactors is</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.870" end="00:38:30.010" style="s2">not yet clear.</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.010" end="00:38:34.530" style="s2">You can get a lot of useful prediction by<br />looking at the traits, and there&#39;s more and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.530" end="00:38:39.821" style="s2">more evidence--there&#39;s about 400 studies now<br />using the aspects--there&#39;s more and more evidence</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.821" end="00:38:46.940" style="s2">that you can also derive additional useful<br />predictive validity from differentiating the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.940" end="00:38:50.860" style="s2">personality down to the aspect level.</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.860" end="00:38:55.150" style="s2">So that&#39;s the highest resolution personality<br />level we have.</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.150" end="00:39:00.300" style="s2">There are people who claim that there&#39;s something<br />at the apex which you might call &quot;good personality&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.300" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:04.790" style="s2">I think it&#39;s--I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.790" end="00:39:10.690" style="s2">You&#39;d have to read the literature to understand<br />the dispute--it&#39;s a statistical dispute roughly</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.690" end="00:39:16.540" style="s2">speaking--but we&#39;ve found in our research<br />that stability and plasticity are only correlated</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.540" end="00:39:17.540" style="s2">at 0.2.</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.540" end="00:39:18.770" style="s2">They&#39;re pretty separate.</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.770" end="00:39:27.790" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to stick with that for now even<br />though it might be wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.790" end="00:40:06.360" style="s2">Okay, so </p>
<p begin="00:40:06.360" end="00:40:12.770" style="s2">if you read the cognitive literature and the<br />neuropsychological literature, you will find</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.770" end="00:40:20.260" style="s2">that neuropsychologists tend to assume that<br />there are forms of cognitive ability that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.260" end="00:40:24.140" style="s2">you cannot describe as IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.140" end="00:40:29.950" style="s2">And they make that claim because they&#39;ll take<br />a test and they&#39;ll use the test to measure</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.950" end="00:40:34.130" style="s2">something, and then they&#39;ll correlate that<br />with IQ and the correlation will only be about</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.130" end="00:40:35.700" style="s2">0.2 or 0.3.</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.700" end="00:40:41.500" style="s2">And they&#39;ll say, well that&#39;s not a high enough<br />correlation to justify saying that those things</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.500" end="00:40:46.150" style="s2">are identical--because the correlation should<br />be more like 0.8 for them to be identical.</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.150" end="00:40:52.190" style="s2">But the problem is, let&#39;s say I had a measure<br />if your IQ and your IQ and your IQ and your</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.190" end="00:40:57.790" style="s2">IQ, and then I asked you two questions, and<br />you and you and you, and I summed your answers,</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.790" end="00:41:00.370" style="s2">whether they correct or incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.370" end="00:41:05.150" style="s2">Now what would happen is, there&#39;d be some<br />correlation between your total score on those</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.150" end="00:41:08.080" style="s2">two questions and your overall IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.080" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">Maybe it would be 0.3.</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:15.790" style="s2">But that wouldn&#39;t justify me in claiming that<br />the two question IQ test is different from</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.790" end="00:41:20.060" style="s2">the full scale IQ test--it&#39;s just worse.</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.060" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">And you&#39;re going to run into this problem<br />when you read psychological literature and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:29.390" style="s2">if you ever do any research because it&#39;s very<br />difficult to determine whether you get what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.390" end="00:41:34.010" style="s2">called &quot;discriminant validity&quot; which is, this<br />thing measures this thing, and this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.010" end="00:41:37.170" style="s2">measures this thing, and they&#39;re actually<br />different.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.170" end="00:41:41.480" style="s2">Or whether you just have a lousy measure of<br />this and a lousy measure of this and so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.480" end="00:41:42.900" style="s2">correlation is low.</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.900" end="00:41:51.140" style="s2">Now here&#39;s a neuropsychological test, and<br />you can make the case that this is measuring</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.140" end="00:41:53.940" style="s2">something different than IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.940" end="00:42:01.820" style="s2">So imagine that you see an array of 12 pictures--they&#39;re<br />just drawings, drawings of a telephone and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.820" end="00:42:04.790" style="s2">a booth and a chair--just common objects.</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.790" end="00:42:06.540" style="s2">So you see 12 of them.</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.540" end="00:42:11.570" style="s2">And then you have to click one, and then when<br />you do that, they move.</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.570" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">And then the next time you have to click one<br />you haven&#39;t already clicked.</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:18.510" style="s2">And then they move again and you click, and<br />then they move again and you click.</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.510" end="00:42:22.760" style="s2">And you see by about the time that you get<br />to about 8 of them, you&#39;re starting to run</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.760" end="00:42:28.200" style="s2">into trouble because it&#39;s difficult to remember<br />more than 8 abstractions simultaneously--7</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.200" end="00:42:34.110" style="s2">actually, and some people claim it&#39;s as low<br />as 4--that&#39;s the capacity of working memory.</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.110" end="00:42:37.010" style="s2">Which is why we kind of like phone numbers<br />to be 7 digits long.</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.010" end="00:42:43.140" style="s2">A lot of the things we want to just remember<br />are 7 units long, and if we want to remember</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.140" end="00:42:45.470" style="s2">more than that, we chunk.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.470" end="00:42:52.900" style="s2">Although if I show you some dots *draws dots*<br />how many dots?</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.900" end="00:42:53.900" style="s2">3.</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.900" end="00:42:54.940" style="s2">You don&#39;t have to count them.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.940" end="00:43:03.130" style="s2">You can see 3 dots. *draws more dots* You<br />can see 4 dots.</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.130" end="00:43:06.020" style="s2">It&#39;s not obvious that you can see 5 dots.</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.020" end="00:43:09.260" style="s2">At that point you start to go &quot;3 and 2&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.260" end="00:43:15.660" style="s2">And then if there&#39;s 6 dots, well that&#39;s how<br />they would be arranged on a dice, right.</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.660" end="00:43:19.080" style="s2">The reason they&#39;d be arranged on a dice that<br />way is because you can see two sets of three</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.080" end="00:43:20.520" style="s2">and infer 6.</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.520" end="00:43:26.450" style="s2">You know, if they&#39;re sort of randomly dispersed<br />like that, and I say well how many dots is</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.450" end="00:43:29.510" style="s2">that, well you have to count them.</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.510" end="00:43:34.120" style="s2">And what that shows you is that your working<br />memory--which is really a function of fluid</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.120" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">intelligence--is a very very narrow thing.</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">And it&#39;s like your vision.</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:41.900" style="s2">You know, remember we saw the gorilla video,<br />right, and you can only pick up the thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.900" end="00:43:43.430" style="s2">that you&#39;re attending to.</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.430" end="00:43:48.570" style="s2">Well working memory is like that, it&#39;s this<br />narrow narrow form of attention and it sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.570" end="00:43:53.660" style="s2">of specifies unitary phenomena--I mean that&#39;s<br />not quite unitary but it&#39;s close enough.</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.660" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">And I think the reason it does that--it&#39;s<br />like, why&#39;s your attention so narrow--is because</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:03.580" style="s2">often what you&#39;re trying to do as you work<br />in the world is to make binary choices.</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.580" end="00:44:07.790" style="s2">You know, you don&#39;t want to choose between<br />20 things, you want to choose between two</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.790" end="00:44:11.660" style="s2">things, because then when you choose between<br />two things you can actually act.</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.660" end="00:44:15.380" style="s2">If it&#39;s still two things you can&#39;t act, if<br />it&#39;s one thing you can act.</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.380" end="00:44:19.890" style="s2">So imagine you go into a Chinese restaurant<br />is a good example, because Chinese restaurants</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.890" end="00:44:24.720" style="s2">virtually always have like 400 items on the<br />menu. and you might ask yourself, well how</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.720" end="00:44:27.610" style="s2">the hell do you figure out what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.610" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">And what you don&#39;t do is go through every<br />single menu item and contemplate it because</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:33.640" style="s2">then you&#39;d be there for a week.</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.640" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">So what you seem to do is eradicate chunks.</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:42.620" style="s2">So you might say, well I&#39;m not in the mood<br />for anything but fish.</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.620" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">Okay, bang, three-quarters of the menu disappears.</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:47.850" style="s2">You know, and then you might go, well I don&#39;t<br />want it breaded.</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.850" end="00:44:52.250" style="s2">Whack, and then another half is gone and now<br />you&#39;re down to maybe 8 choices.</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.250" end="00:44:55.742" style="s2">And, you know, you reduce that to 4 and then<br />to 2 perhaps.</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.742" end="00:44:57.460" style="s2">Well I&#39;d like this or I&#39;d like that.</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.460" end="00:44:59.620" style="s2">But the waiter doesn&#39;t care about that.</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.620" end="00:45:03.800" style="s2">The waiter wants to know which one you want,<br />because until it&#39;s reduced to one you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.800" end="00:45:05.260" style="s2">get to act.</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.260" end="00:45:11.990" style="s2">And so the reduction, the reduced narrow strip<br />that we use to perceive the world in partly</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.990" end="00:45:14.250" style="s2">is a consequence of processing inadequacy.</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.250" end="00:45:19.010" style="s2">But it&#39;s also partly because we really are<br />trying to reduce things all the time to 0</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.010" end="00:45:21.810" style="s2">and 1, yes and no.</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.810" end="00:45:26.590" style="s2">Okay, so back to the three stratum theory<br />of cognitive abilities.</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.590" end="00:45:33.250" style="s2">Now, you&#39;ve got this array of 12 items and<br />it keeps shifting.</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.250" end="00:45:39.640" style="s2">And what I would do is score you by the number<br />of duplications--if you pick the same item</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.640" end="00:45:41.090" style="s2">more than once, you lose a point.</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.090" end="00:45:45.950" style="s2">So the maximum points you can get is 12 and,<br />you know, people usually make 3 or 4 mistakes.</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.950" end="00:45:50.750" style="s2">And so I can take your score on that test--maybe<br />I&#39;d give it to you 2 or 3 times just to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.750" end="00:45:55.370" style="s2">sure I have a reasonably stable indicator--and<br />then I could correlate it with your full-scale</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.370" end="00:45:56.370" style="s2">fluid IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.370" end="00:45:59.910" style="s2">And I&#39;d get a correlation of about 0.25 or<br />0.3.</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.910" end="00:46:04.870" style="s2">Now, if you don&#39;t know anything about psychometrics<br />you&#39;d say, well that&#39;s obviously measuring</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.870" end="00:46:10.100" style="s2">something different than full scale IQ because<br />it only correlates at 0.25 or 0.3.</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.100" end="00:46:14.120" style="s2">But what it turns out is, no: it&#39;s more analogous<br />to the problem that we were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.120" end="00:46:18.930" style="s2">where I asked you three questions and tried<br />to derive your entire IQ from that.</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.930" end="00:46:21.210" style="s2">It&#39;s just a bad measurement.</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.210" end="00:46:26.980" style="s2">Now what happens is if you take the neuropsychological<br />tests that people have developed, that theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.980" end="00:46:33.840" style="s2">assess the different parts of the brain, and<br />you factor analyze them and you extract out</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.840" end="00:46:38.060" style="s2">a single factor, the single factor looks exactly<br />like fluid intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.060" end="00:46:45.820" style="s2">Now, is it exactly the same as fluid intelligence?</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.820" end="00:46:49.970" style="s2">The onus would be on the person who claims<br />it&#39;s not to demonstrate the difference.</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.970" end="00:46:56.360" style="s2">We did give university students a very extensive<br />battery of pre-frontal-cortical tests and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.360" end="00:47:03.020" style="s2">measured their IQ, and then we used the pre-frontal-cortical<br />test average and the IQ to predict grades.</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.020" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">And what we did find was the pre-frontal tests<br />predicted over and above the IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:17.270" style="s2">But we thought maybe, if you took the pre-frontal<br />average and IQ and you added them to predict</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.270" end="00:47:21.290" style="s2">grades, say--that&#39;s a regression analysis--they<br />both added in.</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.290" end="00:47:25.070" style="s2">So they predicted different parts of the variation.</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.070" end="00:47:29.150" style="s2">It added additional necessary information.</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.150" end="00:47:34.730" style="s2">However, if you took all the neuropsychological<br />tests and all the individual IQ tests and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.730" end="00:47:39.860" style="s2">you put them in one data set and then extracted<br />out a single factor--so that would be fluid</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.860" end="00:47:43.810" style="s2">intelligence, roughly speaking--that predicted<br />grades very well.</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.810" end="00:47:46.620" style="s2">And then what was left over didn&#39;t predict<br />at all.</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.620" end="00:47:53.600" style="s2">So what we concluded was that neuropsychological<br />tests--pre-frontal-cortical tests--test intelligence,</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.600" end="00:48:00.180" style="s2">and they test a slightly different thing than<br />fluid intelligence tests do, but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.180" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">because they&#39;re testing something different,<br />it&#39;s because fluid intelligence tests the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:10.310" style="s2">way they&#39;re currently constituted--don&#39;t sample<br />the universe of potential questions as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.310" end="00:48:12.030" style="s2">as they should.</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.030" end="00:48:16.500" style="s2">So it wasn&#39;t that we discovered something<br />different, we discovered a measurement error,</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.500" end="00:48:17.500" style="s2">roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.500" end="00:48:18.930" style="s2">That only took 5 years by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.930" end="00:48:20.560" style="s2">It took 5 years to figure that out.</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.560" end="00:48:26.940" style="s2">It was very annoying because when we started<br />I was trying to predict grades, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.940" end="00:48:31.830" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t know the IQ literature very well<br />at that point, because psychologists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.830" end="00:48:36.600" style="s2">usually teach it very much, because IQ bothers<br />the hell out of everybody.</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.600" end="00:48:43.930" style="s2">And so, and the neuropsychologists who have<br />their own field are motivated to make the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.930" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">claim that they&#39;ve discovered something new<br />and I just took that on face value.</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">But then we tried to predict--like okay if<br />I&#39;m going to predict how well you do at your</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:58.090" style="s2">job, well I want to get a good cognitive measure<br />because if it&#39;s a complex job it keeps changing</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.090" end="00:49:01.110" style="s2">and you have to learn to keep up, and if you<br />can&#39;t do that, you&#39;re not going to do very</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.110" end="00:49:02.110" style="s2">well.</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.110" end="00:49:05.710" style="s2">So that would be bad for you and it would<br />be bad for everyone around you.</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.710" end="00:49:13.420" style="s2">And so we were trying to pick up additional<br />information that would enable the accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.420" end="00:49:19.000" style="s2">of the prediction to be increased, and looked<br />at the neuropsych literature but, at most,</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.000" end="00:49:20.360" style="s2">it was an ambivalent success.</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.360" end="00:49:23.080" style="s2">(00:49:25)<br />Okay, so how does that relate to this?</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.080" end="00:49:28.500" style="s2">Well at the bottom tier, where it&#39;s the most<br />differentiated, you have single tests.</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.500" end="00:49:32.870" style="s2">And they&#39;re only correlated with each other<br />at about 0.2, maybe 0.3.</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.870" end="00:49:35.740" style="s2">So you might say, well, they&#39;re all measuring<br />different things--they&#39;re not.</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.740" end="00:49:38.300" style="s2">They&#39;re all measuring the same thing badly.</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.300" end="00:49:40.250" style="s2">And then you might clump them.</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.250" end="00:49:47.650" style="s2">So let&#39;s say I ask you--oh god--maybe I give<br />you a test that asks you--that tested your</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:51.690" style="s2">vocabulary with 6-letter words, and then I<br />gave you another test that tested your vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.690" end="00:49:55.250" style="s2">with 7-letter words, and then another one<br />that tested your vocabulary with 8-letter</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.250" end="00:49:56.250" style="s2">words.</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.250" end="00:49:57.810" style="s2">And I said, well those are all different tests.</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.810" end="00:50:02.690" style="s2">Well they would correlate quite highly--not<br />perfectly--but I could clump them together</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.690" end="00:50:05.000" style="s2">and make one sort of super test out of them.</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.000" end="00:50:11.080" style="s2">And then I could take supertest A and supertest<br />B and supertest C and look at the correlations</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.080" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">between those, and those would climb to about<br />0.5 or 0.6.</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">And then if I clumped the supertests together,<br />which would be happening by the time we got</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:25.310" style="s2">to stratum 2 there, then the correlation between<br />the tests would start to rise to about 0.7.</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.310" end="00:50:30.741" style="s2">And then if I collapsed all the supertests<br />into a single measure, then the correlation</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.741" end="00:50:35.360" style="s2">between any of those stratum 2 tests and G,<br />because that would be the highest level thing--G</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.360" end="00:50:40.710" style="s2">is general intelligence, that&#39;s roughly speaking<br />fluid intelligence--the correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.710" end="00:50:45.500" style="s2">any of the supertests and G would be about<br />0.8.</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.500" end="00:50:50.890" style="s2">So the point of all this--there&#39;s no way of<br />discussing this sort of thing without doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.890" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">it statistically and technically because they<br />are statistical and technical processes.</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:51:01.560" style="s2">So what happens is that, now let&#39;s say now<br />you have a measure of fluid intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.560" end="00:51:04.120" style="s2">Okay, you&#39;ve got this measure.</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.120" end="00:51:09.120" style="s2">And you take one of the stratum 2 sets of<br />tests and you use both to predict academic</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.120" end="00:51:10.500" style="s2">achievement.</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.500" end="00:51:14.660" style="s2">What happens is that the superfactor, G, kills<br />the rest of them.</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.660" end="00:51:19.950" style="s2">You&#39;re just not going to be able to find any<br />of the tests in the bottom strata that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.950" end="00:51:24.430" style="s2">going to add to the prediction of what the<br />general factor can give you.</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.430" end="00:51:28.090" style="s2">Now with personality, that&#39;s just not the<br />case.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.090" end="00:51:34.330" style="s2">You can&#39;t pull out a single factor that predicts<br />how personality is going to influence job</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.330" end="00:51:36.500" style="s2">performance across your life.</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.500" end="00:51:42.340" style="s2">If you add neuroticism--if you take a single<br />factor and you add neuroticism, neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.340" end="00:51:45.230" style="s2">is going to kick the single factor out.</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.230" end="00:51:47.890" style="s2">Conscientiousness is going to kick the single<br />factor out, and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.890" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">Because there isn&#39;t a single factor.</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:54.020" style="s2">It&#39;s not--the tests aren&#39;t highly correlated<br />enough to say that they&#39;re all measuring the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.020" end="00:51:55.750" style="s2">same thing to some degree.</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.750" end="00:51:57.640" style="s2">The personality traits really are different.</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.640" end="00:52:02.670" style="s2">You know, you can clump them into plasticity<br />and stability, but even there you&#39;re maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.670" end="00:52:04.100" style="s2">a lot of validity.</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.100" end="00:52:10.931" style="s2">So if I took stability and used conscientiousness<br />to predict job performance, conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.931" end="00:52:13.170" style="s2">would wipe out stability--it&#39;d be a better<br />measure.</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.170" end="00:52:18.550" style="s2">But you never get that--you virtually never<br />get that with the lower tests in the IQ strata.</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.550" end="00:52:26.370" style="s2">Okay, now *mumbling*.</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.370" end="00:52:29.450" style="s2">That&#39;s a good representation of how these<br />things are associated.</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.450" end="00:52:34.660" style="s2">So at the bottom you have the single tests<br />and then they chunk into, say, sequential</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.660" end="00:52:39.951" style="s2">reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and induction<br />on the fluid intelligence side, and general</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.951" end="00:52:43.470" style="s2">knowledge and language development on the<br />crystallized intelligence side--that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.470" end="00:52:49.850" style="s2">red--and then they&#39;re all subsumed underneath<br />fluid intelligence, which is the measure that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.850" end="00:52:51.690" style="s2">you really want to have.</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.690" end="00:52:55.910" style="s2">Okay, so what good is that?</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.910" end="00:53:02.690" style="s2">Well, it basically correlates 0.5 with major<br />life outcomes.</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.690" end="00:53:07.350" style="s2">And that&#39;s 25% of the variance, and maybe<br />you can get it a bit higher than that, but</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.350" end="00:53:12.130" style="s2">we&#39;ll just stick with 0.5 as a representation.</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.130" end="00:53:22.740" style="s2">And so, let&#39;s <br />say you take a bunch of students, 100 of them,</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.740" end="00:53:29.360" style="s2">and you want to sort them into those who will<br />pass the class with a 50% failure rate.</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.360" end="00:53:32.360" style="s2">So you just pick them randomly--you&#39;re going<br />to pass, you&#39;re going to fail, you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.360" end="00:53:33.360" style="s2">to pass, you&#39;re going to fail.</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.360" end="00:53:34.360" style="s2">So that&#39;s no knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.360" end="00:53:35.890" style="s2">I have no predictive knowledge whatsoever.</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.890" end="00:53:42.100" style="s2">So my validity--the validity of my classification<br />is basically going to be equivalent to chance:</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.100" end="00:53:43.100" style="s2">zero.</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.100" end="00:53:47.880" style="s2">Right, I&#39;m only going to have a 50% chance<br />of picking who passes and who fails.</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.880" end="00:53:55.060" style="s2">If I used IQs--if I had all your IQ scores--and<br />I did the prediction, I&#39;d get it right 75%</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.060" end="00:53:56.690" style="s2">of the time.</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.690" end="00:53:58.130" style="s2">So it&#39;s a huge difference.</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.130" end="00:54:01.780" style="s2">It cuts the failure rate in half by using<br />IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.780" end="00:54:07.490" style="s2">And IQ is a very good predictor of health,<br />it&#39;s a predictor of longevity, it&#39;s a predictor</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.490" end="00:54:11.540" style="s2">of resistance to post traumatic stress disorder,<br />it&#39;s a predictor of--obviously--occupational</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.540" end="00:54:18.730" style="s2">status, it&#39;s a prediction of educational success,<br />it&#39;s a predictor of income.</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.730" end="00:54:20.620" style="s2">It&#39;s a very powerful predictor.</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.620" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">And here&#39;s another way of conceptualizing<br />its effects.</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:31.960" style="s2">So imagine you could choose how you were going<br />to be when you were born--this is in North</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.960" end="00:54:36.060" style="s2">America because it&#39;s going to vary by society,<br />at least to some degree.</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.060" end="00:54:41.550" style="s2">You get to be born into a family that&#39;s at<br />the 95th percentile for wealth, or you get</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.550" end="00:54:45.430" style="s2">to be born at the 95th percentile for intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.430" end="00:54:48.530" style="s2">Who&#39;s better off at the age of 40?</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.530" end="00:54:54.290" style="s2">And the answer is the person who picks being<br />born with an IQ in the 95th percentile at</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.290" end="00:54:55.290" style="s2">birth.</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.290" end="00:55:02.380" style="s2">It&#39;s a more powerful predictor of long-term<br />life outcome than familial wealth.</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.380" end="00:55:04.040" style="s2">And it shows up everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.040" end="00:55:07.723" style="s2">One of the things we did recently was look<br />at disgust sensitivity--we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.723" end="00:55:12.280" style="s2">a little bit about that when we talk about<br />conscientiousness because orderly people seem</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.280" end="00:55:15.980" style="s2">to be more sensitive to disgust than disorderly<br />people.</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.980" end="00:55:18.370" style="s2">That seems to be why they’re orderly.</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.370" end="00:55:23.470" style="s2">But, the higher you are in IQ, the less disgust<br />sensitive you are.</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.470" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">Now we don&#39;t know exactly why that is.</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:32.440" style="s2">Maybe it&#39;s because, you know, maybe you could<br />make the inference that IQ is related in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.440" end="00:55:39.410" style="s2">way to the physiological integrity of the<br />cortex rather than the limbic system, which</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.410" end="00:55:43.770" style="s2">is the source of, say, emotions and motivations.</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.770" end="00:55:50.290" style="s2">And the more powerful it is, the more inhibitory<br />capacity it has over the more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.290" end="00:55:52.210" style="s2">motivations and emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.210" end="00:55:53.550" style="s2">You could make that case.</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.550" end="00:56:00.070" style="s2">The problem is that intelligent people don&#39;t<br />necessarily seem to be any less impulsive,</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.070" end="00:56:06.250" style="s2">so... and you can have a pretty vicious personality<br />disorder that&#39;s characterized by extremely</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.250" end="00:56:11.670" style="s2">disorganized behaviour and a complete inability<br />to put long term plans into operation, and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.670" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">still have a high IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:19.260" style="s2">So, one of the things we really can&#39;t figure<br />out--it&#39;s just a hell of a thing to try to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.260" end="00:56:20.690" style="s2">figure out.</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.690" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">Like the relationship between IQ and industriousness<br />is zero.</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:30.350" style="s2">And that just makes no sense to me because<br />most of the brain models are predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.350" end="00:56:36.540" style="s2">the idea that your ability to engage in long-term<br />planning is a factor that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.540" end="00:56:38.100" style="s2">intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.100" end="00:56:42.530" style="s2">But then industriousness people seem to not<br />only engage in long-term planning, they seem</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.530" end="00:56:46.410" style="s2">to do it right so that if they&#39;re more industrious<br />and they put their plans into operation, then</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.410" end="00:56:48.390" style="s2">the plans seem to actually work.</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.390" end="00:56:50.990" style="s2">But it&#39;s not correlated with IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.990" end="00:56:55.990" style="s2">So then I can&#39;t figure out, well obviously<br />the industrious person, in some way, is able</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.990" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">to regulate their own behaviour.</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:00.869" style="s2">You know, well they&#39;re not procrastinating,<br />for example.</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.869" end="00:57:06.619" style="s2">And you&#39;d think that that--the ability to<br />not procrastinate--would be a cognitive feature,</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.619" end="00:57:08.040" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t seem to be.</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.040" end="00:57:11.730" style="s2">And we have no idea what makes people industrious,<br />and we can&#39;t figure it out.</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.730" end="00:57:16.210" style="s2">So it&#39;s this incredibly potent predictor--it&#39;s<br />just about as powerful as IQ--and we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.210" end="00:57:21.800" style="s2">no idea what it is.</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.800" end="00:57:26.420" style="s2">So if you think you have a smart idea about<br />that and you want to pursue it, feel free</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.420" end="00:57:29.010" style="s2">because there&#39;s a big mystery there that no<br />one&#39;s been able to crack.</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.010" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">And we&#39;ve been at it for a long time and have<br />had almost no success.</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:39.710" style="s2">You know, we had people do things like, we&#39;d<br />give them sentences of n’s, m&#39;s and u&#39;s--sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.710" end="00:57:42.420" style="s2">of randomly distributed--and then we&#39;d have<br />them count the u&#39;s.</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.420" end="00:57:47.690" style="s2">You know, like a whole page of sentences--they’re<br />not sentences, they&#39;re just strings of letters.</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.690" end="00:57:49.420" style="s2">Count the u&#39;s--how useless!</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.420" end="00:57:52.590" style="s2">You&#39;d think that someone industrious would<br />do that better.</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.590" end="00:57:54.660" style="s2">They don&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.660" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">That&#39;s an IQ test.</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:59.860" style="s2">The people who can count the u&#39;s faster have<br />higher IQs.</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.860" end="00:58:05.350" style="s2">Almost everything that you would do where<br />it has to do with manipulations of abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.350" end="00:58:11.620" style="s2">of any sort--even something that basic--seems<br />to be fundamentally associated with IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.620" end="00:58:15.350" style="s2">People with higher IQs have slightly bigger<br />heads, if you control for body size.</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.350" end="00:58:19.260" style="s2">They have slightly bigger brains, if you control<br />for body size.</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.260" end="00:58:25.040" style="s2">The axons on their neurons are a bit thicker,<br />so the electrical messages seem to travel</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.040" end="00:58:27.670" style="s2">a little bit more efficiently.</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.670" end="00:58:30.790" style="s2">They are slightly faster in simple reflex<br />tests.</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.790" end="00:58:35.340" style="s2">So it goes right down to the level of...because<br />a simple reflex--a light goes on, you push</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.340" end="00:58:38.400" style="s2">a button--there&#39;s not many neurons mediating<br />that response.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.400" end="00:58:39.840" style="s2">You know, chains of neurons.</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.840" end="00:58:42.890" style="s2">There&#39;s only a few neurons communicating so<br />that you can do that.</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.890" end="00:58:48.640" style="s2">But even at that relatively simple processing<br />level, IQ is associated with speed.</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.640" end="00:58:50.950" style="s2">So there&#39;s a physiological component.</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.950" end="00:58:54.580" style="s2">You&#39;re less likely to develop Alzheimer&#39;s<br />disease if you have a high IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.580" end="00:58:56.740" style="s2">And maybe that&#39;s just because your brain is<br />more robust.</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.740" end="00:59:02.050" style="s2">You know, so you could sustain damage, say,<br />of up to 50% of your brain and you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.050" end="00:59:05.770" style="s2">even show it if you have a sufficiently high<br />IQ.</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.770" end="00:59:10.170" style="s2">Whereas if you&#39;re on the bottom end of the<br />IQ distribution, you&#39;re much more--you seem</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.170" end="00:59:13.770" style="s2">to be much more susceptible to physiological<br />damage.</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.770" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">Nutrition is a big predictor of IQ variation.</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:21.340" style="s2">And a lot of that&#39;s been hammered out of modern<br />societies.</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.340" end="00:59:27.980" style="s2">You know, so 150 years ago people&#39;s IQ was<br />pretty tightly associated with their nutritional</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.980" end="00:59:32.250" style="s2">status, but now there are very few people<br />in North America who don&#39;t have enough to</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.250" end="00:59:35.350" style="s2">eat, even though there&#39;s some variation in<br />quality of diet.</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.350" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">And that&#39;s flattened out a lot of the cultural<br />variability in intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.450" end="00:59:54.840" style="s2">Okay, so this guy named Hemphill did this<br />paper--an American psychologist a while back--and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.840" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">one of the things he was interested in doing--remember<br />we talked about effect sizes, right.</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:03.560" style="s2">How big is an effect in psychology or in social<br />sciences in general?</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.560" end="01:00:10.630" style="s2">And people have used rules of thumb that 0.5<br />was a moderate effect and 0.3 was a minimal</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.630" end="01:00:16.930" style="s2">effect and 0.2 was starting to diminish to<br />the point of non-utility.</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.930" end="01:00:21.480" style="s2">But what Hemphill did instead of guessing,<br />because that was just a guess, was actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.480" end="01:00:25.510" style="s2">go and look at papers that were published<br />in psychology to see what effect sizes were</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.510" end="01:00:27.000" style="s2">being reported.</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.000" end="01:00:31.390" style="s2">So it&#39;s empirical analysis of how big the<br />effects that psychologists and other social</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.390" end="01:00:34.090" style="s2">scientists report.</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.090" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">And so what he found was that the highest<br />third of paper or the third of papers that</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:50.270" style="s2">had the biggest effects reported effects from<br />0.35 to 0.78, the middle third from 0.21 to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.270" end="01:00:54.500" style="s2">0.33, and the lower third from 0.02 to 0.21.</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.500" end="01:01:05.690" style="s2">*mumbling* If you look on the left side here<br />you see an r of less than 0.15 characterizes</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.690" end="01:01:08.530" style="s2">the first quarter of published studies.</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.530" end="01:01:13.260" style="s2">An r of 0.15 to 0.35, the next quartile.</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.260" end="01:01:19.790" style="s2">So 50% of psychological studies report an<br />r of less than 0.35.</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.790" end="01:01:29.750" style="s2">90% report an r of less than 0.5, and only<br />7 to 8% report an r of 0.5 or above.</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.750" end="01:01:35.070" style="s2">So what that means is that the relationship<br />between IQ and, say, academic performance</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.070" end="01:01:43.410" style="s2">or long-term life income is higher than that<br />reported in all but about 5% of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.410" end="01:01:44.650" style="s2">studies.</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.650" end="01:01:53.510" style="s2">Okay so here&#39;s an interesting--you might say,<br />again, in order to determine that something</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.510" end="01:01:56.580" style="s2">exists, you have to be able to measure it<br />and then it has to be good for something.</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.580" end="01:02:02.390" style="s2">So it has to be grippable and it has to be<br />useable as a tool, we&#39;ll say for the sake</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.390" end="01:02:03.460" style="s2">of argument.</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.460" end="01:02:08.080" style="s2">What sort of IQ do you need for what kind<br />of job?</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.080" end="01:02:13.510" style="s2">This was derived from a company called Wonderlic,<br />and Wonderlic does employment testing.</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.510" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">Psychologists usually don&#39;t use the Wonderlic<br />test.</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:18.520" style="s2">It&#39;s a relatively short IQ test, and it&#39;s<br />a good test.</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.520" end="01:02:21.990" style="s2">I think psychologists don&#39;t use it because<br />it was developed commercially, but we tested</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.990" end="01:02:25.770" style="s2">the Wonderlic out a lot and it has excellent<br />psychometric properties.</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.770" end="01:02:27.960" style="s2">It&#39;s a very good IQ test.</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.960" end="01:02:36.290" style="s2">It probably errs a little bit in testing crystallized<br />IQ rather than fluid IQ, but we won&#39;t argue</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.290" end="01:02:37.970" style="s2">about that for the time being.</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.970" end="01:02:47.220" style="s2">Alright so, if you have an IQ from 116 to<br />130, that puts you in the 86th to 95th percentile.</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.220" end="01:02:52.270" style="s2">Right, so that means you&#39;re minimally--if<br />there were 8 people in a room, on average</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.270" end="01:02:55.540" style="s2">you&#39;d be the smartest person.</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.540" end="01:03:03.270" style="s2">I should tell you, just so you know, that<br />if you&#39;re a state college student--we&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.270" end="01:03:08.050" style="s2">the US as an example because there&#39;s more<br />differentiation between the American universities</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.050" end="01:03:15.430" style="s2">in terms of quality than there is the Canadian<br />universities--if you&#39;re in an average American</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.430" end="01:03:19.420" style="s2">post-secondary institution, your IQ is 115.</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.420" end="01:03:24.640" style="s2">And so, you think, that&#39;s not all that bright.</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.640" end="01:03:31.609" style="s2">But that&#39;s brighter than 7 out of 8 people<br />in the general population.</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.609" end="01:03:36.990" style="s2">And so the are as many people--if you look<br />at the North American distribution...so you</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.990" end="01:03:40.990" style="s2">have the 50th percentile in the middle of<br />the normal distribution, you have the 85th</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.990" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">percentile here, and you have the 15th percentile<br />here.</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:49.460" style="s2">So about 70% of people fall between the 15th<br />and the 85th percentile.</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.460" end="01:03:53.720" style="s2">At the 15th percentile you&#39;re not really very<br />literate.</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.720" end="01:03:57.869" style="s2">And so what that means is that in the United<br />States there&#39;s just as many people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.869" end="01:04:01.470" style="s2">literate as there are people who are in college.</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.470" end="01:04:08.410" style="s2">And what I would mean by literate is not so<br />much--like here&#39;s a bare bones definition</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.410" end="01:04:12.750" style="s2">of literate: you can follow written instructions.</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.750" end="01:04:16.020" style="s2">And so what that means is it&#39;s kind of a two-fold<br />issue, right.</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.020" end="01:04:21.490" style="s2">You can make out the words and the phrases<br />and the sentences, but then you can translate</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.490" end="01:04:25.010" style="s2">them into actual action--you can use them<br />as information.</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.010" end="01:04:28.440" style="s2">And at 85 you&#39;re going to have not a very<br />good time doing that.</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.440" end="01:04:36.840" style="s2">And so, when you&#39;re wondering things about<br />the way society is structured and why people</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.840" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily make the most intellectually<br />sophisticated choices, one thing that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:45.770" style="s2">much worth remembering is that there&#39;s just<br />as many people who are functionally illiterate</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.770" end="01:04:51.150" style="s2">in north America as there are people who are<br />in tier-one colleges.</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.150" end="01:04:52.150" style="s2">It&#39;s quite shocking.</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.150" end="01:04:57.010" style="s2">Anyways, okay so you want to be an attorney,<br />a research analyst, an editor, an advertising</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.010" end="01:05:02.660" style="s2">manager, a chemist, an engineer, an executive,<br />a systems analyst, an auditor--so you&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.660" end="01:05:05.480" style="s2">in the professional levels there.</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.480" end="01:05:09.100" style="s2">You need an IQ of at least 116.</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.100" end="01:05:11.240" style="s2">And so 130 would be better.</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.240" end="01:05:16.990" style="s2">My suspicions are that the average IQ of people<br />in this room is about 120 to 125.</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.990" end="01:05:19.550" style="s2">It might be a little higher than that.</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.550" end="01:05:23.630" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to measure IQ in the U of T population<br />because a lot of people have English as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.630" end="01:05:29.260" style="s2">second language and so that makes it harder<br />to measure crystallized intelligence obviously</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.260" end="01:05:31.570" style="s2">using an English language test.</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.570" end="01:05:38.030" style="s2">But we&#39;ve found, when we&#39;ve done our studies<br />at the U of T, that the average exceeds 120.</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.030" end="01:05:43.850" style="s2">So, you know, so you guys have the cognitive<br />power to basically pursue professional level</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.850" end="01:05:47.130" style="s2">careers.</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.130" end="01:05:55.840" style="s2">From 110 to 115: manager, supervisor, programmer,<br />teacher, general manager, purchasing agent,</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.840" end="01:05:58.340" style="s2">registered nurse, sales account executive.</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.340" end="01:06:00.550" style="s2">These are actually empirically derived, by<br />the way.</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.550" end="01:06:05.040" style="s2">So the Wonderlic company has tested a very<br />large number of people.</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.040" end="01:06:09.790" style="s2">And so these are the actual averages of the<br />professions that they are describing--it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.790" end="01:06:15.500" style="s2">not hypothetical.</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.500" end="01:06:28.530" style="s2">103 to 108, so that&#39;s the 60 to the 70th percentile:<br />clerk, customer service rep, computer operator,</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.530" end="01:06:33.870" style="s2">medical debt collector, secretary, accounting<br />clerk, general sales, telephone sales, assistant</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.870" end="01:06:37.660" style="s2">manager, credit clerk, drafter, designer,<br />bookkeeper.</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.660" end="01:06:45.180" style="s2">There&#39;s a lot of white-collar, like low level,<br />entry level, white collar jobs in that particular</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.180" end="01:06:46.180" style="s2">category.</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.180" end="01:06:51.700" style="s2">So that would be the brighter people among<br />the high school students who didn&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.700" end="01:06:53.090" style="s2">college and university.</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.090" end="01:06:59.930" style="s2">IQ, this is dead average, 50th to the 55th<br />percentile: police officer, receptionist,</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.930" end="01:07:06.950" style="s2">cashier, general clerical staff, inside sales<br />clerk, meter reader, printer, teller, data</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.950" end="01:07:10.550" style="s2">entry, electrical, helper, dispatcher, general<br />office.</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.550" end="01:07:13.040" style="s2">So that&#39;s right at 100.</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.040" end="01:07:20.920" style="s2">95 to 98, so that&#39;s the 42nd to the 45th percentile:<br />quality control checker, claims clerk, security</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.920" end="01:07:22.830" style="s2">guard or unskilled labourer.</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.830" end="01:07:30.301" style="s2">So look, the unskilled labourers are up at<br />95th of 98, so that&#39;s--at the unskilled labour</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.301" end="01:07:34.100" style="s2">level you still have an IQ that&#39;s higher than<br />40% of the population.</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.100" end="01:07:38.350" style="s2">Ark welder, die setter, mechanic, medical<br />dental assistant.</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.350" end="01:07:46.990" style="s2">IQ 87 to 93: messenger, factory production<br />worker, assembler, food service worker, nurse&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.990" end="01:07:50.350" style="s2">aid, warehouseman, custodian, janitor, material<br />handler, and packer.</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.350" end="01:07:58.700" style="s2">Okay, so now what you see happening--it looks<br />to me like you can conceptualize jobs most</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.700" end="01:08:02.190" style="s2">simply with a two by two matrix.</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.190" end="01:08:08.090" style="s2">Okay, so there&#39;s managerial/administrative<br />jobs and creative jobs--that&#39;s the first one--and</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.090" end="01:08:11.080" style="s2">then there&#39;s low complexity/high complexity.</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.080" end="01:08:16.310" style="s2">And so, what you&#39;re starting to fall into<br />at the 21st to the 37th percentile--so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.310" end="01:08:20.929" style="s2">still one person in three--are low complexity,<br />managerial jobs.</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.929" end="01:08:26.119" style="s2">And so what I mean by that is, if you&#39;re in<br />a low complexity job, imagine you&#39;re responsible</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.119" end="01:08:27.880" style="s2">for 30 things.</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.880" end="01:08:31.289" style="s2">But roughly speaking, it&#39;s the same 30 things<br />all the time.</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.289" end="01:08:35.559" style="s2">And roughly speaking, they have to be taken<br />care of the same way each time.</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.559" end="01:08:40.529" style="s2">So you have a finite domain of responsibility<br />and you can master it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.529" end="01:08:45.039" style="s2">And IQ will predict how fast you master it,<br />but once you master it, it won&#39;t predict how</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.039" end="01:08:46.130" style="s2">well you do.</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.130" end="01:08:50.940" style="s2">What happens then, in all likelihood, is that<br />conscientiousness starts to predict, or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.940" end="01:08:54.870" style="s2">emotional stability starts to predict, or<br />some of the other personality factors start</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.870" end="01:08:55.960" style="s2">to become more important.</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.960" end="01:09:03.870" style="s2">So, but at 87 to 93, you&#39;re down at the level<br />of custodian and janitor.</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.870" end="01:09:05.909" style="s2">And then that&#39;s that.</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.909" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">And that&#39;s not so good because you have the<br />bottom 15-20% of the population who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:19.460" style="s2">have a cognitive ability at that level.</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.460" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">And so one of the things that you&#39;re going<br />to hear a lot about as you get older is reasons</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:26.929" style="s2">for unemployment.</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.929" end="01:09:30.759" style="s2">And one of the prime reasons for unemployment<br />in the future is increasingly going to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.759" end="01:09:35.789" style="s2">that there is just nothing for someone of<br />that level of intelligence to do.</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.789" end="01:09:40.380" style="s2">And this is partly why people hate IQ, because<br />you think, that is a nasty nasty thing to</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.380" end="01:09:41.380" style="s2">conclude.</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.380" end="01:09:42.739" style="s2">Let me tell you a story.</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.739" end="01:09:51.039" style="s2">So, I had a client at one point who I suspected<br />he had a verbal IQ of about 85 and a non-verbal</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.039" end="01:09:52.540" style="s2">IQ that was lower.</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.540" end="01:09:57.869" style="s2">He had other psychological issues, but we&#39;ll<br />just concentrate on that one for the time</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.869" end="01:10:01.590" style="s2">being.</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.590" end="01:10:04.579" style="s2">And he had a hard time finding a job.</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.579" end="01:10:10.020" style="s2">He was socially anxious and that didn&#39;t help,<br />but even if he could overcome that it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.020" end="01:10:15.130" style="s2">very difficult for him to master the basic<br />skills that were involved in what you would</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.130" end="01:10:18.110" style="s2">consider even relatively straightforward tasks.</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.110" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">I spent a lot of time trying to find him a<br />job, which was insanely difficult.</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:29.650" style="s2">He went to the government first to get help,<br />and they told him to type up his resume on</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.650" end="01:10:32.400" style="s2">a computer and distribute it--it&#39;s like, well<br />that wasn&#39;t very helpful because he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.400" end="01:10:37.010" style="s2">know how to use a computer and he wasn&#39;t going<br />to type up his damn resume.</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.010" end="01:10:41.290" style="s2">It was, &quot;if you want to get a job, go out<br />and do the things that it would take to get</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.290" end="01:10:42.290" style="s2">a job.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.290" end="01:10:45.079" style="s2">Well yeah, if you can do that then you don&#39;t<br />have a problem.</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.079" end="01:10:49.869" style="s2">And so the government agencies were completely<br />useless, and they were staffed by people who</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.869" end="01:10:54.019" style="s2">would assume that if you didn&#39;t do what you<br />were advised to, then you just didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.019" end="01:10:55.019" style="s2">to have a job.</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.019" end="01:10:56.820" style="s2">Instead of ever thinking that maybe you couldn&#39;t<br />do it.</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.820" end="01:11:01.260" style="s2">It&#39;s not the easy to use a computer.</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.260" end="01:11:05.940" style="s2">And then I tried to get him a volunteer job--well<br />you can bloody well forget about that because</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.940" end="01:11:09.389" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to get a volunteer job than it<br />is to get a real job.</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.389" end="01:11:12.960" style="s2">And the reason for that is that you have to<br />step through a number of complex bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.960" end="01:11:16.040" style="s2">hoops, including having a police check.</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.040" end="01:11:19.960" style="s2">And you know, first of all that&#39;s intimidating<br />as hell for people, even if they haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.960" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">anything wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:22.750" style="s2">And second, it&#39;s not that straightforward.</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.750" end="01:11:28.300" style="s2">It involves manoeuvring through a complicated<br />bureaucracy, and that&#39;s not the only step.</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.300" end="01:11:29.510" style="s2">There&#39;s all sorts of other steps.</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.510" end="01:11:32.999" style="s2">So volunteer work, that&#39;s out man.</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.999" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">That&#39;s just not going to happen, not generally<br />speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:42.770" style="s2">And then I found him a job helping a guy out<br />who had a bicycle shop/book store--kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.770" end="01:11:46.969" style="s2">a strange combination--but it was a government<br />subsidized temporary position.</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.969" end="01:11:51.019" style="s2">And then, he did a good job at it--he was<br />reshelving books and that sort of thing--and</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.019" end="01:11:52.320" style="s2">so he was reliable.</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.320" end="01:11:53.329" style="s2">He could do that.</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.329" end="01:11:59.060" style="s2">But, you know, the subsidy program ended and<br />of course, if you run a bike shop/book store</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.060" end="01:12:03.449" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you have additional money to<br />hire someone because, that&#39;s a store that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.449" end="01:12:08.440" style="s2">just not going to be generating maybe any<br />income, but certainly not enough to hire someone.</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.440" end="01:12:10.269" style="s2">So that fell apart.</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.269" end="01:12:18.539" style="s2">Then I made a bunch of personal contacts with<br />charity organizations to see if I could get</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.539" end="01:12:19.539" style="s2">him a volunteer position.</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.539" end="01:12:22.059" style="s2">I finally got him a volunteer position.</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.059" end="01:12:27.900" style="s2">And then I went with him to train at the volunteer<br />position, and that was so enlightening.</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.900" end="01:12:35.559" style="s2">So what he had to do was, he had a stack of<br />pieces of paper here and then a stack of envelopes</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.559" end="01:12:41.380" style="s2">here, and in principle the pieces of paper--which<br />were letters--were in the same order as the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.380" end="01:12:42.760" style="s2">envelopes were.</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.760" end="01:12:46.650" style="s2">And so what he had to do was fold the pieces<br />of paper three times and stuff the folded</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.650" end="01:12:50.860" style="s2">piece of paper into the envelope and the seal<br />the envelope and then put it here.</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.860" end="01:12:55.719" style="s2">But it was a bit more complicated than that<br />because sometimes the letters were in French</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.719" end="01:13:01.269" style="s2">and sometimes they were in English, so what<br />that meant was that he had to watch and see</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.269" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">that the French envelopes went into this stack<br />and the English envelopes went into that stack.</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:08.429" style="s2">So that&#39;s one degree of complexity, right.</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.429" end="01:13:12.210" style="s2">But then it also turned out that those damned<br />envelopes had to be run through an automatic</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.210" end="01:13:14.050" style="s2">letter sorting machine.</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.050" end="01:13:17.710" style="s2">Now you might think, well that doesn&#39;t matter,<br />but it does matter because those things have</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.710" end="01:13:21.930" style="s2">very tightly defined tolerances.</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.930" end="01:13:28.579" style="s2">And if you make a mistake--imagine you fold<br />a piece of paper and the first time you fold</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.579" end="01:13:31.239" style="s2">it you made a mistake of an eighth of an inch.</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.239" end="01:13:34.080" style="s2">And then the next time you fold it you make<br />another eighth of an inch mistake.</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.080" end="01:13:39.469" style="s2">That means your piece of paper is now one<br />quarter inch out of truth.</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.469" end="01:13:43.540" style="s2">And then you stuff it in the envelope and<br />fold it, but then you crinkle the envelope.</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.540" end="01:13:47.960" style="s2">And so then the envelope gets stuck in the<br />automatic processing machine.</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.960" end="01:13:54.050" style="s2">So I taught him probably 20 hours, how to<br />fold this piece of paper into three.</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.050" end="01:13:59.969" style="s2">You know, and he was a bit shaky, and he just<br />didn&#39;t have the fine motor ability or the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.969" end="01:14:02.219" style="s2">cognitive ability to do that.</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.219" end="01:14:07.760" style="s2">And then--I&#39;ll end with this--when he finally<br />couldn&#39;t do it anymore, what happened was</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">the letters came with photographs attached<br />to them.</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:14.239" style="s2">And then he had to fold the pieces of paper<br />around the photographs in a way that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.239" end="01:14:17.810" style="s2">crumple the photographs so that they could<br />still fit into the envelopes.</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.810" end="01:14:24.960" style="s2">And each photo was stapled, maybe half an<br />inch different, per piece of paper.</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.960" end="01:14:30.079" style="s2">So then he had to fold them properly with<br />a different folding technique for every piece</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.079" end="01:14:34.679" style="s2">of paper, and he had to sort them into French<br />and English, and then also if the envelopes</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.679" end="01:14:38.840" style="s2">and the papers ever got out of sync--which<br />they did now and then--he had to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.840" end="01:14:42.300" style="s2">how to sort the envelopes and the pieces of<br />paper to make sure that they were matched</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.300" end="01:14:43.300" style="s2">with the proper envelope.</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.300" end="01:14:44.499" style="s2">It was like, no.</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.499" end="01:14:47.900" style="s2">That was the end of it.</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.900" end="01:14:52.059" style="s2">And so I&#39;ll tell you the rest of this story<br />later.</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.059" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">So anyways, the moral of the story is if you&#39;re<br />smart, you&#39;re privileged and, thank god, make</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:00.190" style="s2">use of it.</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.190" end="01:15:04.849" style="s2">And if you&#39;re on the low end of the IQ distribution,<br />man, you&#39;ve got one tough life ahead of you.</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.849" end="01:15:09.179" style="s2">It has nothing to do with willingness to work,<br />or virtually nothing.</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.179" end="01:15:23.989" style="s2">And it&#39;s a good thing to know, even though<br />it&#39;s horrible.</p>
