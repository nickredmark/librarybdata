<p begin="00:00:35.680" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">go for it yeah all right so i understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">we have a</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:43.760" style="s2">correction off the top but um let me</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:47.200" style="s2">before even going right there at the top</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.200" end="00:00:52.239" style="s2">uh because we have many new viewers um</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:53.920" style="s2">there have been questions about how it</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.239" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">is that people get questions to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">us uh so uh if you&#39;re watching this live</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">uh you can uh do a super chat question</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">which involves paying</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">to youtube and we will take as many of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">those super chat questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:13.360" style="s2">based on how much you you uh gave</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">in the first hour and in the second hour</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.360" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">we will</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">um take as many of your questions as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">can based on the order in which you</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.040" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">you put them in so and then each hour</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">each each episode we will take some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">the few that we missed the previous time</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">that we thought were particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s about super chat and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">no idea what i&#39;m talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">you&#39;re live</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">in youtube right now we have i believe a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">moderator</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">there who will be able to answer</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">questions if you don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">so so i should also just say we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">asking for money but uh since we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">so um colorfully ejected from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">academy</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">uh this is a large fraction of how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">keep our family float so we very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">the support that you give us through</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">this mechanism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">so far it has been working pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">we are um</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">hopefully going to deliver a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:09.759" style="s2">that will improve the functionality uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">even more in the near term so keep your</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">eye out for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">yeah exactly okay so correction right</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">off the bat last time in episode 37</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">we talked about a paper</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">uh published in nature finding that uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">uvc light in the 207 to 222 nanometer</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.560" style="s2">range</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">uh has proven to be effective against</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">uh several coronaviruses they did not</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">actually check stars cove too but to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">they have also found it effective</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">against uh influenza</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">and so uh extrapolating they thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">okay maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">maybe this is actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">effective um and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">we then had a discussion i i love</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">discussion this is not on you at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">um in which while i didn&#39;t explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">say i basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">implied very strongly that um that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">there this is one more piece of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">that being outside</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">is going to be effective against um</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">coronavirus and there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">lots of evidence that being outside is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">actually protective</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">um but uvc light and this was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">i first was alerted to this in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">superchat question from last time</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">the uvc light actually doesn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">the earth&#39;s surface</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">that uvc is in the 100 to 280 nanometer</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">range</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">and between 100 and 200 nanometers or so</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">it&#39;s totally blocked by</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">o2 by just diatomic oxygen and between</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">200</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">and 280 nanometers it&#39;s blocked by</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">triatomic</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">oxygen which is also known as ozone</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:40.400" style="s2">so the ozone layer also blocks a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">the uvb light which is up to 315</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.400" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">nanometers and uva</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">is almost entirely unblocked by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">and so it&#39;s the ground that&#39;s in the 315</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">to 400 nanometer range so</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">all of that is a little bit a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">technical and maybe more than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">wants to know but the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">is that uh the germicidal uv</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">light in hvac systems and closets and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">in a number of places um could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">very effective uh but this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">place it seems that spending time</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">outdoors is actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">directly helpful in combating</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">um either trans getting being having co</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">stars go to transmitted to you or uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">having a lower uh uh lower virulence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">the disease coping 19 should you get it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">so i just want to unpack this a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">bit because the message here</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">is complex it&#39;s an error correction that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">as far as i can tell has</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">zero implication for what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">the outside is still</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">very safe especially during the day when</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">uv light</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">does some purifying though that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">apparently not the only reason that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">outdoors is safe even at night you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">the large volume of air which reduces</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">the uh viral load below the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">that you&#39;re likely to get it so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">outdoors is great and as we keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">the clock is ticking</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">if you&#39;re in the northern hemisphere the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">sun is shining spend some time outside</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">now because winter is coming and you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">going to be driven</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">indoors much more than you&#39;d like so</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">just even at the level</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">of your mental well-being drink in as</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">much of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">beautiful outdoor stuff as possible so</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">that when you&#39;re stuck inside in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">february</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve been trapped</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">for a year yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">speaking of a bit uh we had talked early</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">uh you you had suggested that you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">concerned um</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">in you know april may about what was</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">going to happen to the homeless</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:28.880" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">um because um they were so packed</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.880" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">together and they basically have nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">um and you know interestingly we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">um vast outbreaks among the homeless</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">well what don&#39;t the homeless have access</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s indoor spaces for the most part and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">even when they do they often</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">aren&#39;t choosing to to go there right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">populations even um within sort of tent</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">cities</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">are being exposed to high air flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">almost all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">and so have relatively low density of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">the viral particles</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">which are which are necessary for both</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">being getting the disease and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">having worse outcomes higher density</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">means higher likelihood of contracting</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">and worse outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">now if i might i would like to tack a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">couple things onto this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">um important correction with no</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">implications for your behavior oh so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">point of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">study then was that we could introduce</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">this uvc into our indoor environments</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">where it would be useful but it would</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">done technologically and it see it seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">to have as far as we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">it has now adverse health effects uvc</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">right so all of the you know beware of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">uv</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">that we hear about with regard to skin</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">cancers</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">itself requires an asterisk for sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">because there is good evidence and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">haven&#39;t pulled it up so i can&#39;t i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">pinpoint exactly the papers but</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">um actually the protective effects of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">the uva uvb</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">light seems to outweigh the risks of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">skin cancers so that that is an aside</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">but uvc even among the people even among</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">the you know the many dermatologists who</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">will say</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">absolutely never should you be exposed</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">to uv light you need to slide yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">with sunscreen and wear hats at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">times and all this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">um no one is saying at the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">there are adverse health effects to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">exposure to uvc but of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">given that we haven&#39;t been exposed</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">because we&#39;ve always lived on this</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">who knows who knows what we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">noticing right now there are a couple</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">things i&#39;ve got attack on here because</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">during my uh telomere phase as you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">recall</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">um there was a uh a discovery that gave</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.160" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">particular joy associated with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">that dermatologists</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">were talking themselves silly about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">observation the expectation was</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">that exposure to uv causes cancer every</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">everybody who was dermatologically aware</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">knew that but it was becoming clear that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">people that have very sun damaged skin</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">farm workers cowboys people who work</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">under the hot sun</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">enough that their skin is visibly sun</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">damaged have very low rates of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">right and so uh it happens that my</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">telomere work</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">gives us exactly the reason for this and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">it tells you where to draw the line</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">so first of all sun damaged skin is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">damaged</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:10.639" style="s2">right um it loses its elasticity it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.639" end="00:08:13.759" style="s2">the jobs that skin does that&#39;s a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">young skin does</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.759" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">as well as it doesn&#39;t do it as well as</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:20.879" style="s2">healthy young skin</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">but if you are exposed to the sun</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.879" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">continuously and it is damaging tissue</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">such that you are basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">turning over your cells at a high rate</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">but you are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">getting so much intensity that it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">causing genetic damage which causes</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">which is mutations which cause tumors</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">and what you are doing is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">aging your skin</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">artificially quickly but if you&#39;re aging</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">it without</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">mutating it then the point is that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">expending</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">your lifetime capacity for repair and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">your lifetime capacity for repair</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">is what gives you the danger of tumors</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">the capacity of one cell to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">itself many times</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">after it&#39;s had a mutation gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">big patch of cells that can get a second</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">mutation that will turn it into a tumor</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">but people whose skin is artificially</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">old because they&#39;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">in the hot sun without getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">sunburns they are they when they get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">mutation</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">it creates a much smaller patch of cells</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">and so they are actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">protected by the damage so so once your</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">skin</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">is no longer capable of repair you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">ever have youthful looking skin again</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">but you are also very unlikely to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">cancer in that skin</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t get uh sunburns along the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the key thing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">so this also explains the other</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">interesting phenomenon which was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">long known which was that sun burns are</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">the thing that leads to cancer but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">early sunburns that lead to cancer later</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">in your life</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">so the early sun burns you get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">mutation in a cell from uv light</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">that cell then starts reproducing uh in</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">unregulated way it becomes a patch of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">cells which is a mole basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.040" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">and then it stops at its telomeric limit</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">well the bigger the patch of cells is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">when it reaches that limit the greater</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">the chance that one of those cells will</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">get a second mutation</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">that frees it from the limit and turns</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">it into a tumor so</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">anyway the the bottom line here at some</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">level is</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">uh biology is always a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">and the answers aren&#39;t necessarily what</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">you expect and you know turns out</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">sunscreen which we were told that we you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">know shouldn&#39;t dare go outside without</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">it uh during the summer it has many</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">negative effects</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">that going out in the sun has many</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">positive effects that those effects are</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">not necessarily ones you&#39;d predict like</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">the vitamin d protective effect against</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">kovid</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">so let&#39;s um let&#39;s actually just talk a</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">um what what we have done and what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">did with our with our kids</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">early on when all of the advice and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">every time we&#39;d send them to school or</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">camp or something we were told you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">you have to pack a tube of sunscreen and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">probably come back empty and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">we didn&#39;t do this um so i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">share just a little bit about you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">how and how and why um but also say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">um your point that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">early sunburn predicts later cancer</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">uh does raise the issue of okay what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">the boundary between a burn and a tan</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">and yo tan is this protective response</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">by the skin</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">but of course almost everyone has had</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">experience of you know spending a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">bit too much time outside thinking you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">got away with it thinking it went to tan</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">and then finding that it was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">burn underneath and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">this like basically boundaries between</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">categories and every complex system that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">you can name</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">is fuzzy right and so you know you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">to avoid getting too near that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">that border between tan and burn as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">well i agree</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">the problem is it&#39;s fuzzy in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">in other words</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">you will have a burn before you have any</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">evidence that you have a burn</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">on the other hand experience is analog</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">but the actual like did it mutate or did</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">it not is digital</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">well it&#39;s not even did it mutate because</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">you may not end up with a mutation</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">did you damage tissue such that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">requires replacement so that you end up</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">with the sloughing of skin that comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">with the burn</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">the alternative being your skin</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">anticipates damage based on detecting a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">lot of sunlight and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">darkens if you&#39;re light skinned it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">darkens the color of your skin</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">in order to protect the cells that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">there and so the tan</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">the sweet spot is where you got enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:22.800" style="s2">sun to trigger this but you didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">so much sun that you damaged tissue and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.800" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:28.720" style="s2">genetic damage is one layer beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">worry about now here&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">so i used to burn very very easily and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:37.839" style="s2">did get some of those sunburns uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">in youth that tend to predispose a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.839" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">person to skin cancer</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">but i&#39;ve also learned just by observing</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">my own interaction</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">with the world how to manage it without</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">sunscreen right</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">so that hat on my twitter profile is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:54.000" style="s2">part of my strategy when i&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">field especially in the tropics is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">that&#39;s great it&#39;s also great for rain</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">um it keeps the rain off of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:02.399" style="s2">off of your face which is really very</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">useful but that&#39;s a great conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.399" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">starter</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a terrible conversation starter</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">people assume it&#39;s some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">prop right um but anyway the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">that i learned about myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">which i&#39;ve now taught my kids and when</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">they think of it it works for them too</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">is that you can get a lot of sun</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">exposure where you&#39;re headed towards a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">burn</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">and then you can take a short break like</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">a five minute break in the shade or if</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">there&#39;s no shade you can turn so a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">different side of you is facing the sun</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">and it seems to reset some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">counter and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">the thing that i think is interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">it suggests an</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">a process that is analogous to what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">now know about covet infection</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">so covet infection at least as our</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">current model looks</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">there&#39;s like a bucket and that bucket as</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">long as it doesn&#39;t reach the top</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">means that even if you encountered some</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">covid you&#39;re very unlikely to get sick</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">it&#39;s only when the bucket overflows</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">because you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">exposure over some period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">the bucket filled up</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re likely to get it which means</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re outside which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">constantly emptying the bucket you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">very low risk</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">so viral particles fly away from you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">right and so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">and uh i&#39;d be hard-pressed to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">what it is i don&#39;t know but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">the mechanism with respect to the sun</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">damage</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the skin that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">able to tolerate a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">sun intensity and if you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">building it up</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">you it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a bucket that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">has a hose in it</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">that&#39;s bigger you know that&#39;s putting in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">more water than the leak in the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">side of the bucket the bucket eventually</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:34.880" style="s2">overflows</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">but if you allow it to drain and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">draining in the case of the sun exposure</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just a matter of giving it some</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">time in which you&#39;re not bombarding it</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">with new</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">sunlight it seems to reset something and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">so the thing that&#39;s surprising to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">is that it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like you catch</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">an hour in the sun</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">you need a half an hour in the shade</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">it&#39;s half an hour in the sun you need</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">two or three minutes in the shade nor</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.399" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">can you just count up the number of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">you want to spend in the sun and say</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">okay i&#39;m just going to take that all at</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">you know say say you have skin that can</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">tolerate three hours</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">um that you have calculated can tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">three hours in the sun</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">at a time well that&#39;s that&#39;s youthful</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">and extraordinarily sun resilient skin</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:16.800" style="s2">um but actually say you did it for three</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">hours you could probably take a break</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">and at three hours you need maybe 15 20</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:23.279" style="s2">and go back out again yeah now this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">really does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.279" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">the experience i have i have less direct</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">empirical experience just because i</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t tend to burn but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">seen it with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">and both of our children as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">the other the last thing i would say and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">first of all this is just my experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not uh it&#39;s anecdote at</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">so your mileage is almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">going to vary and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">figure out your own pattern um but i</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">sometimes find that when i blow it a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">little bit and i go too far</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">and i know this because when i come in</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">finally you know my skin is hot</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s like i did is that a burn you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:00.320" style="s2">can go a certain amount too far</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t end up being a burn</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.320" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">so there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">uh you have exceeded tolerances but not</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">so much that it&#39;s gone critical</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">phase which allows you to actually know</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">where you are in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">finding that border but it requires that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">you pay attention to the feedback your</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">body is giving you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">yeah it requires that you have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">of what your skin</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">and your breathing and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">about your physiology normally feels</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">like so that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">it begins to send you warning signals</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.360" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.240" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">you are in a position to read them and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">to receive them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">absolutely and a lot of things work this</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">way medically speaking we&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">attention to the patterns even if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the underlying mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">is you can uh manage things absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">all right shall we get on to um the</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">going to need to change</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">we&#39;re asking that people remove</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">themselves from this area for the safety</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">of the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">if they care about people they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">to have to try to help us</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">to make it safe not opposed to anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">issue or concerned</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">they certainly can&#39;t demonstrate you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">know and peacefully any place</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">but they can&#39;t possibly take over a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">neighborhood and cause the crime levels</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">to go up like this</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">two men are dead two men are dead</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">and a child a 14 year old is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">hospitalized and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">what is going to happen to that kid</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">enough is enough here</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">so we can&#39;t hear that when you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.760" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">uh she finishes with enough is enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">and this was back</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">on june 29th this is a press conference</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">that she held on june 29th</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">and and now she&#39;s done she&#39;s just she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">going to take it anymore well</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">she has faced some uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">she has had a significant pay cut yep</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">and she has also had her home protested</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">and so in some sense what is taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">place is you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">a police chief who&#39;s being hamstrung</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">in her job who is now being exposed</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">to very personal attacks i mean imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">having people</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">protest you doing your job at your</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">home that&#39;s a very threatening</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">phenomenon not just socially</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">and then these uh insane demands to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">defund the police</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">right um are actually which are what</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">her um having to accept a pay cut if she</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">had a significant pay cut if she was to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">keep her job</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:42.559" style="s2">right and so this is now um</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the mirror of the star of the beast</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.559" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">that the right has employed against</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">where the idea is well maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">attack the structures themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">but you eliminate their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">function you you strangle them</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">financially if the point is</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">let&#39;s render these institutions so bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">that everyone can agree that they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">not functional and therefore need to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">disappeared entirely</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">defunding them first is a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">first step</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">so uh you know how how can you guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">that policing will get worse rather than</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">you give it fewer resources uh you give</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">less time</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">for you know mental health checks and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">actual legitimate and real training</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">and uh you lower the pay so that people</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">who are considering going into the force</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">are less likely to choose that job</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">and you uh will therefore as fewer and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">fewer people want to join the force have</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">to lower the standards of people you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">accept into the force</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">this is guaranteed the defund the police</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">even if we only accept it as</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">a even if we accept the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">mild version of what defund the police</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">means which we&#39;ve talked before about</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">whether or not that is actually what</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">what is being argued for but even if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">just accept that what people are arguing</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">for is that money has to be pulled out</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">of of policing you know is is there</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">excess in police departments as in every</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">other bureaucratic department in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">certainly right but the idea that we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">going to pull money</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">and therefore make it a less attractive</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">job for people</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">thus guaranteeing that the people who go</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">into it are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">less likely to be the highly empathic</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">and skilled people who we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">as our policemen is guaranteed to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">police brutality worse rather than</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">yeah and the simple fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">being asked to consider</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">how we would like to see police</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">resourced in</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">isolation is is evidence that this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">not an honest conversation we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">involved in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">it is quite possible that you could get</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.520" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">away with half as many police</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">but you would get away with half as many</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">police by virtue of the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">had taken care of the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">police are now</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">forced to take care of by other</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">mechanisms and of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">we will be told that well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">we&#39;re saying just shift that money into</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">community programs</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">you cannot start there if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:08.480" style="s2">render</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">the police uh less necessary by fixing</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.480" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">other parts of society you have to start</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">with that if you pull the police</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">first even if you shun stuff into other</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">programs that you think are going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">work first of all you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">going to work</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that the political</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">structure will end up maintaining that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">there what you&#39;re simply going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:29.360" style="s2">reduce the level of enforcement and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">therefore you&#39;re going to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">brutality of it because</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">in part the brutality of policing is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:38.799" style="s2">mechanism for doing it on the cheap</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">right and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.799" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">true it&#39;s been noted by many people</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">um that police have begun to do you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">untrained for this work and never what</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">policing was supposed to be about</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">some of the basically first responders</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">on mental health issues</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">right and this is not uh where what we</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">what we should want our police to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">doing and i can basically guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s not what the police want to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">yeah right no one wants to be called in</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">to respond</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">to the mental health situations when</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">they are not themselves and that is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">the career they have chosen nor are they</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">trained to do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">so do we need systems in place with</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">people who are trained to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">dealing with the mental health crises</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:19.120" style="s2">that we are seeing revealed</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">on our streets and in you know the many</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.120" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">domestic abuse calls for instance</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">for sure but uh that that money</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.400" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">those those systems have to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">functional before you start to unravel</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">uh the policing system yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">not really what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">debated no this is this is a uh a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:38.320" style="s2">movement that has discovered that it has</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.320" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">and your willingness to accept that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">police should</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">obviously be defunded is a litmus test</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">to see whether you are for us or against</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">well this reminds me rather a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">what happened at yes evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">right i mean we we we had this carmen</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">as far as i understand it has been the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">police chief in seattle for for not too</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">many years but she&#39;s been on the force</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">for almost 30.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">and i think she was seattle&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">african-american police chief</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">and of course in a in a movement just as</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">in a movement that is declaring itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:17.679" style="s2">to be a bla about black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">uh why is it that black men are being</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.679" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">killed</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">and you know in a movement that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">proclaims to be about black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">why is it that seattle&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">african-american police chief</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">is feeling that it is that is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">for her to step down this is clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">um you know being being black isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">sufficient to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">uh to be exalted in this movement you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">of a particular political bent in order</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">to be exalted in this movement</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">she was herself an evergreen alum she</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">was explicitly about uh working on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">policy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">anti-police brutality and trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">relationships between police</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">and their constituents and she took no</p>

<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">from moment one from her swearing-in</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">ceremony uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:19.120" style="s2">from the people at evergreen and sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">enough she was stood down and she ended</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.120" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">up having to resign because</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">because she had the authority to do her</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">job taken away from her</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">by in the case of evergreen the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">president of evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">and she felt that if she remained in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:38.799" style="s2">someone was going to get hurt or worse</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">and that that she would feel responsible</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.799" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">for it even though she had had</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">all of the ability to do her job taken</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">away from her</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">this i am sure is what police chiefs</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">all over the country are now feeling yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:55.120" style="s2">and we also have the obvious test</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">of the insight of those who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">demanding these changes so those who</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">have now</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">driven chief best from office</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">have instituted their utopia at small</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">it very quickly resulted in shootings</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">including a fatal shooting um it</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">extortion from shop owners and basements</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">and rapes and assaults</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">right yep so the point is this is a test</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">of the claim that the community can</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">police itself better</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">no it can some of us knew that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">coming but okay now you&#39;ve tested it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">a major american city and you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">what happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">you saw this at evergreen inside of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">hours of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">the president of the college standing</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">the police down</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">you had a violent mob students were uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">attacked um you had them stopping</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:45.039" style="s2">traffic looking apparently</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">hobbled the local police resulting in</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">and now it has moved into neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">very shocking video of these rioters now</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">and how much better things will be if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">eliminate it how much evidence would you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">need that they have no fucking clue what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">the role that policing plays</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">in our country yeah they don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">obvious every time they try it</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">they can&#39;t keep it together for you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">a week</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">that&#39;s right um and just we might</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">the former police chief stepped down and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">i think appointed him</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">um he skipped a number of rungs in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">usual hierarchy to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">obtain this position he is himself a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">black man</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">and he says i mean this is a this is a</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">it says things like people here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">um this here people protested peacefully</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">while others engaged in dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:27.279" style="s2">activities that could have resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">injury and even death</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.279" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">so we have we have the police chief</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">of the city that we happen to live in</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">that has been</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">at the forefront of the media fight for</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">uh and neither of the polarized</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">sides of the mainstream media narrative</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">have gotten this right</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">and you know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">this before and and and so have others</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">no the city was not on fire nor was it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">limited to two square blocks</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">no uh the protesters were not the only</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">people on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">reliably like clockwork uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">relatively shortly after the sun went</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:12.960" style="s2">down um and sometimes later</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">uh the protesters became rioters</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.960" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">some of those are the same people many</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:18.399" style="s2">of them are not it was like a change of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">scene</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.399" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">um yes actually i want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">put something up here is that could you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">put up the thing on propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.039" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">so what i&#39;m going to show you here is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:36.320" style="s2">blog post</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">that came up on the portland subreddit</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.320" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">today can you scroll up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">so this is a remarkable piece</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">in which a strategy called</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">uh darvo is that right the second</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:53.919" style="s2">paragraph there</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">institutional darvo yeah so what this</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">which stands for deny attack and reverse</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">victim and offender</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:03.039" style="s2">yes so your brain is about to hurt if</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">you try to puzzle through this this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.039" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">um somebody associated with this protest</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">riot movement who is arguing</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">that the government is now engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">kind of propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">in which they are attacking innocent</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">that they are reversing victim and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">victimizer</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">for the purpose of gaslighting the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">into thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">that the protesters are violent</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">now the problem here is that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">exact inverse of the story</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">i can&#39;t say it&#39;s the exact inverse in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">every instance</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">has any cop misbehaved during this</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">probably oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">and we know that we know that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">they are describing the exact strategy</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">that they are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">they are pretending to be a non-violent</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">movement but there is a reliable shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">each and every night and really i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s each and every night for the last</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">70 there&#39;s been a reliable shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">in the direction of violence that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">violence has been directed at federal</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">buildings now it&#39;s being directed</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:03.679" style="s2">at the police union and neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">and the point is look there&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">set of demands here that we can evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">right the demand is effectively oh get</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">rid of the police</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">right how many what fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">population actually thinks is a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">tiny if even that but get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">police is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">the excuse for</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">a violent attack on the structures</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">of civilization that demands some kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">of response</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">now i&#39;m not excited to see that response</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">in my city i don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">seeing police dressed up in riot gear</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">you know roughing people up throwing</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">them into vans any of this stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">the alternative apparently is letting</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">them do what they want which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">make any sense so</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t and you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">things i&#39;ve seen in the local press</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">is this claim that oh well literally</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">portland is a protest city like anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">that happens and people just go on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">streets people</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">show up because portland is about</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">protest and frankly i&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">that before</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">we moved here this and you know now</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">looking back at some of the history like</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">actually this this seems to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">the ethos that you you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">you have any kind of grievance at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna people are gonna protest</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">will that be exacerbated under</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">conditions of lockdown 100</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">of course they are this is where people</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">go instead of clubs and bars because</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">there are no clubs and bars</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">slightly at the moment but not still</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">really uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">but you know the idea of that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">we protest really puts the lie to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">legitimacy of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">any given protest like how like people</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">sort of categorically less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">protest or more likely to protest and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">that&#39;s a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">thing to recognize about a population i</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">suppose but</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">if if the local media</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:54.159" style="s2">is saying without any irony whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">well of course there&#39;s protests that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.159" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">what we do doesn&#39;t that then</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">mean that maybe taking people at their</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">word that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">they are protesting because this new</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">thing happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">is less legitimate if protest happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">for anything and everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">then the any given reason that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">trotted out for why protests is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">seems less legitimate because actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">what you&#39;ve already told us is you</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">protest because you protest</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">you don&#39;t protest because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">cause for it</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">this is the flip side of the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">i always say which is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">yes i&#39;m a liberal but i&#39;m a liberal that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">wants to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">change that will make society so good</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">that i get to be a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">and the point is if your point is no i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">always going to be demanding change then</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">we can&#39;t take your demand for change</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">seriously you&#39;re a liberal because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">want to be a liberal you&#39;re not not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">progressive because</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">change is inherently the right thing you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">we we want to obtain</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">something that is stable and still</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">and moving because the environment will</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">change but that is stable</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">such that we can afford to to love the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">state that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">well let&#39;s let&#39;s just put it simply a</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">change for its own sake is stupid</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:08.720" style="s2">sometimes you are going to do more harm</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">than good with change now</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">that&#39;s not where we are we&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">of positive change that we can engage in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">from here</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">but we should be frightened about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">downside of it this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">liberals tend to miss</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">is that the unintended consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">well-intended policies are sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">sufficient to um to argue against</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">implementing those policies at all</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">but i would say the flip and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">talked about this before but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">just the flip side of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">is that conservatives are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">miss the unintended consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">their innovations in the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">that then cause downstream effects right</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">they miss market failure and things like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">right um but nonetheless anybody whose</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">ethos is oh i&#39;m a change person yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">you&#39;re a changed person we haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">told you where you are you&#39;re a changed</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">no matter what right yeah i&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:56.639" style="s2">i&#39;m a restless person i always want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">be somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">other than where i am okay well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">on a ship would you like to stay on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">ship or you want to just step</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">off into the deep blue i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">um anyway we i we are always wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">with how to phrase this or where to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">stand so that you can actually see</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and increasingly i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve got some of the right elements</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">um on the table you know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">about an autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">reaction this a lot of this protest is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.760" style="s2">attacking the very things that make</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">things functional we&#39;ve talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.760" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">verificationism</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">that allows people to arrive at these</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">conclusions we&#39;ve talked about um the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">the uh movement itself appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:43.359" style="s2">involved in a kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.359" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">but you&#39;ve also talked about this uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">the sneetch&#39;s analogy yeah that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.359" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">something about what is being said</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">that appears to be devoid of content</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just group identifier stuff and it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">could be as arbitrary as a star on your</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.119" style="s2">belly</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">right and that we are confused by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.119" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">fact that there is content like oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">we should definitely defund the police</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">like that sounds like an argument</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">we should definitely defund the police</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">sounds like an analytical conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:17.520" style="s2">that arises from an analysis rather than</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">you know like you know it could just as</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">easily be oh i you know i hum at this</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">pitch</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">right you know yes you do well i do now</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">um but anyway so i&#39;ve been wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">with how to put these things together</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:32.160" style="s2">how to even think about them correctly</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">yeah and i came up with this model which</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.160" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">unfortunately i&#39;m going to hold up on a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">piece of paper which is kind of old</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">school but</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">um anyway let&#39;s see here&#39;s my piece of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">paper here&#39;s the model</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">that we are we live here in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">gully and the point is the political</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">winds can</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">push this ball one direction or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:53.599" style="s2">other and it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">revert back to the middle you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.599" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">liberals can get a little overly</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">enthusiastic with some of their</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">solution making and you know things</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">don&#39;t quite work out and then the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:04.560" style="s2">say told you so was never going to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">and they dragged things back a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">too far and we lose some of the gains</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">that can go on</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">indefinitely because what this is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">this depression there is mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">speaking a stable</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">equilibrium now the points i have</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">labeled a</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">and b here those are unstable equilibria</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">and the point is if you push this ball</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">far enough it reaches one of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">unstable equilibria and the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">that happens is you end up down here</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">wherever that is and my claim is going</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t have to be fascism and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">communism</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">but it might as well be the point is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">historical process that pushes that ball</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:50.359" style="s2">up to either a or b results in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">catastrophic uh destabilization a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.359" end="00:37:54.480" style="s2">disintegration</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">of something that was keeping you safe</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.480" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">and so my point is</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t always like it where you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">this gully here but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:03.760" style="s2">tolerable and what happens once you go</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">over one of these unstable equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.760" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">points</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">is you end up somewhere completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">intolerable and the real question for us</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">is a what does that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to argue that the snitch&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">business has a lot to do with it that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">the thing that tends to push you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">over the edge is something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">historically causes you</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">instead of thinking about things</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">analytically to default to team</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">okay but okay so sneetches you know mask</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">wearing sneak juice and sneetches</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">without maga hat wearing sneetches and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">sneetches with that&#39;s all the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">but the tribes that are defined by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">maga hat and the masks</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">and the stars on the bellies and all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">the rest</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:49.920" style="s2">are then slotted by their enemies into</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">particular buckets and so um you know we</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">have pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">often that at least used to be i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">sure if it still is but on the official</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">page we see and you know in interviews</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">with the founders uh we see them saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">actually this is marxist we&#39;re trained</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">in marxist</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">stuff and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">and so you know to your point oh is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">you know is it communism is it fascism</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">is it marxism is it fascism it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">need to be but those do seem to be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">two poles that we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">um oscillating between at least in terms</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">of mainstream media right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">and part of the problem i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:26.839" style="s2">this is maybe not exactly to your point</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">but i do think that part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.839" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">is there are many of us</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">actually on the left including many</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">people on the right who are saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">oh my god that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s marxism</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">proclaiming because they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">saying it and you should believe them</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:40.560" style="s2">when they say that that&#39;s actually what</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">they&#39;re doing because it looks like it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.560" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">and also</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t deny it so what the hell and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">by the way look at these 18 examples</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">from history where marxism doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">so let&#39;s not go there</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">on the other side you&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">trump&#39;s ascendancy to office is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">an indicator that we&#39;re about to descend</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">into fascism and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">there are um you know some people on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">right who</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">who see that there are pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">everyone in the far left you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">people who are actually rioting and some</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">number of the people who are protesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">on the streets see it that way</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">but there are also many of us on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">left who say</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">don&#39;t like the guy disagree with these</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:23.040" style="s2">policies don&#39;t think he&#39;s fit for office</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t look fascist right so um</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.040" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">we on the left can simultaneously say</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">don&#39;t want that particular executive</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">branch</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">to maintain but in terms of are we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">struggling between communism and fascism</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">it actually doesn&#39;t look like this thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">over in the republican party right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">is is fascist well no it</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">so i agree with that to an extent okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">my real point is that there is tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">that exists</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">in this well right in the well</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.520" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">there&#39;s normal tribalism you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:40:58.000" style="s2">elephants and donkeys under the best of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s not inherently bad right what</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">you have is a tension between</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">arguments right those who want</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">less meddling and more freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">therefore are willing to tolerate more</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">failure</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">more people falling off the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.440" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">the ladder or something our intention</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">with those</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">who um want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">that bad things don&#39;t befall you and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">they will actually remove too much of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">the incentive for you to do good things</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">right so those two things are actual</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">arguments</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">right and where we are is something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:32.720" style="s2">reasonable people can disagree over and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">where we should want to be is some place</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.720" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">reasonable people can disagree over</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">my point is that those unstable</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">equilibria the two high points from</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">which you descend into madness</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">are places where there is no argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">what we effectively start doing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">teaming up</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">for violence and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">this is the thing that i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">about is that history has some</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">mechanism as far as i know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">have a name right we might have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">description of it when things descend</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">marxism we might have a description of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">it when things descend into fascism</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">as far as i know we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">description for the general pattern</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">of a functional society that is ebbing</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">and flowing</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:15.119" style="s2">has hit a tipping point and that tipping</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">point goes to this other type of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.119" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">behavior and that other type of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">ends in</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">warfare genocide all of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i&#39;m hunting for is i</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">think we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">we are now watching and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">people that we are in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">are now grappling with how to describe</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">what they are seeing we are debating</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">over stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">that literally i mean you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">been at are we really arguing about</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">whether males and females</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">are different at a biological level like</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">how could a conversation ever get that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">dumb</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s inconceivable we&#39;re now doing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">with two plus two equals five</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">right is it possible the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">will ever get that dumb yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">it actually apparently is that dumb i</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">will say that my own failure of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">cannot figure out what gets dumber than</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to get done i&#39;m waiting but my</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">you have hit bottom we have hit bottom</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">on something</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">and that is the degree to which what we</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">are arguing over has</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">anything to do with an analysis of any</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">at the point you are arguing about two</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">plus two equals five you are declaring</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">that you no longer care</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">about what is actual right um</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">it&#39;s pure solipsism and so my point is</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">pure solipsism</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">is the adult version of stars on your</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">bellies</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">so to those who would say but the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">side is fascism</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">anything is better than that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">matter as much</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">maybe that we say you know what i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">even think that&#39;s fascism</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">it what matters more is actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">intellectual solipsism</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">is the end full stop like that that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">where you lose</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">all access to the gains from the last</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">300 years right</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">so this is this is the point about</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">autoimmunity</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">is that the people who are arguing</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">against logic itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">right and those who have signed up with</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">them and are making excuses for them</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">are arguing against what we have in</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:10.560" style="s2">favor of something</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">they claim we could have now my point</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.560" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">every single test of their intuition</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">about what we could have</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.599" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">descends into madness almost instantly</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">so we are listening to insane people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">have a claim about a world better than</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">this one</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">and we are no longer listening to people</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">who say this world has a hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">going for it</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">and the only right thing to do is to fix</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">the parts that didn&#39;t get there</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">to complete the project rather than</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">destroy the project we are in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.560" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">and we are losing ground to the people</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">who want to destroy this world in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">hope or in the expectation that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">something marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">as they see it will arise in its place</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">the only uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">we are losing ground because their</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">argument is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">an argument it is a threat</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">expand on that a little bit we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">losing ground ah we are losing ground</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it it all sounded to er to all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">us like we were in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">and then it turns out no actually what</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">was maybe thinly veiled</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.560" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">is now just full-on threat yes and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">the way that this looks</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m beginning to get frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">with our circle because our circle is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">seeing so much</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">of this nonsense that it is just it</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">thinks its job is to catalog it have you</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">seen this crazy example have you seen</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">that crazy example look at what this</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">person claimed</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.359" style="s2">oh my god it&#39;s gotten even worse right</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">and my point is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.359" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">that that will work for some people</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t yet seen it being</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">being presented with a list a catalog um</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">i feel a little like invoking yoda and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:47.599" style="s2">i&#39;m not a huge star wars fan but i am</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:50.800" style="s2">kind of a huge yoda fan</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.599" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">um there is no try there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.800" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">do and don&#39;t do right my point is</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:59.119" style="s2">our circle being fascinated by all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">the various examples</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.119" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">is missing the boat because we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">to lose the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">feeding us that will provide our</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">descendants with the place to exist and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">experience freedom and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">things and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">the reason we are losing it is because</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">you know those who are good</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">at analysis default to it when something</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">comes in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">form we are purely being gaslit</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">right the argument two plus two equals</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">five is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">purely gaslighting now i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">that everybody who&#39;s saying it knows</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">but i am saying that its function is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">take all of the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">who feel like no wait a minute let me</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">explain to you why 2 plus 2 does not</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">equal</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">5 and get them explaining it because</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">they&#39;re busy over here not paying</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">right we are not paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">real thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">holy shit i think we just crossed that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">threshold</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">that takes a functional entity and turns</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">it into madness</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.359" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">and the other thing if i can just put</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">the last piece in the puzzle as i see it</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">i think we need to stop saying that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">marxism doesn&#39;t work i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">whole lot we can talk about here</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">because not work isn&#39;t really the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s that when it works it is completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">unacceptable from the point of view</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">of what actually makes sense to value as</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">a human being</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">in other words being existing</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">as a homo sapiens is not the valuable</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">right the valuable thing has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:34.400" style="s2">your ability to take the specialness</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">that comes along with being a homo</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">and apply it to things that seem</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:46.319" style="s2">so you know does north korea work</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">it it does i don&#39;t want to live like</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.319" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">in fact i would gladly i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:53.359" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have to define work then</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">well it persists</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.359" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">oh well mass famine and and mass deaths</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">and such</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">yeah but but the point is the entity</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">persists and we could say the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">about china in fact entity the political</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:07.839" style="s2">entity</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">persists and the population even though</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.839" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">many individuals are lost along the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">in perfectly grotesque circumstances it</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">it it does look like it&#39;s sticking</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">around and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">china is not just sticking around china</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">is actually thriving economically and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">with respect to its</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:31.280" style="s2">global power and so the point is well</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">china&#39;s also moved into more of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">capitalist model sure but my point is</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:38.480" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to make the argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">that won&#39;t work then china actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.480" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">tells you well that&#39;s not quite right</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">because whatever it thought it was doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">moved into something that made it</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">quickly powerful and ascendant</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">i still don&#39;t want to live under that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">system and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">at some level a communism often does</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">fail</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.079" style="s2">b when it succeeds it never does so</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.079" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">totalitarianism in tow for reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve described here</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">that because it is group selection</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">to imagine that people will behave</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">altruistically the way that a communist</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">system that functions works</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">is by realigning people&#39;s incentives by</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">threatening them</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">so you know the gulags come along with</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">functional communism and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">this so but just to put this in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">language that we&#39;ve often used</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">elsewhere communism assumes that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">external motivation</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">is the thing that is needed to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">people to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">the right thing and then and the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">is then uh is</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">decided by defined by the state and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">and the external motivator is almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:46.960" style="s2">entirely stick no carrot</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">and we are not arguing that we should</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">have a carrot-based totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">argument but rather</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">figure out a way to allow people to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">know themselves well enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:59.440" style="s2">to motivate themselves internally to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:01.359" style="s2">produce and create and discover</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.440" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">and heal and do all of the other things</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">that humans do when we are at our best</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">rather than creating a system that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:08.400" style="s2">requires external motivators especially</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">in the form of the state</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">or corporations to impart on people what</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">it is that they should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">right or if i could put it a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:18.800" style="s2">way and you know on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">folks on the right thinking folks on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.800" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">right love to hear an analysis about why</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">communism does tend to come with</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">authoritarianism right</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for that argument and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s important to them but they over</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">apply it</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">so what i would argue is that our system</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">functions best</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">as a hybrid and it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">surprising that it functions best as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">hybrid this is a natural outgrowth</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">of thinking about complex systems and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:49.520" style="s2">right any pure system has massive</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">failures associated with it because if</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.520" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">you maximize one thing you crash all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">other values</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:55.680" style="s2">that means that a good system will</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">involve</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.680" end="00:50:59.599" style="s2">getting 85 of some value but not seeking</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.599" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">and then you can have 85 percent of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">lot of things right so that principle</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:07.839" style="s2">is important which is why i think people</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.359" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">actually get the question of socialism</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.839" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">wrong because their senses</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">well socialism is communism okay and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s an argument that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:17.280" style="s2">their flavors are the same thing um and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:19.440" style="s2">that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:20.319" style="s2">anybody who has those inclinations is</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.319" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">inviting gulags which is not the case</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">because it can certainly be true if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">my little trough model here we can say</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">that actually there are times</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have enough socialism to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:34.559" style="s2">make your system work you&#39;re coming too</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">close to one of these maximization</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.559" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">places so you need more socialism does</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">that mean you&#39;re a socialist</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:41.680" style="s2">no you need to pool enough of the risks</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">to guarantee that the people really at</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.680" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">don&#39;t fall off entirely</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">right right so what yeah what we really</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">need is a system</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">that leverages the great part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:55.280" style="s2">which is markets being applied to</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">problems that markets are good at</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.280" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">solving</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">while hedging out the bad parts that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">allow people to discover</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2">their internal motivations and act on it</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">and benefit from doing so</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">when it is in the service of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">society hell yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">we want you to get paid handsomely</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.000" end="00:52:13.280" style="s2">when you deliver something that improves</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:15.040" style="s2">our lives a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.280" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">right we want that to be the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:17.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s the mythology of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">and again</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.680" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">there are so many roots there it could</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">be discovery which is typically</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:25.839" style="s2">uh what what stem people are doing you</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.920" end="00:52:27.920" style="s2">know scientists and such and it could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.839" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">creation which may be more often in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.920" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">realm of art and literature</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">and and entertainment it could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">healing it could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">so many things it could be um production</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">it could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">you know organizing of those parts in</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">order to create an emergent hole that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.640" style="s2">greater than this than the individual</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">parts there are many many ways to</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.640" end="00:52:50.640" style="s2">actually add value right but you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">you need to discover on your own what</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.640" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">individual talents and proclivities and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">passions are</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">and learn how to and you know for this</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">we need a system that doesn&#39;t destroy</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">children in school and doesn&#39;t drug them</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t feed them screens it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">tell parents they need to keep all risk</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:08.400" style="s2">from children all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">such that by the time people in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.400" end="00:53:12.559" style="s2">bodies of children become people in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">bodies of adults they&#39;re actually adults</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.559" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">as opposed to still acting like</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">unregulated</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">unable to be regulated six-year-olds</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">totally so i think that this is really</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">it&#39;s tragic that we&#39;re figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">to phrase this at the point we are</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">arriving at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">possible uninvention of everything but</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:38.720" style="s2">that the purpose of the protective</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">programs is actually to protect your</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:42.079" style="s2">ability to innovate so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">deliver value which gets paid</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.079" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">back in a market is really i think the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">right answer</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">and you can see how this works i mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">obvious the fact is you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">protected from</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">failures that are not signal</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.480" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">right if you&#39;re innovating in the market</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">you want your failures that you could</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.079" end="00:54:02.640" style="s2">have foreseen</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">to haunt you a bit so that you get</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">better at figuring out where the real</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">value is</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">but you don&#39;t want arbitrary stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">take you down so you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">you know except people do want their</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">good luck to raise them up</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">i mean this this is this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">right that noise luck is noise</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">and people attribute their success that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:21.359" style="s2">was in fact a good lock to their own</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">skill</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.359" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">and they tend to attribute uh their</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">failures that was in fact bad luck to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:27.920" style="s2">bad luck</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:29.119" style="s2">and if we are going to try to even out</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.920" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">the effects of noise it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.119" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">flatten out both the good and the bad</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">luck right we do not want to flatten out</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:38.079" style="s2">excellent choices and excellent skills</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">and poor choices and poor skills</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.079" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">but you know you can think of it like um</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">a tennis court right a really good</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:47.760" style="s2">tennis court is one in which the luck</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.760" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">as eliminated as much as possible that</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">is to say the surface is</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">perfectly even so nobody is benefiting</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.119" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">from a clump of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">grass that causes a ball to take a bad</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">hop</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">you know the fact is some of the bad</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:02.799" style="s2">hops would go against your opponent hey</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">yay some of the bad hops would go</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.799" end="00:55:05.599" style="s2">against you god damn it that thing was</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">in the way i would have gotten the ball</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:08.079" style="s2">if it hadn&#39;t been there</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">well there&#39;s something sorry but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.079" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">something interesting to be thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">about here with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">you know players who you know every</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">every player in tennis has a preference</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">right hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">grass or clay and they&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">varied like grass has got to be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:23.359" style="s2">noisiest of those surfaces i would think</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">although it&#39;s possible that clay</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.359" end="00:55:26.960" style="s2">also the longer you play on clay the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">longer you play on grass the more it</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">changes whereas hard surface is going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">remain entirely the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">throughout the game throughout a</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:35.280" style="s2">competition anyway but</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">something i keep saying that people are</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.280" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">scratching their heads over is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:41.280" style="s2">bad luck you&#39;re never going to hedge it</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">out but it&#39;s got to be randomly</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.280" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">distributed because if it isn&#39;t randomly</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">distributed it&#39;s not luck it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">right so you know it&#39;s one thing if</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">they&#39;re imperfections on both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.200" style="s2">the court and you both accept that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">game is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.200" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">you know the game is gonna be less good</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">at figuring out who the better player is</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">it may go one way or the other because</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:00.720" style="s2">of something that was luck but</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t go in favor of one player</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.720" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">the luck shouldn&#39;t be you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:06.880" style="s2">venus williams and not serena it should</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">have to time be one and half the time be</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.880" end="00:56:08.640" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">and just i mean to continue with tennis</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.640" end="00:56:12.079" style="s2">this is part of why you switch sides</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.559" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about sun angle and such</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.079" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">but exactly</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">so the point is a really good game is</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">one that rand that</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">eliminates as much noise as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">randomizes its distribution so that what</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">you actually get is athletic prowess and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">the thing is our market should be like</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">this too</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.680" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">you don&#39;t want the fact that you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:30.559" style="s2">innovating</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">the next big thing you know you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.559" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">innovating uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">some sort of i don&#39;t know safety</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">mechanism or</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.319" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">fusion reactor that would free us from</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">energetic constraints and</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">then you got cancer and you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:45.520" style="s2">afford you know to fight it so</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">it wiped out your research program right</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.520" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">you want a system that basically leaves</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">positive incentives in the market right</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">and eliminates</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:56:57.920" style="s2">the luck aspect and what&#39;s more if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">can go back to your example about kids</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.920" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">and what they face</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">you do not want people innovating</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">badness</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve never ever heard a</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">proper argument that defends advertising</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">to children</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">to me advertising to children is an evil</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">i have asked people to give me any</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:20.079" style="s2">valid argument in favor of allowing it</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">to exist i&#39;ve yet to hear one that i</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.079" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">found even a little bit compelling</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">and the basic point is look in childhood</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:27.920" style="s2">you should be protected from</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">economic forces that are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">persuade you of stuff for their good</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">that probably isn&#39;t in your interest and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.200" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">this is a corruption so you know do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">want to be able to innovate anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">no i don&#39;t want you innovating sorry</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">mechanisms to get inside my kids head</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:44.000" style="s2">and get them to</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">spend money they wouldn&#39;t spend or</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.000" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">demand things i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">that i want there to be regulations that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">prevent that right and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">good regulation is regulation that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">leaves the market to do things we want</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:57.839" style="s2">done and doesn&#39;t allow it where</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">it accomplishes things that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.839" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">want done like um</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">and those and what&#39;s in each of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">buckets is what we should be spending</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">our time</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">arguing about right yeah right rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">than whether</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">it is possible that two plus two equals</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">four is a white people thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:17.599" style="s2">yeah so um i we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:19.440" style="s2">we&#39;re closing out an hour here and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.599" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">think i will save</p>

<p begin="00:58:28.160" end="00:58:30.640" style="s2">that i think is actually very much in</p>

<p begin="01:03:58.720" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">human performance this is slightly weird</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">to be doing here because we are</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">disembodied from those watching and from</p>

<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:11.760" style="s2">but you know we&#39;re here embodied with</p>

<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:19.119" style="s2">make it happen during this season we are</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">going outside taking walks or bike rides</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">or getting our</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:25.680" style="s2">kayaks into the water and just being</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:27.599" style="s2">there in our bodies with our brands with</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:30.400" style="s2">each other and our children</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.599" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">and it is fundamentally different and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.400" end="01:04:32.960" style="s2">being out there you know when you guys</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.760" end="01:04:34.400" style="s2">were pulling the boats out of the water</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.960" end="01:04:37.280" style="s2">a few nights ago</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.400" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">and i was just sitting watching first</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.280" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">the geese but then the other people on</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:43.119" style="s2">the dock we were too far away to see</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">them directly it was too dark to make</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.119" end="01:04:45.760" style="s2">eye contact</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:47.359" style="s2">but they were there and we were there</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.760" end="01:04:49.760" style="s2">and we were all there together in a way</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.359" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t tend to happen anymore</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.760" end="01:04:53.680" style="s2">yeah i agree and there was an awful lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:55.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.680" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">what i would say is superficial</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.200" end="01:04:58.880" style="s2">camaraderie that</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:05:00.240" style="s2">used to be exchanged just the simple</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:01.599" style="s2">fact that you were</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.240" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">involved in the same activity as</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.599" end="01:05:04.720" style="s2">somebody you know you would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.720" end="01:05:08.319" style="s2">how nice an evening it was for it or</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">whatever yeah and a lot of that has been</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.319" end="01:05:11.200" style="s2">lost and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">i must say when it does happen it feels</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.200" end="01:05:14.079" style="s2">really really good it feels such a</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">relief feels human</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.079" end="01:05:18.720" style="s2">right it feels like a reminder of what</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">we are that we are social beings that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.720" end="01:05:21.839" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:23.440" style="s2">just our brains we are not brains in</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.839" end="01:05:24.960" style="s2">jars we are and we are not just our</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.440" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">bodies so when we go out and actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.960" end="01:05:28.400" style="s2">engage in</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:30.319" style="s2">sport or physical activity it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.400" end="01:05:31.359" style="s2">now we put our analytical selves on hold</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.319" end="01:05:33.359" style="s2">our creative selves</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.359" end="01:05:35.039" style="s2">know like this is this is often the</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.359" end="01:05:36.880" style="s2">place where the best ideas come from</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.039" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">right when you are not actively working</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.880" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:40.880" style="s2">an intellectual puzzle or how to word</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.799" end="01:05:43.039" style="s2">the thing it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.880" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">this place where you can you know be in</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.039" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">the moment fully</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:49.119" style="s2">well and it is it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:52.319" style="s2">demonstration of exactly</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.119" end="01:05:55.440" style="s2">um the thing that is lost</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.319" end="01:05:56.880" style="s2">in this de-individuated communal view</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.440" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">which is not to say that there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.880" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">lot about what works that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:01.280" style="s2">communal but</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">the point is it&#39;s semi-communal the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.280" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">thing that&#39;s great about communal is</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:07.520" style="s2">the asymmetry of it that different</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:09.359" style="s2">people with different perspectives find</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.520" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">themselves in the same space</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.359" end="01:06:12.960" style="s2">and you know it just if you erase that</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:15.119" style="s2">by either</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.960" end="01:06:17.119" style="s2">forcing everybody to be alike or</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.119" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">policing what they say so that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.119" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">differences can&#39;t be seen</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">you just destroy such a large fraction</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:25.200" style="s2">of what&#39;s important about</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.240" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">the humanness of it that&#39;s right and but</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.200" end="01:06:29.359" style="s2">anyway i would also say just</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">on a bright note it is totally true that</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">many of these technologies just</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.920" style="s2">obliterate some important social</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">interaction that once existed</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.920" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">but then others are arbitrarily created</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:42.240" style="s2">so this</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.200" end="01:06:44.960" style="s2">podcast is obviously you all</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.240" end="01:06:46.079" style="s2">choosing to tune in a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.960" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">between us that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.079" end="01:06:49.440" style="s2">exactly a conversation between us</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">because we&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.440" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s an audience and this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">specifically something we do</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">here so that you can tune it in but</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">we&#39;re also not</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:00.400" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s a total fabrication no</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:02.160" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious obviously</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.400" end="01:07:03.760" style="s2">obviously we have conversations like</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">this elsewhere and have been for</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.760" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">decades else we wouldn&#39;t have been able</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">to show up on camera and start talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:11.839" style="s2">right so the conversation is real</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:13.200" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing inauthentic about it you</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.839" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">all know what you&#39;ve signed up for we</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.200" end="01:07:15.599" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">why we&#39;re sitting here but the point is</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.599" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">it is a choice and it is a semi-social</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">choice because</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:22.319" style="s2">although we&#39;re not interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:24.160" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s paying attention we get</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">a lot of information back about what</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:27.839" style="s2">people are thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">and we get lots of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.839" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">communications that point our attention</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">to things</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:36.400" style="s2">so anyway this is some new form right</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:38.400" style="s2">it is and it it&#39;s uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.400" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s hopeful that even as certain things</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.400" end="01:07:42.640" style="s2">are being destroyed other things are</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.400" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">wrestling their way into existence that</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.640" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">uh in some ways compensate for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">been lost</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">yeah may they continue into the future</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">indeed</p>

<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">the point</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:08:57.759" style="s2">very gratifying</p>
