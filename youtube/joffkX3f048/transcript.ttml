<p begin="00:00:03.300" end="00:00:08.250" style="s2">give an update to all of my patreon</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:10.200" style="s2">supporters to let you know a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.250" end="00:00:11.969" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing with the Center for</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:14.009" style="s2">Applied cultural evolution that we just</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">launched because this is really what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.009" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">are supporting um just you know between</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:21.180" style="s2">us the only funding that this</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">organization has right now is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.180" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">funding you are providing so quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">literally you are making this happen and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">so I wanted to give you a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">updates as you may know we have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">website we launched it about two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:33.570" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">we&#39;ve already got a few hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.570" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">following us on Twitter more than three</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">hundred people following us on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:41.579" style="s2">about 160 people signed up on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:44.910" style="s2">newsletter and so we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.579" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">build a modest audience around this but</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:49.140" style="s2">what I think is really exciting is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">having some great conversations with a</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:56.489" style="s2">in Brazil and in Chile about creating</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">what we&#39;re calling the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.489" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">evolution toolkit and this is meant to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">be a curriculum of tools and frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">for helping people who are trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:12.110" style="s2">changemakers to learn how to develop</p>

<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">to make themselves more effective as</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.710" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">people trying to create change and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">giving them tools and frameworks for</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:26.759" style="s2">understanding the system-level</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">complexities of what happens in the</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">there is really powerful tools and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">social science research that reveals</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">some of these structures these</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:42.530" style="s2">mechanisms and patterns that aren&#39;t into</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">it over obvious so by having vetted</p>

<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">the same time I have all started a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">conversation with a blog post on medium</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">that I wrote last week about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">universities becoming learning platforms</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:03.829" style="s2">for bio regional resilience so the basic</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">idea here is that all over the planet</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.829" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">changes happening so quickly that most</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:09.880" style="s2">communities are going to be disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:11.800" style="s2">and negative</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.880" end="00:02:14.520" style="s2">whether it&#39;s by environmental issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.800" end="00:02:17.530" style="s2">like droughts and wildfires and floods</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.520" end="00:02:19.240" style="s2">sea level rises if the the communities</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.530" end="00:02:22.090" style="s2">are on the coasts of the world&#39;s oceans</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.240" end="00:02:24.820" style="s2">or if it&#39;s more of a social disarray</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.090" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">because of tribalism and fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.820" end="00:02:29.860" style="s2">political confrontations the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:32.470" style="s2">cooperation and Trust or you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.860" end="00:02:34.870" style="s2">things that come out of the drivers of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.470" end="00:02:36.010" style="s2">inequality they&#39;re there a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.870" end="00:02:39.130" style="s2">things like this that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.010" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">affect communities and what what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.130" end="00:02:44.200" style="s2">really see as being important is for</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:47.350" style="s2">there to be a meshwork of people and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.200" end="00:02:49.989" style="s2">organizations within communities that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.350" end="00:02:51.700" style="s2">are increasingly connected into feedback</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.989" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2">loops of learning with the environments</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.700" end="00:02:56.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re embedded in but also not</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">just the environments as in nature but</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.200" end="00:03:00.160" style="s2">the environments as in the social</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.870" style="s2">environments what are the worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.160" end="00:03:04.660" style="s2">that people have the values that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.870" end="00:03:06.300" style="s2">act on the social norms that shape what</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.660" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">is considered acceptable or unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.300" end="00:03:11.470" style="s2">behavior the structures and institutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:13.870" style="s2">the business practices the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.470" end="00:03:17.170" style="s2">policies are formed the the modes or</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.870" end="00:03:19.810" style="s2">methods of cooperation there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.170" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">different ways that communities might do</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.810" end="00:03:23.890" style="s2">things so it&#39;s going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:25.690" style="s2">important for people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.890" end="00:03:27.340" style="s2">different parts of the world to know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.690" end="00:03:30.160" style="s2">to manage what&#39;s going on in their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.340" end="00:03:31.450" style="s2">backyards at the same time they need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.160" end="00:03:33.430" style="s2">be able to work at a large enough scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.450" end="00:03:35.739" style="s2">and this is why I&#39;ve picked the scale of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.430" end="00:03:37.989" style="s2">the bioregion to be able to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.739" end="00:03:40.299" style="s2">their efforts with bioregions in other</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.989" end="00:03:43.239" style="s2">parts of the world to try to cheer jeev</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.299" end="00:03:46.330" style="s2">global goals so we already know about</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.239" end="00:03:48.370" style="s2">carbon dioxide levels that are the focus</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.330" end="00:03:50.489" style="s2">of climate policies but there are also</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.370" end="00:03:52.930" style="s2">things like stopping deforestation</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.489" end="00:03:55.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a really disturbing study that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.930" end="00:03:57.580" style="s2">just came out suggesting that if 3</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.060" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">percent more of the Amazon rainforest is</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.580" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">cut down that the ability of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:05.500" style="s2">forest ecosystem to fuel its pumping</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:07.390" style="s2">process of bringing in moisture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.500" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">replenishing itself then basically that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.390" end="00:04:13.959" style="s2">engine of thermodynamics and an energy</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:15.579" style="s2">transfer may collapse and unravel which</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.959" end="00:04:17.470" style="s2">would have catastrophic effects globally</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.579" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">so there are similar things happening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.470" end="00:04:22.730" style="s2">other parts of the world what this means</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:24.680" style="s2">is that we need to create really</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.730" end="00:04:26.330" style="s2">learning environments the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.680" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">I make in that paper is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.330" end="00:04:30.410" style="s2">universities happen to be located in</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:32.600" style="s2">population centers they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.410" end="00:04:35.420" style="s2">located in cities and so they can work</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.600" end="00:04:37.310" style="s2">as partners with increasing depth of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.420" end="00:04:39.380" style="s2">relationship with the cities they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.310" end="00:04:42.140" style="s2">bedlam and the larger regions of cities</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.380" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">are part of so this is just two ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.140" end="00:04:47.330" style="s2">that you know right out of the gate as</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:49.190" style="s2">we launched this research Center we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.330" end="00:04:50.900" style="s2">doing things to try to help so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.190" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">creating curriculum materials that will</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.900" end="00:04:57.430" style="s2">be shared with change makers around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:59.510" style="s2">world starting in Latin America with</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.430" end="00:05:01.400" style="s2">things being written in English but</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.510" end="00:05:03.920" style="s2">immediately translated into Spanish in</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.400" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">French or Spanish and Portuguese with</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.920" end="00:05:08.060" style="s2">plans to expand and expand that to other</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:09.340" style="s2">languages later but also starting to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:12.470" style="s2">build a conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.340" end="00:05:14.480" style="s2">cross-cutting themes like the future of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.470" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">universities the relationships to cities</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.480" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">and the bio regions to start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:20.120" style="s2">stimulate discussion about the visionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:21.410" style="s2">things we need to do so they sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.120" end="00:05:22.730" style="s2">few things that we have going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.410" end="00:05:24.650" style="s2">background that you are funding and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.730" end="00:05:27.080" style="s2">making possible and I just want to thank</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.650" end="00:05:29.060" style="s2">you for your support and really tell you</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.080" end="00:05:31.610" style="s2">that we literally could not do this</p>
