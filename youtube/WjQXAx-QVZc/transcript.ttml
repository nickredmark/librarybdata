<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">and parishes and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">and some actually got into the guerrilla</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:14.959" style="s2">but i was a friend you see so and and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">coincided in the kind of vision we had</p>

<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">and and in those times for more</p>

<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">and um but it happened to be that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">uh some went through violence and some</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">stayed more in the peaceful you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">parts in my case i was much more engaged</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:20.160" style="s2">know because i needed to be consistent</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">with what the law tells you to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.160" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">and uh so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">basically i started during those years</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">this is 1977.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">it started wondering well who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">be protecting</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">the beauty of this perfection that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">of nature with human beings and that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">most incipient sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">an intercourse that i had to devote</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">my my life to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">the earth into everything else</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.879" style="s2">so and that during those times it led me</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.879" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">study environmental law and policy</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">actually abroad</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">and and comparative uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">policies and law and then when i</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">returned back</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">to democracy in argentina in 1982</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">we started an organization</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">a local organization but with a latin</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">commitment and engagement so everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">that we would do</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">would have to create value for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">region</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">so during those terms my personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">uh identity was very much a latin</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">and coming from this was the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">that&#39;s right it&#39;s uh the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">natural resources foundation</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">that we started with uh a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">prestigious</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">uh uh expert on natural resources</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">law and and then from then on</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">we started doing you know the kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">things that actually you know moved me</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">and i was passionate about which was to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">the three axis you know access to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">justice access to decision making and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">access to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">information to environmental</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">rights so that was actually promoted</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">into the different national</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">constitutions and different latin</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:29.680" style="s2">american countries</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">and also practicing you know the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.680" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">way that you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">promote an idea is that once you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">the tool</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">that makes that idea tangible and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">so uh that&#39;s basically that period of my</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">that um well</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">uh and then from that institutional</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">we worked on different environmental</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">regimes it was that generation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">of environmental awareness</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">throughout the region and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">using new mechanisms of law and policy</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">but always practicing</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">them and also you know participating in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">the process towards the earth summit</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">on environment and development i want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">come to that in a sec</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">just just so i understand the the remit</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">of the foundation a bit better</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">it was focused on helping um</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">changes in policy and law and across</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">latin america to include</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">the the conversation about environmental</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">protection</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">and wise resource use in in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">legal system or</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">right during those times and also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">you know um because on the one hand you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">you know the regimes the regimes for say</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">foreign conservation national national</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">parks or</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">or you know species conservation or</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">water quality or air pollution you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">like segments we were all organized by</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">segments during those times</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">you see i mean we all come at least i</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">come from that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">you know the logic of here is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">environment and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">you know social development and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">the economy i hadn&#39;t integrated anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">although intuitively that was what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">wanted</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:18.399" style="s2">you see but i didn&#39;t know how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">so i would just focus</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.399" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">on you know very concrete lineal</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">responses</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">to concrete problems you see so and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">and my responses always done with others</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">was uh you know through legal</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">uh instruments and regimes now some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">like you know the three the three prince</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">the principles of access you know access</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">to justice access to information and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">access to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">uh decision making we knew at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">that anyone would like to use them for</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">their own purposes</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">so gradually we started interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">that had other causes like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">poverty uh uh gender equality</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">and and you know indigenous rights and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">and gradually we started noticing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:14.959" style="s2">really liked the idea of using exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">the same mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">were being in institutionalized and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">implemented</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">because of environmental aims see</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">so so it was very interesting and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">led me</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">of course personally to start</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">empathizing with the causes of others</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">these were all beautiful people they</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">were all you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">fighting for for you know a better world</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">uh but i had no clue and during those</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">i was very much a professional you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">i had a discipline my self</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">was to know about the content</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">of a discipline i knew the scope of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">discipline</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">i would specialize i would you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">i would build my professional prestige</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">and reputation</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">based on my knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">i would read books and i would write</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">that was me during those times and um</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">and i was you know i was recognized by</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">others and people would</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">and so on and so you that then probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">led to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">you being invited to um pulling together</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">the latin american um collaboration</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">proposing the activity so we started</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">actually coming up with initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:13.120" style="s2">and we started clustering the different</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">which was a civil society initiative</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:23.199" style="s2">we were not called by the u.n for</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.199" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">but once you start doing that as we all</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">once you start calling all the parties</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">uh then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">and also the governments the local</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">governments the national government</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">then of course the next you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">uh grouping or the intergovernmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">organization so we start</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">you know working with them so with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">bruntland commission with</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">uh there was a man called maurice strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">and the person who was in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">uh thus the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">of the u.n summit with</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">civil society was yolanda kakabazi</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">and and then she was named the u.n under</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.040" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">secretary</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">natural evolution because we started</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">to work on the preparations uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">well way back i can&#39;t remember exactly</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">important to say it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">one of the civil society processes that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">fed into the earth summit you see so</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">and the the celebration of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">governments we had the support of uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">scandinavian governments in fact</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">but then the then brazilian government</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">and uh so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">everything sort of you know was a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">and um so it was a good experience but</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">that experience in my personal journey</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">led me definitely to start saying you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">i need to go beyond the discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">beyond the sector</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not i&#39;m not a person that i</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">can fit in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">my own borders so so i</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">realized that i had to go beyond and uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">it was then</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">that we met with with the founder of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">arena</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">foundation stefan schmidhini the swiss</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">and we had them again like one of my</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">most amazing conversations in my life</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">understanding the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">reason for which he was creating uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">the foundation which was very simple he</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">you know the the direction the course</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">on which we are will actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">make humanity you know crash into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">iceberg</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">so he wrote a book called changing</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">and he said we do have the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">to change the course</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">we&#39;re still on time i&#39;m i&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">about 1996</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">yeah now and he said however</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">nobody knows how to now the collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">definitely surely will know</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">and the way to do that is identifying</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">leadership</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">from any domain any field</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s how we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">approach it</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not me a philanthropist that will</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">know what to do it&#39;s not the</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.240" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">uh anticipated the inheritance</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">when i was i think he was 27</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">and uh a kid with all kinds of dreams</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">for a better world</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">um and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">i i read an article</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure in which you know like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">science or one of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">journals about asbestos</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">and i became aware</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">that i could become a mass criminal</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">his decision was to find</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">a solution an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">and he was the man who actually came up</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:06.570" style="s2">alternative technologies and became an</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">and that of course you went to the board</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">of the company with a plan which was not</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:18.400" style="s2">accepted so he said</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.400" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">because i can&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s when he started to sell his</p>

<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">you see gradually it&#39;s a huge it was a</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">conglomerate so</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">and i think that the fact that he was so</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">about his activism against uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">asbestos and creating of course all the</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">that he could think of in the different</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">where the company was i think that has</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">one of the grounds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">why he can be legally accused because he</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">knew</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">although there was no legislation</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">against uh asbestos</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">all the factories were legally</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">and uh he was i mean the company was</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">operating</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">under a legal you know uh legal</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">uh confirmation i mean everything was</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">okay from a legal</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">compliance yeah compliance exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">the world health</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:35.039" style="s2">organization had still during those</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">times you know asbestos as</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.039" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">uh authorized substance so</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">it&#39;s but we all know that legally</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">even if you are legally authorized and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">all the science says it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:56.400" style="s2">if you acknowledge that it&#39;s not fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the legal grounds for</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.400" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">accusations that&#39;s interesting because i</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">often wondered what was the the actual</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">legal loophole that that put him into</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">this position where</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">because he was also doing very good work</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">here on majorca and supporting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">european</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">activities in the environmental area but</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">there was this time when when he</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">literally had to flee um</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:20.559" style="s2">europe in order not to get um</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">incarcerated</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">well he actually did not flee from</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">europe he actually lives in switzerland</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">and the swiss government uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">actually understands his case and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">protects him legally</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">so um but this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">cases that if succeeds</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">it will be a terrible case for other</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">people in the world that suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">that what they&#39;re doing is not good for</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">the planet</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">and for people if they actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">become activists of the change</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">of their own you know uh yeah their own</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">make amends of their own mistakes that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">they did right no</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">they become exactly persecuted so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">happened to me when i</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.320" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">of course there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">businesses but what i</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">did understand was the potential of</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">business leadership not only</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">implementing that leadership for change</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">within the companies but to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">that example to the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">and so it was my very first moment in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">that i had a grasp of uh intuition</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">that perhaps markets the market dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">could change if business would evolve</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">through their leadership of course at</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">the beginning during those times i was</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">still with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">individual leaders you know i could see</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">someone like stefan as</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">my leader you see but of course then i</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">started you know evolving towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">collective leadership</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">thanks to the practice in arena and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">gradually you start you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">then you start evolving and and today i</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">would say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">every human being could be a leader a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">leader</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">bringing their you know singular</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">singular originality to the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:55.520" style="s2">and then you expand that and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">i feel that we need an economy and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.520" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.559" end="00:30:00.799" style="s2">that enables people to expand in and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">flourish into all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.799" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">their dimensions and whenever i see</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">you know constrained from being a leader</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">for society</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">regardless their ideas regardless the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">then i feel the entire society is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">missing</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">an opportunity and the planet as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">because humans are part of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">resonating</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">uh living beings uh of life</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">so so when when you helped to set up</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:34.080" style="s2">arena</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">for latin america and then in different</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.080" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">latin american countries from from</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">there on did arena just enabled lots of</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">environmental</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:45.279" style="s2">projects environmental protection</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">projects through funding or</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.279" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">what was the the models operandi um</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">no it wasn&#39;t i mean no no no</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">aveda was not only about environmental</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">social it was uh human rights it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">any domain of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">see and it was basically trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">connect all the dimensions what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">refer to as the uh triple impact value</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:16.279" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">during those times we would say</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.279" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">intersectorial you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">we would say sustainable development uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">but sustainable development in latin</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">america was not</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:29.519" style="s2">associated and narrowed down only to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.519" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">sustainable development in our language</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">uh the integration our language and our</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">vision in latin america in general was</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">the integration of all the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">and whatever you would do you see so it</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">was social</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">environmental and economically</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">and uh and and politically sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">as well you know and culturally</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">sustainable it was the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">in you know that&#39;s very unique i would</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">say of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">latin american uh cosmic vision</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">um that&#39;s very present so</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">so and how would you achieve that if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">were an environmental leader</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">and you would need a social leader the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">would actually be based on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">mutual admiration of leadership of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">commitment and engagement</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">and then you start cooperating and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">you start integrating by</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">people to people you see so uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">so that was the logic the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">aveeno</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">and uh is that also why because</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">when you started to work with others on</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">creating system away</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">and you you already understood</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">that be corporations by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">only as a few companies trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">things a little bit better or even um</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">improving um wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to cut it and because</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">how how would you distinguish how</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">because in europe we don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">like there&#39;s a pretty strong b corp</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">but um the systemic approach</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">apart from a few grassroots landing</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">points like nessie in</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">in in spain um hasn&#39;t really landed yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">the vision that i understand you hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:28.159" style="s2">with systemabe</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">to work with lawyers to work in policy</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.159" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">to work with business to work with civil</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">society to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">to literally create the human</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">connections that human</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">mutual recognition you just spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">that should business as usual fail which</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">we both know</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">it will or already is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">an infrastructure of predominantly human</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">trust that can buffer</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">the collapse of a system that no longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">serves is is that right</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very correct um although what</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">happened was that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:11.919" style="s2">2009 was a very uh um</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">because i started realizing the scale of</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">in which we were that same year</p>

<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">and i started feeling well</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:59.119" style="s2">where are we going to speak about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">common general good for humanity and the</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">about negotiating who&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">seeding uh confronted with whom china</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">india anyway i started feeling</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">the lack of a space</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">that would give me the trust to say this</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:22.079" style="s2">is what we work</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">for the common good of all humanity and</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">and for a few years or a few months i</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">or a year more or less i started sensing</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">the lack of a space</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">where i would feel if i do this</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be contributing to a</p>

<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">and uh so that was when i started my own</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">second crisis of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">lifetime not that i had a problem with</p>

<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">then suddenly i realized you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">another aha moment business is the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">numerous</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">so i had this flash and so and at that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">moment</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">and how we want to achieve that age</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">of regenerating the forest and the sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">of communities</p>

<p begin="00:38:00.480" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">and that we couldn&#39;t achieve it in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">financially sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">manner through the market so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">market driven</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">solution so started experiencing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">and i decided to become a small</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">shareholder</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">with that act i started experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">a journey of one company</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">so immediately i started calling to my</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">friends all over south america like</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:29.520" style="s2">saying</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">you know others that do regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">regeneration was my response</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">to the trespassing of ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:44.560" style="s2">planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">and and and so so that was my lineal</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">thinking</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">so it comes back and people can still</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">be there and and flourish there so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">was my</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">well that night i went out</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">with people i went back home and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">first thing i did</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">was to write the mail to my emilia</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">correa</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">and that the moment that did the click</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">i received the mail from my career</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">with the same link about b lab and b</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">quotes</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:44.960" style="s2">like saying we need to meet these people</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">i said i&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">met i now know how to do that it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.400" style="s2">that moment</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">and so three months we started</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.400" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">conversations with the founders</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:59.839" style="s2">of b lab and the creators of the b</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:01.680" style="s2">chords and i always say you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.839" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">moment of co-creation</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.680" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">is the most sacred moment that comes</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">multiple multiple energies and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.079" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">experiences and they suddenly become</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">in a new innovation and that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">always celebrate the three founders</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">of avila uh bart houlihan</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:28.000" style="s2">jay cohen and and and andrew kasoy</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">i always celebrate them because thanks</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.000" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">we were able to expand the systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">approach we went to new york we fell in</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">love with them</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">four latin americans and the three u.s</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">we just became like so brothers and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">sisters</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">and we said we&#39;re gonna make it but when</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">we got</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">back to latin america that those</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">following two months we decided that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">create what we call system b not system</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">a but system b</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">why because in latin america we had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">of polarization of lots of divisions</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">left right poor rich who are the ones to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">blame</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">and who are the good guys and we thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">we need to create a new</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">safe space to engage people from</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:27.680" style="s2">all avenues and where we are not</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">stuck with the wording in fact the name</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">comes because of our lack of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">intelligence and inspiration to put</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">a name of what kind of system we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">every word that we found had</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">the baggage of a historical</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">conflict and we said no more let&#39;s put b</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">and if it doesn&#39;t work eventually it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">become c</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:54.240" style="s2">you see but we needed something you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">invite everybody to a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s the reason for which we</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">thought everywhere where we start</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">system b has to start with concrete</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.480" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">you know examples of equals becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">sorry companies becoming big courts</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">because it&#39;s a very concrete way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">prove that business can</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">actually be part of you know large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:25.599" style="s2">and so that&#39;s i would say that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">pillar that&#39;s the the pillar of any</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">system b</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">now say any system b because today you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">have uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:33.119" style="s2">ten national system b&#39;s and then you</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">have one which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.119" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">system b international and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">local b communities</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">at that can be provincial or state</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.720" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">level or can be city wise so</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s quite that&#39;s that&#39;s the logic but</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">everywhere where we start</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">we start with a call because once you</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">have the examples then</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">you start triggering all the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">groups it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">very common for people to say shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">we have to be politicians</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.839" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">or should we have the be lawyers or</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">educators i mean shouldn&#39;t we have the b</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">by understanding the b in the vision of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">what&#39;s in the perception has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">integrated value creation</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">accountability and transparency and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">what value the way you produce value</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">and how you go beyond the share</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:30.480" style="s2">value and how you go beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">shareholder privacy</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.480" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">so the shareholder priority if you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">towards like all groupings and old</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">stakeholders</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">to be able to to balance the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:44.720" style="s2">all the groups</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:45.359" style="s2">right and in the short term in the long</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.720" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.359" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">these elements are appealing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not only appealing to business so</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">what we decided to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">sorry i&#39;m just wondering whether in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">these national</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">sub chapters of systemabe</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">um you start with</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">working with the b corps in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">locality</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">but then this this opening up towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">civil society towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">policymakers towards law how how do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">are all of those 10 national</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">um system away and not just</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">business based but across all three</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">sectors</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">involving um civil society uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">politics governance all that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">it&#39;s very organic you start with</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">an event you know the first vehicle was</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:47.530" style="s2">the one founded by one of the founders</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">of site</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.530" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">uh another one was founded by another of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:56.160" style="s2">the founders</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:57.760" style="s2">another one was also co-founded by</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.760" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">so latte was in chile three sql started</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">chile so so you know we we were the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">generation of b corps in latin america</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">so so we worked with business that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">our first priority</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">because we believed on the on business</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">force for good you see that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">concrete</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">now we knew that the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">lawyers and accountants are the well</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:29.599" style="s2">basically lawyers are</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">because of risk management are the first</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.599" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">to be called by the ceo</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">and by the boards right so we thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">hey let&#39;s share this with a law firm</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">sorry not with the law firm</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">with lawyers and the leaders from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">law firms</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">this is a leadership approach you see</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">so what happened what that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:53.440" style="s2">lawyers started getting passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">this new opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.440" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">of impact law so that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">he started to to see the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">of a now a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">and very successful network of</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">the lawyers it&#39;s called the latin</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">impact lawyers network right</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">and working always globally because</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">situate was</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">born in chile but with the global</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.200" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">aspiration i mean we were suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">realizing that there was something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">we could share with the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">so everything that we would do would</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">uh valid for anywhere in the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">so that was the systems approach right</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">the assist the the six communities i</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:42.160" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">large broad communities that has the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:46.839" style="s2">system being modeled</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">as first the pillar of vehicles then the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.839" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">large market players and these are</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">by and large a large company</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:56.000" style="s2">very large companies the governments in</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">the market</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">uh role and consumer</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">consumer associations large consumer</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">associations</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.760" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">large chunks of interest there</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">then and and as a result of that of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">approach for example this large second</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">category you have large companies</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">walking towards becoming b corps</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">right because the logic is not for all</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:25.280" style="s2">companies to become vehicles the logic</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">is for</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">all companies to conduct their business</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">as if they were be caught you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s trying to move</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">the market in that direction in creating</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">value and solution</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">also another example so now today</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">you have over in latin america you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">over 15 000 companies</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">and you have lots of them experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">either individually or together the what</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">we call</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">camino marie which is a program for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">large company</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">and you also have a program for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">value chain</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">so so or initiatives this is a process</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">of engaging large companies that if they</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">were to try</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">to go through the classic certification</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">process to become a b corp they would</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">definitely fail</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">at their current performance but in</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">order to be able to engage them</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">in the process of learning you&#39;ve opened</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">up that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">that right we&#39;ll walk with you right</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">yeah and and and of course you have this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">first element</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">which is the purpose how to make purpose</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:41.119" style="s2">living energy for the entire market but</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">through the business</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.119" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">the second element has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">measuring</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">and well evaluate assessing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">measuring your</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">your impact in different areas</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">and then the third main element has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">do with expanding your</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">fiduciary liability uh going beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:01.760" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">share shareholder value shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">privacy</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">to all the stakeholder interests what</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">we call today the stakeholder governance</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">this is the state the whole system is</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">the stakeholder governance</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">now with those elements you still can</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.800" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">uh attract many large companies</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">in the direction in that direction i</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">mean the huge the largest companies</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">so um but of course we&#39;re very happy</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">some of these become vehicles like</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">nature was for many years the largest</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">b corp in the world uh now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">uh way in the u.s and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.240" end="00:51:43.440" style="s2">more than 40 percent of its uh sales are</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">under the b</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">corp structure now globally speakers</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:50.319" style="s2">but that i was just referring to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:53.680" style="s2">second uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.319" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">i would say uh community of practice the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.680" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2">large companies that they also meet</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">they help each other they use the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">uh tools of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">assessment once you use the same tool of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:04.400" style="s2">assessment</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">then you start the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">conversations about your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">with the workers your relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:11.359" style="s2">the suppliers with your clients with</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:13.839" style="s2">their communities</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.359" end="00:52:15.520" style="s2">with the the level of governance that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">you have accountabilities</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.520" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">and then you start getting these</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">on board in the market in society</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">you see so so once you have these</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">programs</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">that&#39;s what starts happening now at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">same time you have the governments</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">once these get on board they start</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">realizing</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">that they could also source or they</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">could have</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">procurement regimes that would promote</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">the emergence of this new</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">business identity this new business uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">sector if you want because if you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly the same goals of politics</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:54.800" style="s2">are you know embedded in these companies</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">in the b course</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.800" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">the same higher goals i would say the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">same higher</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">objectives of politics right so suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">you start seeing hey we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">have large-scale solutions through</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">business and the market dynamics because</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">once business starts operating this way</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">then the clients can operate this way</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">and then the suppliers and so on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">investors and the collaborators</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">so you start driving into this move</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">you know many many other players now</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">and and the case is that mendoza was the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">first city that adopted that regime</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">but that regime wasn&#39;t inspired medellin</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">so now in latin america you have two</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">cities that</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">have done the same in terms of uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">developing procurement regimes that</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">uh bet not only benefit but create</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">the market for this kind of business</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">right so so it&#39;s what we call high</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">impact</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">business right is it i mean this was one</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">of the questions i had for you that</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">i certainly find here in europe um like</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:05.280" style="s2">a number of times now i&#39;ve been invited</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">to um sort of business breakfasts or</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.280" end="00:54:08.400" style="s2">business lunches to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">regenerative culture and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.400" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">development and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">of course all these more and more</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">companies are beginning to be very</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:18.079" style="s2">interested in how can i get a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">regenerative um and and become a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.079" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">regenerative company</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">but my personal sense is that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of glass ceiling of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:28.319" style="s2">you can do as a business leader</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">particularly if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.319" end="00:54:31.760" style="s2">run a publicly listed company it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.760" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">for a patagonia or um</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:42.319" style="s2">or guayaqui or those companies or lush</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">or dr bonner and that are also</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.319" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">pretty big companies not as big as these</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">giants but</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">um but because they&#39;re not shareholder</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">obliged</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:53.920" style="s2">in the same way they can make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">much in a much more agile way</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.920" end="00:54:58.319" style="s2">but um like if you look paul pullman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">path with unilever he</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.319" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">he brought up a whole bunch of b-corps</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">as unilever</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">um but eventually he kind of realized</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">that that he wasn&#39;t going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">to transform unilever as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">and that that i i sense that as long as</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:18.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">political regulation playing field and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.839" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">also the current conditions of how we</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">set incentives</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">in markets and how we organize our</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:30.240" style="s2">um aren&#39;t transformed there&#39;s only so</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">much that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.240" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">that even the largest companies could</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">possibly do and certainly smaller</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re absolutely right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">uh although one can still do something</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">to move in that direction so those some</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">things for example the network of</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:52.400" style="s2">in the case of brazil has been working</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">sorry impact lawyers right has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.400" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">working with another of our communities</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">the academic community</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">you know professors that start observing</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">this and start creating from</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">academics you know solutions i know and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">also with</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">um vehicles and also with com</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">large companies listed companies like</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:12.000" style="s2">natura once you have one</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">case then you say it&#39;s true and it can</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.000" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">happen so natura is a listed company</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">that has opened up all the answers to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.319" style="s2">all the questionnaire of the b impact</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">assessment</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.319" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">so so and it&#39;s very moving to see</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">how they present themselves as an with</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">their imperfection</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.040" style="s2">but with their engagement and commitment</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">to improvement</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.040" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">and how they start moving ahead on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:38.920" style="s2">regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:40.960" style="s2">and and they go through different</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.920" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">resatification processes</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.960" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">every three years now what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">in brazil is very interesting with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">stock market</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">the rules of the stock market and the</p>

<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:05.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that it you&#39;re obliged</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.720" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.200" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">become a vehicle but once that&#39;s why for</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.240" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">of the impact measurement</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">uh some people think</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s only to get a certification you</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">know the brand would be with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:29.359" style="s2">with a circle certified uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">benefit corporation but it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.359" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that sorry it means it</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">changes the way people think</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s exactly what buckminster</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">fuller said don&#39;t tell people what to</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">think give them a tool the use of which</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:42.640" style="s2">will change the way they</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">think and by asking people questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.640" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">which is why i have 250 questions in my</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:47.839" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">um you you restructure their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.839" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">you invite them into whole new</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">connections that they previously didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:56.000" style="s2">and so a well-structured questionnaire</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.000" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">so so just imagine if to be to become a</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:04.559" style="s2">listed company in a stock market</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">you have to ask yourself some questions</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.559" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;s very simple and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s very simple it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s witty</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">and and but it&#39;s the kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s the kind of conversations that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">that we normally had outside business we</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:25.119" style="s2">had it in politics in academics in</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">in civil society but we didn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.119" end="00:58:29.119" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">business so that&#39;s why for me that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.119" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">tool</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">the be impact assessment tool</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">which is reviewed you know on a regular</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">basis as well and it&#39;s always improved</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.760" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s always stronger it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">sorry more strict that tool is not</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:46.640" style="s2">only useful for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:49.520" style="s2">certification</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.640" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">it&#39;s useful as a management tool that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.520" end="00:58:52.480" style="s2">helps</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:53.599" style="s2">management to become much more</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.480" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:59:00.079" style="s2">in terms of connecting all the dots</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">to become systemic because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.079" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">pillars of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:09.040" style="s2">is to become systemic and</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">and you know before we</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">associated um business</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">as the most pragmatic because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">not pragmatic you don&#39;t survive</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">yet we come from the lineal pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">how do we evolve from lineal thinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:30.720" style="s2">and practice</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">pragmatism to systemic pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">and and and that&#39;s something that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:35.680" style="s2">appreciate very much from this tool</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">which is socratic</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.680" end="00:59:40.400" style="s2">as you say remember socrates would ask</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:43.359" style="s2">you questions in the market in the aggro</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:44.799" style="s2">not in you know with the acropolis and i</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.359" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">think that&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.799" end="00:59:49.040" style="s2">you see these are the questions where</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:50.799" style="s2">you can interact with the totality</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.040" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">in the market this is where we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.799" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">actually take those questions</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:56.559" style="s2">to the everyday commercial decisions you</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:59.680" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.559" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s a educational tool</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.680" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">a conversational good quality</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">conversational tool</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">and of course you know it&#39;s a management</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:11.599" style="s2">tool and a certification tool</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:12.319" style="s2">you see so so it has many many</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.599" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">attributes</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.319" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">for me at least and those that too</p>

<p begin="01:06:28.559" end="01:06:33.119" style="s2">for that goal so just imagine 2 000</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:36.240" style="s2">volunteers</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.119" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">students at university campuses you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.240" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">communicating the same purpose having a</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">concrete example</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:43.039" style="s2">of how you achieve it through the market</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:43.839" style="s2">and then you have the musicians you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.039" end="01:06:46.160" style="s2">the platform</p>

<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:50.880" style="s2">communicating the same purpose so once</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">you start</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:57.839" style="s2">seeing the extent of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:07:01.119" style="s2">infinite that you can reach out</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.839" end="01:07:04.480" style="s2">just by being a good business</p>

<p begin="01:07:04.480" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">very inspiring for so many other</p>

<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:14.559" style="s2">in the market so that&#39;s why i feel</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.520" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">that if you have the examples</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.559" end="01:07:17.680" style="s2">you catalyze all the other groups you</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:21.039" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.680" end="01:07:22.960" style="s2">all the other groups of a system but if</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.039" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t have the example</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.960" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">it could be very theoretical so</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:29.599" style="s2">just like i shared the example of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">guayaquil</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.599" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">i can also show you the exam many many</p>

<p begin="01:08:32.000" end="01:08:37.839" style="s2">anywhere in the world can be useful</p>

<p begin="01:08:44.159" end="01:08:49.600" style="s2">only got another five minutes left but i</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.319" end="01:08:50.400" style="s2">i&#39;d be interested in in this networked</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.600" end="01:08:53.920" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.400" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">of um obviously</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:58.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t build a system like that in in</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">a relatively short period of time or a</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:03.279" style="s2">network of networks</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:04.239" style="s2">and acros spanning across an entire</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.279" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">subcontinent</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:11.520" style="s2">and beyond into europe and other places</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">um without letting go</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.520" end="01:09:16.319" style="s2">of the notion of having to triple check</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">that every new</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.319" end="01:09:21.359" style="s2">partner that you work with is doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:22.400" style="s2">everything perfectly exactly how you</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.359" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">would do it</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.400" end="01:09:30.480" style="s2">so you need to find very</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">light enabling constraints and basic</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.480" end="01:09:37.600" style="s2">agreements on how to proceed so</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:39.520" style="s2">a new system away in a new country</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.600" end="01:09:42.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t end up being something</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.520" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">completely contradictory to</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">the the mission and how do you achieve</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:49.040" style="s2">that building the trust in the network</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:52.400" style="s2">and rolling</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.040" end="01:09:54.560" style="s2">like expanding the network um and at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.400" end="01:09:56.800" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.560" end="01:09:57.920" style="s2">maintaining some form of quality control</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.800" end="01:09:59.600" style="s2">that what people do</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.920" end="01:10:02.159" style="s2">as you let them go they call you up and</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.600" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">say we&#39;re thinking about starting</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.159" end="01:10:08.480" style="s2">so that is can be cities can be um</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:10.400" style="s2">how do you how do you make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.480" end="01:10:12.159" style="s2">that then is actually something</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.400" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">that that you still feel aligned with</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.159" end="01:10:14.640" style="s2">and that that is aligned with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:16.640" style="s2">impulse</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.640" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">yeah daniel excellent question you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.640" end="01:10:20.880" style="s2">when you start</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">you have mousse but along the way you</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.880" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">start having</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:26.719" style="s2">a legal agreement you see the mlus are</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">self law the legal agreements</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.719" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">are you know you can execute them now</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:32.239" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing which has been again</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">the pillar</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.239" end="01:10:36.159" style="s2">we have a licensing agreement c2a</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:38.719" style="s2">international has a licensing</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.159" end="01:10:39.440" style="s2">agreement with b lab and vehicles are</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.719" end="01:10:42.239" style="s2">vehicles</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.440" end="01:10:44.080" style="s2">you see and and there&#39;s no way benefit</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">corporation the legal status is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.080" end="01:10:48.000" style="s2">benefit corporation throughout the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">so we have something similar called</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.000" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">society beneficiary</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:54.239" style="s2">it&#39;s the same legal language the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.400" end="01:10:56.800" style="s2">legal elements that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.239" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">being pushed so we have agreements with</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.800" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:04.239" style="s2">and uh to be assured that</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">you know we that&#39;s not uh that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.239" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:10.719" style="s2">in its nature regarding system b</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:12.560" style="s2">we all acknowledge that depending on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.719" end="01:11:15.520" style="s2">context he starts</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.560" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">in a different pace you see brazil was</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.520" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">much more</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">proactive with the b corps than the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:21.840" style="s2">large sorry building the b corp</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:23.679" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.840" end="01:11:25.199" style="s2">and especially with the large companies</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.679" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">brazil has huge companies</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.199" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">and they were very successful there uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:32.239" style="s2">other countries started</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:32.719" style="s2">more with smes but they all start with</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.239" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.719" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">and there is a there was an mmu and now</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.960" end="01:11:40.480" style="s2">you start having</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:42.880" style="s2">a much more sophisticated a design of</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.480" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">of agreements legal agreements for these</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.880" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">new movements</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:48.719" style="s2">and uh and and this this is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:50.800" style="s2">a challenge all the time because</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.719" end="01:11:52.640" style="s2">suddenly have an innovation like</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.800" end="01:11:54.800" style="s2">yesterday two days ago</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.640" end="01:11:56.239" style="s2">i was speaking to a group of journalists</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.800" end="01:11:57.360" style="s2">like saying hey we would like to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.239" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">something similar</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.360" end="01:12:01.679" style="s2">with the with a group of building a</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:04.800" style="s2">community of journalists</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.679" end="01:12:07.840" style="s2">from throughout the region to to</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:10.880" style="s2">learn together how to be good</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.840" end="01:12:13.440" style="s2">observance of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.880" end="01:12:14.480" style="s2">i would say the economic tradition</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.440" end="01:12:17.440" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.480" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">you know uh so so called the economic</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.440" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">innovation</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:22.560" style="s2">called the impact economy but you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:24.719" style="s2">they&#39;re not so many</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.560" end="01:12:25.920" style="s2">journalists that have developed the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.719" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">lenses</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.920" end="01:12:30.480" style="s2">to be able to com to understand and</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:32.640" style="s2">communicate this</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.480" end="01:12:34.159" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m speaking about massively</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.640" end="01:12:37.120" style="s2">because the logic is for</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.159" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">any journalist to be able to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.120" end="01:12:40.640" style="s2">this well</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:41.920" style="s2">now the best way of doing it was would</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.640" end="01:12:42.640" style="s2">be with the leadership of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.920" end="01:12:44.880" style="s2">journalists</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.640" end="01:12:46.880" style="s2">so this is happening everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.880" end="01:12:50.000" style="s2">yesterday i was in a webinar</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.880" end="01:12:51.679" style="s2">and someone from mexico said hey we</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.000" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">should do something for the be</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.679" end="01:12:55.280" style="s2">educators at the you know the elementary</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.800" end="01:12:57.120" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.280" end="01:12:59.520" style="s2">and so on but now you&#39;re starting the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.120" end="01:13:02.239" style="s2">community of the bee entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.520" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2">you see so so you start this emerging</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.239" end="01:13:05.360" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.800" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">once you have the systems approach</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.360" end="01:13:11.120" style="s2">what&#39;s beautiful about a system model</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">is that you know that whatever is done</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.120" end="01:13:15.360" style="s2">by one end of the system</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:17.360" style="s2">will benefit the other end and will</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.360" end="01:13:20.560" style="s2">synergize with the other end</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.360" end="01:13:24.400" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s benefiting not only</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.560" end="01:13:27.120" style="s2">for inside the system but it&#39;s together</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.400" end="01:13:27.440" style="s2">for the world and for the planet so you</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.120" end="01:13:30.560" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.440" end="01:13:31.280" style="s2">it&#39;s so the achievements of one part are</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.560" end="01:13:33.199" style="s2">considered</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:34.640" style="s2">the achievements of any of the other</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.199" end="01:13:36.480" style="s2">parts you see</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.640" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s the logic of the systems</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.480" end="01:13:40.640" style="s2">approach and of course</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:42.400" style="s2">once you drive this through trade once</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.640" end="01:13:44.640" style="s2">you have one community here</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.400" end="01:13:45.679" style="s2">they meet with others here they start</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.640" end="01:13:48.000" style="s2">trade</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.679" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s an impact trade and then if</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.000" end="01:13:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s from different countries</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:53.120" style="s2">we start having international impact</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.159" end="01:13:55.920" style="s2">trade</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.120" end="01:13:57.679" style="s2">so so trade agreements have to do with</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.920" end="01:14:00.880" style="s2">creating solutions for the other</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.679" end="01:14:02.960" style="s2">end of the of the trade value chain</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.880" end="01:14:04.080" style="s2">you see and so on and and this goes on</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.960" end="01:14:07.199" style="s2">and on it&#39;s a</p>
