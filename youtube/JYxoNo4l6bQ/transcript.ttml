<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:04.150" style="s2">Charlottesville has a special place in</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.120" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">the National narrative right now for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.150" end="00:01:08.740" style="s2">couple of reasons the most obvious being</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">the you know tragedy that took place</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.740" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">last year</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.420" end="00:01:20.979" style="s2">gonna explain some how I got involved in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.220" end="00:01:23.470" style="s2">all this stuff but today as I was sowing</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.979" end="00:01:29.560" style="s2">into the hotel room I saw that Richard</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.560" end="00:01:34.090" style="s2">today and you know he is going through</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.930" end="00:01:36.250" style="s2">some serious personal drama where he is</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.250" end="00:01:45.069" style="s2">terrible things in the alleging that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.350" end="00:01:46.390" style="s2">he&#39;s like a wife yusor and then alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.069" end="00:01:48.759" style="s2">like getting all these terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.390" end="00:01:50.470" style="s2">and you know I don&#39;t usually take any</p>

<p begin="00:01:50.470" end="00:01:55.780" style="s2">traumas or situations but it did strike</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.770" end="00:02:00.369" style="s2">me as sort of ironic because I have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.780" end="00:02:01.929" style="s2">personal history of rhetoric Spencer but</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.369" end="00:02:03.549" style="s2">he and I have had a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.929" end="00:02:05.830" style="s2">confrontations publicly and he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.549" end="00:02:08.140" style="s2">made his way into my personal life sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.830" end="00:02:10.569" style="s2">of indirectly and for me to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.140" end="00:02:12.069" style="s2">down to Charlottesville at University of</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.069" end="00:02:24.730" style="s2">same time Richard Spencer stars as you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.120" end="00:02:28.840" style="s2">know I can explain a little bit actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">what happened with Richard Richard</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.840" end="00:02:32.380" style="s2">Spencer and all right people thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:33.790" style="s2">that they were sort of a large</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.380" end="00:02:37.349" style="s2">components</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.790" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">the Trump election in 2015 and 2016 and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.349" end="00:02:42.609" style="s2">there were times at which people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">became advocates for Donald Trump got</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.609" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">smeared this all right name myself and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">my friends through this party called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:58.030" style="s2">deplorable a January after the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:03:00.010" style="s2">inauguration and it was a time that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.030" end="00:03:01.659" style="s2">sort of decided that we really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.010" end="00:03:03.909" style="s2">make a definitive statement at all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.659" end="00:03:05.079" style="s2">was not a part of this new movement we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.909" end="00:03:14.079" style="s2">were calling it sort of like the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.079" end="00:03:16.329" style="s2">right there was a separation all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.079" end="00:03:18.669" style="s2">he and all of his buddies were banned</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.329" end="00:03:20.079" style="s2">from coming to the party and there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.669" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">like a thousand people this was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.079" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">incredible event it was a time when all</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:27.189" style="s2">these guys online who had been working</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:29.290" style="s2">so hard and sort of memeing Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.189" end="00:03:32.590" style="s2">into existence all finally came together</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.290" end="00:03:34.120" style="s2">and to purposely excluded Richard</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.590" end="00:03:35.980" style="s2">Spencer him all right from that event as</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.120" end="00:03:38.799" style="s2">a real statement that we wanted to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.980" end="00:03:42.310" style="s2">but Richard showed up to the after party</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.799" end="00:03:44.470" style="s2">crash the after party and I wasn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.310" end="00:03:47.319" style="s2">to have anything to do with that so as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.470" end="00:03:49.299" style="s2">democratic former Democrat rather who</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.319" end="00:03:52.150" style="s2">voted for Obama and voted for Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.299" end="00:03:55.319" style="s2">you know I was there&#39;s no way I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.150" end="00:03:55.319" style="s2">going to get affiliated with</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.350" end="00:04:01.030" style="s2">these guys were a part of it and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.270" end="00:04:03.550" style="s2">had a chance to confront Richard Spencer</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.030" end="00:04:06.160" style="s2">at this after-party and he and I almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.550" end="00:04:08.050" style="s2">came to blows at this party in front of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.160" end="00:04:10.990" style="s2">everybody and I got broken up at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.050" end="00:04:13.090" style="s2">last minute and my point was I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.990" end="00:04:17.140" style="s2">inject into the narrative here that all</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.090" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">right is not welcome this Coalition is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.140" end="00:04:20.920" style="s2">changing again it&#39;s morphing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">even not really finished being</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.920" end="00:04:24.610" style="s2">determined who&#39;s an athlete in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:29.050" style="s2">coalition at this point they knew for</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.610" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">sure that I didn&#39;t want that and luckily</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.050" end="00:04:32.890" style="s2">the Atlantic was there the New Yorker</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:35.470" style="s2">was there Business Insider CNN they all</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.890" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">wrote about it afterwards they say big a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.470" end="00:04:40.270" style="s2">big bearded man named Jack Murphy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">they said you know it&#39;s a month it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.270" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">like a joyous evening but it was ended</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.310" end="00:04:49.090" style="s2">in a fractious confrontation at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:51.970" style="s2">after-party which was perfect for me and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.090" end="00:04:54.550" style="s2">I was about that because again it began</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.970" end="00:04:57.340" style="s2">this narrative and then the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.550" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">also sort of continued on when my</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.340" end="00:05:09.430" style="s2">friends Jack sobic and my son of its did</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:11.290" style="s2">an event in in DC and it was a counter</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.430" end="00:05:12.940" style="s2">rally a counter protest to Richard</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.290" end="00:05:13.400" style="s2">Spencer and all right guys who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.940" end="00:05:15.229" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.400" end="00:05:20.060" style="s2">Jefferson or at the Lincoln Memorial</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.229" end="00:05:21.979" style="s2">rather and sort of close the loop on</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.060" end="00:05:35.870" style="s2">this you know there we were having a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.979" end="00:05:37.490" style="s2">rally against violence not only did we</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.870" end="00:05:38.870" style="s2">find the override you Zipporah and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.490" end="00:05:40.430" style="s2">think we want to be a part of but we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.870" end="00:05:42.229" style="s2">also knew that these knuckleheads were</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.430" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">gonna do something stupid and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.229" end="00:05:45.889" style="s2">been working and working and working to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:48.620" style="s2">try to separate ourselves from from that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.889" end="00:05:50.510" style="s2">group and frankly I think I think now by</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.620" end="00:06:03.020" style="s2">this point that&#39;s actually the textures</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.510" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">are starting to work although for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.020" end="00:06:12.590" style="s2">personally that shows that you know just</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:15.099" style="s2">that there&#39;s still this desire out there</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.590" end="00:06:15.099" style="s2">on the left</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.249" end="00:06:23.799" style="s2">Emeritus so that&#39;s just a little context</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.519" end="00:06:25.539" style="s2">for me in charlottesville here and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.799" end="00:06:27.939" style="s2">should have proper starting with</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.539" end="00:06:29.379" style="s2">introduction of myself but I&#39;m from</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.939" end="00:06:43.449" style="s2">Virginia with the high school in Laurel</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.379" end="00:06:46.509" style="s2">Virginia and I wanted to get into</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.449" end="00:06:48.789" style="s2">finance and international investment</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.509" end="00:06:54.309" style="s2">banking in particular because at that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.789" end="00:06:56.229" style="s2">time at the end of the 90s at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.309" end="00:07:00.849" style="s2">the nineties you know the Cold War was</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.229" end="00:07:02.499" style="s2">over and the geopolitical orientation</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.849" end="00:07:05.019" style="s2">had shifted away from chasing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.499" end="00:07:07.209" style="s2">Soviets around the globe and people</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.019" end="00:07:09.909" style="s2">began to dust off the Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.209" end="00:07:12.759" style="s2">and they started to look worse South and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.909" end="00:07:16.809" style="s2">Central America and George Bush was</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.759" end="00:07:20.109" style="s2">later began to talk about free trade</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.809" end="00:07:22.689" style="s2">area of the agree free trade agreement</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.109" end="00:07:24.489" style="s2">of the Americas looking to create a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.689" end="00:07:28.749" style="s2">trade bloc you know like to eat you but</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.489" end="00:07:30.189" style="s2">from Antarctica to the Arctic and Latin</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.749" end="00:07:32.799" style="s2">America was sort of the exciting place</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.189" end="00:07:34.419" style="s2">to be and it was a new sort of regional</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.799" end="00:07:39.789" style="s2">orientation rather than a global</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.419" end="00:07:41.289" style="s2">orientation and so I wanted to get into</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.289" end="00:07:45.329" style="s2">the focus on Latin America so I go to</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.940" end="00:07:50.650" style="s2">- and international political economy</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.040" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">and international affairs and then 9/11</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.650" end="00:07:55.570" style="s2">happens like in my last semester</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:07:58.810" style="s2">obviously a huge tragedy but the way it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.570" end="00:08:00.370" style="s2">impacted me personally was that one all</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.810" end="00:08:03.030" style="s2">the jobs on Wall Street were over so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.370" end="00:08:05.530" style="s2">have to look for something new and to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.030" end="00:08:20.200" style="s2">reoriented the world the way we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.530" end="00:08:22.060" style="s2">this path so I needed to find something</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.200" end="00:08:23.980" style="s2">new I get into real estate because at</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.060" end="00:08:33.640" style="s2">the time in DC real estate was really</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.980" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">was popping and I got into charter</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.640" end="00:08:38.650" style="s2">schools charter schools are an</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:41.229" style="s2">independently operated privately owned</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.650" end="00:08:44.350" style="s2">public school that are open to any kid</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.229" end="00:08:45.790" style="s2">in the District of Columbia and in doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.350" end="00:08:47.890" style="s2">that I began to work with inner-city</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.790" end="00:08:49.540" style="s2">kids and I started became an executive</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.890" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">director of a number of charter schools</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.540" end="00:08:54.700" style="s2">in DC where I worked to turn around some</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:57.820" style="s2">of the worst performing schools in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.700" end="00:08:59.950" style="s2">city and work towards building new</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.820" end="00:09:03.000" style="s2">institutions to help these are 99%</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.950" end="00:09:03.000" style="s2">african-american schools</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.779" end="00:09:09.269" style="s2">so you could say in some ways as I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.120" end="00:09:12.540" style="s2">working for equity and student outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.269" end="00:09:14.790" style="s2">that I was social justice warriors</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.540" end="00:09:16.589" style="s2">before that term became what it meant</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.790" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">today you know I was an actual actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.589" end="00:09:22.050" style="s2">working to find a way to improve</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:24.930" style="s2">education outcomes now I tell you all</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.050" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">this because something happened which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.930" end="00:09:33.709" style="s2">really pertinent to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">becoming Democrats in the country</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.709" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">around that time in 2015 I began writing</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:43.589" style="s2">and I was writing under a pending and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:45.360" style="s2">Jeff Murphy is my pen name my real name</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.589" end="00:09:48.170" style="s2">is John Goldman everybody knows it now</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.360" end="00:09:51.990" style="s2">but I stuck with Jack Murphy because</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.170" end="00:09:53.970" style="s2">began I think I began writing about sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.990" end="00:09:59.029" style="s2">and relationships to be honest it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.970" end="00:09:59.029" style="s2">sort of like a hobby I was you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:15.160" style="s2">why people getting married why is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:17.900" style="s2">hard to find the right partner etc and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.160" end="00:10:21.080" style="s2">in that process I began to understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.900" end="00:10:23.750" style="s2">that the forces that disrupted the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.080" end="00:10:32.060" style="s2">bedroom also disrupted the country and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.750" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">user ideas like radical feminism and as</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.060" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">I&#39;m learning about all this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">starting to get tuned into the way the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:38.810" style="s2">media has control your minds and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:43.070" style="s2">media&#39;s control narratives something</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.810" end="00:10:46.400" style="s2">else very relevant happen repost so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.070" end="00:10:49.640" style="s2">guess it was about 2014 or so 2015 and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.400" end="00:10:51.380" style="s2">immediately when that happened me and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.640" end="00:10:53.390" style="s2">friend see you guys online we all sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.380" end="00:10:57.500" style="s2">of we saw that it was and we could tell</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.390" end="00:10:59.240" style="s2">that it was but it had such huge impact</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.500" end="00:11:01.520" style="s2">on the school had huge impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.240" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">nation had huge impact on me personally</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.520" end="00:11:06.650" style="s2">and seeing that the media narratives</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:08.450" style="s2">sort of take over and these lies and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.650" end="00:11:10.580" style="s2">control us right so like it was all</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.450" end="00:11:12.440" style="s2">about promoting rape culture it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.580" end="00:11:13.640" style="s2">about promoting you know misogyny and</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.620" end="00:11:33.740" style="s2">begin to see sort of the writing on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.420" end="00:11:35.889" style="s2">wall this is like a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.740" end="00:11:43.449" style="s2">experience for somebody with a Democrat</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.889" end="00:11:43.449" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to see how universities</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.900" end="00:13:07.960" style="s2">during the election we went to a party</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.960" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">for freedom people market people from</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.510" end="00:13:24.100" style="s2">all over the country comes and at that</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.100" end="00:13:28.870" style="s2">this woman Chelsea Manning was there and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.100" end="00:13:31.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re familiar with her story she</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.870" end="00:13:33.310" style="s2">was depending on your viewpoint she was</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.720" end="00:13:35.560" style="s2">either the trainer or the muscle blower</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.310" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">who was in the military who was thrown</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.560" end="00:13:38.470" style="s2">in jail</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:41.170" style="s2">and while she was in I think while she</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.470" end="00:13:43.050" style="s2">was in solitary confinement she decided</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.170" end="00:13:45.400" style="s2">to transition from male to female and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.050" end="00:13:47.380" style="s2">she showed up at this party and she was</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.400" end="00:13:48.940" style="s2">a progressive and we had actually met</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.380" end="00:13:55.000" style="s2">her and hung out with her a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.940" end="00:13:57.250" style="s2">just totally casually but we were</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.000" end="00:13:58.690" style="s2">hanging out and I first met her and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.250" end="00:14:01.100" style="s2">somebody took a picture and that picture</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.690" end="00:14:03.870" style="s2">is going to become her home</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.100" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">this party she was there everybody on</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.870" end="00:14:07.290" style="s2">the progressive side decided that this</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:09.060" style="s2">was a horrible thing that Chelsea</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:12.420" style="s2">Manning was at this event that was for</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.060" end="00:14:15.540" style="s2">market people and so the next day that</p>

<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:58.710" style="s2">a really important project the book is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.360" end="00:19:01.260" style="s2">important because nine million people</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.710" end="00:19:04.170" style="s2">had the same experience that I had an</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">being pushed upon them and in an</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.800" end="00:19:19.110" style="s2">election where you know Trump got</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:21.000" style="s2">something like sixty million votes nine</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.110" end="00:19:22.620" style="s2">million is like 50% of his tool so</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.000" end="00:19:26.390" style="s2">fifteen percent of the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.620" end="00:19:26.390" style="s2">part of the Trump coalition</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.060" end="00:19:31.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.530" end="00:19:33.000" style="s2">talked about very and these nine million</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.170" end="00:19:34.590" style="s2">people are perhaps one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.000" end="00:19:36.900" style="s2">important voting blocks in the country</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.590" end="00:19:42.380" style="s2">the election was determined by three</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.900" end="00:19:45.030" style="s2">states 77,000 folks across Michigan</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.380" end="00:19:47.640" style="s2">those regret states I&#39;m sorry this was</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.030" end="00:19:49.590" style="s2">blue states that turn red and these</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.640" end="00:19:51.960" style="s2">Democrat to deplorable voters were from</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.590" end="00:19:58.770" style="s2">all over in those regions and 77,000</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.960" end="00:20:01.260" style="s2">people are determined so the Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.770" end="00:20:02.670" style="s2">of the pourable voting bar is in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.260" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">the most important voting bloc in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.670" end="00:20:05.430" style="s2">America because these are people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:06.840" style="s2">are open to change these are people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.430" end="00:20:08.300" style="s2">are open to new messages and these are</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.840" end="00:20:10.950" style="s2">people that are willing to take risks</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.300" end="00:20:12.450" style="s2">take risk to be alienated from their</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.950" end="00:20:13.710" style="s2">friends and family you know supporting</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:21.900" style="s2">Donald Trump isn&#39;t always the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.710" end="00:20:23.370" style="s2">thing to do you know supporting him was</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.900" end="00:20:24.900" style="s2">something that became very important to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.370" end="00:20:28.260" style="s2">me and it was important to these nine</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.900" end="00:20:34.500" style="s2">million people so in the book the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.260" end="00:20:37.170" style="s2">section is a little bit of a memoir and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.500" end="00:20:39.870" style="s2">then I conducted a national survey so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.170" end="00:20:41.610" style="s2">did original research for this fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.870" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">hundred people responded to my survey</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.610" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">and there were 67 questions 15 of which</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">were open-ended responses which means I</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:52.160" style="s2">was only like 10 or 12,000 like</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:52.160" style="s2">paragraphs and essays from people</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.920" end="00:20:59.030" style="s2">the year and I got a whole treasure</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:01.460" style="s2">trove of statistics that no one else was</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.030" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">asking the same questions everybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.460" end="00:21:15.830" style="s2">bases their electoral analysis so I came</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">up with my own and I reached some people</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.830" end="00:21:18.650" style="s2">all over the country and then I also</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:20.030" style="s2">realized that I needed to get out and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.650" end="00:21:26.270" style="s2">talk to people so I got my car I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.030" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">started driving around just started</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.270" end="00:21:32.360" style="s2">talking to people in shops from street</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:34.430" style="s2">corners and I set up interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.360" end="00:21:36.710" style="s2">people from all over the country</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.430" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">and I recorded you know probably 50</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.710" end="00:21:46.130" style="s2">hours and there&#39;s a whole number of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:48.230" style="s2">results in this book but I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.130" end="00:21:49.790" style="s2">about one thing in particular that would</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.230" end="00:21:53.350" style="s2">be of relevance to you guys and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.790" end="00:21:57.170" style="s2">a whole section on colleges and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.350" end="00:22:00.740" style="s2">something like 92% of people who went</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.750" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">people see it is that college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.400" end="00:22:11.900" style="s2">have become indoctrination camps for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:14.840" style="s2">progressive sort of mindset</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.900" end="00:22:17.150" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to sort of dismiss that</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.200" end="00:22:27.770" style="s2">philosophy that I&#39;ll explain the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.390" end="00:22:29.510" style="s2">that that made it into our federal</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.110" end="00:22:39.290" style="s2">and the narratives on campus and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.860" end="00:22:41.090" style="s2">was one of the out of all the questions</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.159" end="00:24:16.889" style="s2">radical notion into your brain at 18</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.279" end="00:24:20.049" style="s2">years old as a freshman as subtle</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.889" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">science as something that is complete</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.049" end="00:24:26.029" style="s2">but it&#39;s not this is obviously a highly</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:31.190" style="s2">contentious issue that isn&#39;t and by any</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.029" end="00:24:38.029" style="s2">means so probably we agree here that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.190" end="00:24:40.039" style="s2">know a prosperous notion now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.029" end="00:24:42.260" style="s2">important about this also is that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.039" end="00:25:06.470" style="s2">know it sets up a science denial</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.260" end="00:25:08.269" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s also a way and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.470" end="00:25:09.860" style="s2">notion has become popularized I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.269" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">Jordan Peterson got really famous over</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.860" end="00:25:16.389" style="s2">protesting that you know it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:18.679" style="s2">making its way into law in California</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.389" end="00:25:21.649" style="s2">it&#39;s very specific it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.679" end="00:25:23.899" style="s2">senior citizen homes or something but if</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.649" end="00:25:25.309" style="s2">you like refer to somebody in a home by</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.899" end="00:25:27.889" style="s2">the wrong gender it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.309" end="00:25:29.419" style="s2">actually a criminal offense so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.889" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">the first thing they started denying</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.419" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">science they start language control and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">they start manipulating your brain right</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:36.350" style="s2">out of the bath the second thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:39.460" style="s2">they do is they tell you that you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.350" end="00:25:42.919" style="s2">biased and that you all have an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.460" end="00:25:45.290" style="s2">predisposition to racism and there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.919" end="00:25:48.380" style="s2">it&#39;s all based on this testimony</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.290" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">Association test and that test has been</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.380" end="00:25:53.510" style="s2">debunked 50 times million times</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:57.080" style="s2">in fact even even the people that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.510" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">created the test now say that the test</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.080" end="00:26:01.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say what they thought but that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:03.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t stop the multi-billion dollar</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.550" end="00:26:05.810" style="s2">industry that it was born out of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.410" end="00:26:07.700" style="s2">test that has infiltrated every human</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.810" end="00:26:09.800" style="s2">resources department every corporate</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.920" end="00:26:20.180" style="s2">have them usually no matter what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.960" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">done in your life no matter how overt</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.180" end="00:26:32.120" style="s2">your actions have been otherwise inside</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">you know discriminatory the third thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:41.090" style="s2">that they do but Jonathan he wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">book and it&#39;s about how and why people</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.090" end="00:26:48.050" style="s2">have different views on politics and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:49.790" style="s2">morality and one of the base one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.050" end="00:26:51.710" style="s2">basis for his thesis and it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.790" end="00:26:54.140" style="s2">book and I highly recommend it was this</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.710" end="00:26:55.610" style="s2">implicit association test and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.140" end="00:26:57.560" style="s2">had a chance to ask him about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.610" end="00:27:00.830" style="s2">directly just a few weeks ago a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.560" end="00:27:02.300" style="s2">in-person and I said you know hey now</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.830" end="00:27:05.990" style="s2">that this is implicit association test</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.300" end="00:27:07.730" style="s2">has been debunked you have any second</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.990" end="00:27:09.800" style="s2">thoughts about your thesis and he said</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.730" end="00:27:11.570" style="s2">no because it was just one of like 50</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.800" end="00:27:13.190" style="s2">things he cited but he also noted that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.570" end="00:27:15.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a replication crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.190" end="00:27:17.720" style="s2">psychology and so a lot of these tests</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.830" end="00:27:20.180" style="s2">that built these industries literally</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:21.010" style="s2">billion-dollar industries around how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.180" end="00:27:22.810" style="s2">correct you</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.010" end="00:27:24.610" style="s2">lissa bias basically what they want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.810" end="00:27:26.170" style="s2">do is like rewire your brain through</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.610" end="00:27:28.690" style="s2">trainings and manipulation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.170" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">brainwashing there&#39;s multi-billion</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.690" end="00:27:32.110" style="s2">dollar businesses based on something</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:35.020" style="s2">flawed that can&#39;t be able to be created</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.110" end="00:27:37.510" style="s2">but nobody&#39;s stopping that bus right</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.020" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere and it&#39;s easy to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.510" end="00:27:41.400" style="s2">only things as crazy ideas but when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:43.750" style="s2">look at but like I said it&#39;s in every</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.400" end="00:27:45.850" style="s2">corporate HR department every</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.750" end="00:27:47.590" style="s2">institution every academic institution</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.850" end="00:27:50.050" style="s2">colleges trickling down to your high</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.590" end="00:27:51.550" style="s2">schools everywhere that everyone has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.050" end="00:27:55.660" style="s2">racist inside them that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.550" end="00:27:57.820" style="s2">fixed the third thing that they do is</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.660" end="00:28:00.550" style="s2">they teach you that your emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.820" end="00:28:02.290" style="s2">more important in fact the reason and at</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.550" end="00:28:04.570" style="s2">American there&#39;s a whole there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.290" end="00:28:06.760" style="s2">section in their orientation that says</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.570" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">that you&#39;re responsible for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.760" end="00:28:12.540" style="s2">emotional response of the listener to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:15.250" style="s2">your statements and it&#39;s irrespective of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.540" end="00:28:16.810" style="s2">your intentions irrespective of fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.250" end="00:28:19.000" style="s2">it&#39;s irrespective of what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.810" end="00:28:20.830" style="s2">said whatever that person&#39;s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.000" end="00:28:24.130" style="s2">reaction is is the most important</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.830" end="00:28:25.870" style="s2">element in that engagement and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.130" end="00:28:27.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually teaching people is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.870" end="00:28:29.560" style="s2">something that psychologists call</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.610" end="00:28:34.300" style="s2">emotional reasoning which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.560" end="00:28:36.310" style="s2">will lead you down and so not only are</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.300" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">they teaching you the science doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.310" end="00:28:39.490" style="s2">matter that language can be controlled</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:42.490" style="s2">that you&#39;re all racist but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.490" end="00:28:44.740" style="s2">teaching you that your emotions are more</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.490" end="00:28:46.040" style="s2">important than fact and more important</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.740" end="00:28:48.770" style="s2">than reason any more important</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.040" end="00:28:50.870" style="s2">and objectivity and so when you combine</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.770" end="00:28:54.410" style="s2">them all together you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.870" end="00:28:56.330" style="s2">not a difficult thing to see how it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.410" end="00:28:59.090" style="s2">feels like an indoctrination process</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.330" end="00:29:01.510" style="s2">rather than like hey when I when I went</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.090" end="00:29:03.530" style="s2">to college way back in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.510" end="00:29:06.920" style="s2">orientation was like where&#39;s the library</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.530" end="00:29:09.320" style="s2">how to get online and I think blackboard</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.920" end="00:29:11.270" style="s2">like that just started back then and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.320" end="00:29:13.160" style="s2">like that&#39;s what orientation was now</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.270" end="00:29:17.180" style="s2">orientation is about injecting this</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.160" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">ideology and then I don&#39;t know about you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.180" end="00:29:23.210" style="s2">guys at UVA and imagine this is accurate</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">and your whole life all you thought was</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.210" end="00:29:25.850" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to college there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:27.410" style="s2">never a minute where you saw a future</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.850" end="00:29:28.910" style="s2">vision of yourself though did once in</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.410" end="00:29:31.010" style="s2">the college graduate you spent your high</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.010" end="00:29:35.570" style="s2">to get into a school like UVA and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.590" end="00:29:37.430" style="s2">when you get to get to college in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.570" end="00:29:38.780" style="s2">freshman and you thinking this is some</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.780" end="00:29:41.510" style="s2">about my whole life and everybody told</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.460" end="00:29:43.280" style="s2">me is the greatest thing in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.510" end="00:29:45.320" style="s2">wide world and the first thing they do</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.280" end="00:29:47.060" style="s2">is start rewiring your brain you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.320" end="00:29:51.080" style="s2">you&#39;re open to that type of manipulation</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.330" end="00:30:00.110" style="s2">and as if all this and by the way this</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.800" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">places where our minds</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.780" end="00:33:17.970" style="s2">and there&#39;s it&#39;s multivariable obviously</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.770" end="00:33:19.650" style="s2">but one of the things that I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.970" end="00:33:22.800" style="s2">focused in the book is title not</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.650" end="00:33:25.050" style="s2">entitlement is a law that was created in</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.800" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">the 70s which was meant to protect women</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.050" end="00:33:28.260" style="s2">from being sexually harassed to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.260" style="s2">point where they are unable to get an</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.260" end="00:33:38.430" style="s2">in athletic programs and scholarships</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.970" end="00:33:41.540" style="s2">all great stuff but as time went on it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.430" end="00:33:44.550" style="s2">became mutated and twisted and as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.540" end="00:33:53.670" style="s2">rape culture statistics started to grow</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.550" end="00:33:58.370" style="s2">first it was it&#39;s now 1 into 1 in 3 of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.670" end="00:34:01.500" style="s2">women on campus violence every year and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.370" end="00:34:03.660" style="s2">this idea has worked this way into our</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.500" end="00:34:07.850" style="s2">institutions and then through law and in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.660" end="00:34:10.220" style="s2">2011 Barack Obama&#39;s Education Department</p>

<p begin="00:34:19.530" end="00:34:22.110" style="s2">to the new policies and they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.850" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">lose their money and all these schools</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.110" end="00:34:28.410" style="s2">will depend on federal funds and there</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:31.230" style="s2">is an ideology that sort of wormed its</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.410" end="00:34:33.390" style="s2">way into our institutions it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.780" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">like there&#39;s the increasing diversity</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.830" end="00:46:51.260" style="s2">get people thinking about the future and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.270" end="00:46:54.170" style="s2">thinking about what what taxation</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.260" end="00:46:57.020" style="s2">and I remember a story a professor told</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.170" end="00:46:59.600" style="s2">me at George Mason about the origins of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.020" end="00:47:01.130" style="s2">taxation you know tribes used to just</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.600" end="00:47:02.540" style="s2">like Mourad and kill each other and take</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.130" end="00:47:05.510" style="s2">all their stuff but then one day the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.540" end="00:47:06.740" style="s2">guys like I don&#39;t kill these describe I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.510" end="00:47:07.550" style="s2">can come back next year and take half</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.740" end="00:47:09.650" style="s2">their setup again</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.550" end="00:47:10.790" style="s2">and that&#39;s where taxation came from</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.650" end="00:47:13.730" style="s2">right it&#39;s just a way of extracting</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.790" end="00:47:15.950" style="s2">resources so if you think about personal</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.730" end="00:47:18.080" style="s2">property and you think about the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.950" end="00:47:19.580" style="s2">your money I think that that&#39;s an easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.080" end="00:47:21.530" style="s2">ideological case to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.580" end="00:47:22.910" style="s2">of course we&#39;re having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.530" end="00:47:25.430" style="s2">convincing people on the left of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.910" end="00:47:27.500" style="s2">right now so not the best answer for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.430" end="00:47:28.970" style="s2">but I think keeping people future future</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.500" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">oriented especially what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.970" end="00:47:35.960" style="s2">about taxation and it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:37.670" style="s2">you say that the social issues aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.960" end="00:47:40.600" style="s2">what&#39;s dividing us down its fiscal</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.670" end="00:47:40.600" style="s2">fiscal policy</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.340" end="00:47:45.710" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying on the front lines</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.150" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">you see the front coalition expanding</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.710" end="00:47:51.620" style="s2">2020 yes I think that the nine million</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:53.720" style="s2">people that were stood being called</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.620" end="00:47:55.400" style="s2">racist are being called whatever getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.720" end="00:47:57.380" style="s2">ostracized from their family in their</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.400" end="00:48:00.140" style="s2">community for exciting to embrace Donald</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.380" end="00:48:02.330" style="s2">Trump not going back so that nine</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.140" end="00:48:03.980" style="s2">million is gonna grow I mean at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.330" end="00:48:05.930" style="s2">point I can&#39;t see a single candidate</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.980" end="00:48:08.450" style="s2">that the Democrats before the 2020 that</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.930" end="00:48:10.670" style="s2">offers any competition irrespective of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.450" end="00:48:13.970" style="s2">what happens in the gubernatorial races</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.670" end="00:48:16.340" style="s2">or in the House races or Senate I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">on a presidential level idea I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.340" end="00:48:22.760" style="s2">any competition but you never know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.290" style="s2">will happen at this point in the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.760" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">election Donald Trump wasn&#39;t on</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.010" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">stuff up close and personal so what I do</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.050" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">know for a fact is that the media spins</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:48:54.359" style="s2">everything any which way they want to so</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:56.130" style="s2">what really happened on the ground is</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.359" end="00:48:59.190" style="s2">probably hard to figure out but I will</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.130" end="00:49:00.810" style="s2">say that I know for sure that the proud</p>
