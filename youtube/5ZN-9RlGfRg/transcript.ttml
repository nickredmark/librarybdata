<p begin="00:00:00.170" end="00:00:04.830" style="s2">hi this is Eric Weinstein and welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.610" end="00:00:09.750" style="s2">back to my youtube channel so there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.830" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">two exogenously thinking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.750" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">differently today the first is that this</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:18.930" style="s2">is my office and has been my office for</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">about five years here at teal Capitol</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">and with reorganization I&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">moving out of this office and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.830" end="00:00:30.630" style="s2">that that&#39;s important is that some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">you have questioned why there is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.630" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">ghostly image on the glass window behind</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.190" style="s2">me and I thought it would might be</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">interesting to talk about that and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.190" end="00:00:42.690" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s motivating me is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">while I was sitting in a parked car I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.690" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">was rear-ended rather suddenly and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:51.510" style="s2">dramatically yesterday the airbags and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">the other car went off and I got to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">thinking about with all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">that we do to try to extend life and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">make life worth living we forget how</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">fragile it is and had things been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">little bit different I might have</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">sustained some some more serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:12.090" style="s2">injuries and I was just put in mind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:15.650" style="s2">what really is important to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.090" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">before we leave this beautiful world and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.650" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">those two things have me thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">a topic that I hadn&#39;t expected to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">discuss which is the subject of who that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">person is and the importance of having</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">an arch-nemesis so in my case I feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">very fortunate that I have selected an</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">arch-nemesis who really suits me and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">since I don&#39;t have a fleet of Tesla&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">and I don&#39;t have ski chalets all over</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">the world the one luxury item that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:52.470" style="s2">have that many people don&#39;t is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">arch-nemesis and I thought I&#39;d talk a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.470" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">little bit about how important in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">genomicist can be and how you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">acquire one what thinking should go into</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">your process and what you might hope to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">get out of it so in my case what my</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">belief is that an arch-nemesis is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:10.649" style="s2">really important decision in your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:12.380" style="s2">much like choosing a life partner or</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.649" end="00:02:17.810" style="s2">what city you will live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.380" end="00:02:20.120" style="s2">or what area you will choose in which to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.810" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">build your skills so that you might have</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.120" end="00:02:27.020" style="s2">a fulfilling profession I think when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">when you&#39;ve taken arch-nemesis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.020" end="00:02:35.000" style="s2">important to realize that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:37.250" style="s2">really about the cartoon relationships</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.000" end="00:02:40.030" style="s2">that superheroes have with their their</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.250" end="00:02:43.790" style="s2">principal enemies and arch-nemesis is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.030" end="00:02:45.740" style="s2">something much richer to me it is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.790" end="00:02:48.980" style="s2">general a human being with whom you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.740" end="00:02:53.540" style="s2">share a tremendous amount but you differ</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.980" end="00:02:55.850" style="s2">on some subset of issues where that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.540" end="00:03:01.970" style="s2">difference means that you cannot both</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.850" end="00:03:05.000" style="s2">win and in my case what I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.970" end="00:03:08.930" style="s2">sympathetic with is the objective of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.000" end="00:03:09.890" style="s2">arch-nemesis and when I&#39;m very what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.930" end="00:03:13.550" style="s2">what I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.890" end="00:03:15.710" style="s2">divided on from my arch-nemesis is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.550" end="00:03:19.130" style="s2">method by which we are both trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.710" end="00:03:22.340" style="s2">get to this common destination so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.130" end="00:03:24.650" style="s2">could think of this for example in terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.340" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">of the civil rights movement where</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.650" end="00:03:31.270" style="s2">Martin Luther King and Malcolm X both</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:36.200" style="s2">probably shared many goals which was</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.270" end="00:03:38.360" style="s2">true liberation and equality for black</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.200" end="00:03:42.320" style="s2">America but they probably differed a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.360" end="00:03:44.209" style="s2">tremendous amount on the means by which</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.320" end="00:03:48.290" style="s2">they were willing to get there and both</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.209" end="00:03:52.570" style="s2">of them held the other in a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.290" end="00:03:55.550" style="s2">of respect but may have felt very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.570" end="00:03:57.410" style="s2">sharply different from the other about</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.550" end="00:03:59.330" style="s2">the modalities by which they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.410" end="00:04:04.420" style="s2">interested in getting to that common</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.330" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">objective so in my case the objective</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.420" end="00:04:09.740" style="s2">was to try to understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:11.390" style="s2">physical world was all about what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.740" end="00:04:12.230" style="s2">this place in which we are having this</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.390" end="00:04:15.020" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.230" end="00:04:18.260" style="s2">what is the construct in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.020" end="00:04:20.450" style="s2">viewing a YouTube video you can think</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.260" end="00:04:23.270" style="s2">about this from the perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.450" end="00:04:24.860" style="s2">atoms in your screen or the photons of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.270" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">light that are reaching your eyeballs</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.860" end="00:04:29.310" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:33.270" style="s2">what is this strange place that that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.310" end="00:04:35.819" style="s2">call reality and the gentleman who is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.270" end="00:04:39.569" style="s2">depicted over my shoulder on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.819" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">glass in dry erase ink is Garrett Lisi</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.569" end="00:04:45.060" style="s2">and he was famous or infamous several</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:47.580" style="s2">years ago as the surfer dude with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.060" end="00:04:51.900" style="s2">theory of everything and he lives in</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.580" end="00:04:54.229" style="s2">Maui has somehow never seemingly really</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.900" end="00:04:59.130" style="s2">held a job that would lead to a career</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.229" end="00:05:00.870" style="s2">he has made a couple of investment</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.130" end="00:05:02.759" style="s2">decisions which have really worked out</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:06.030" style="s2">to make sure that he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.759" end="00:05:08.039" style="s2">have to work so he has a very enviable</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.030" end="00:05:10.590" style="s2">lifestyle but he&#39;s also willing to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.039" end="00:05:13.650" style="s2">in a van with zero security so he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.590" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">real risk taker and what&#39;s more he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.650" end="00:05:20.130" style="s2">very interested in an approach to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:22.949" style="s2">finding a theory of everything or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.130" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">theory of reality if you will that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.949" end="00:05:26.310" style="s2">think is quite interesting and beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:31.590" style="s2">I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to work</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.310" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">based on a set of symmetries which are</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.590" end="00:05:38.550" style="s2">called a Lee group 4 it&#39;s a fancy</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">mathematician way of saying a collection</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.550" end="00:05:43.710" style="s2">of continuous symmetries but in his face</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:44.969" style="s2">the Lee group he chose which was also</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:47.430" style="s2">the lead group that I found most</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.969" end="00:05:49.400" style="s2">interesting called e8 and it&#39;s a two</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.430" end="00:05:51.930" style="s2">hundred and forty eight dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.400" end="00:05:56.009" style="s2">beast of an object we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.930" end="00:05:58.110" style="s2">visualize it and it is suggestive</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.009" end="00:06:03.389" style="s2">because of ways in which it combines</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.110" end="00:06:07.050" style="s2">what you might call regular vector</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.389" end="00:06:09.240" style="s2">vector like objects with exotic spinner</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.050" end="00:06:12.659" style="s2">like objects something but vectors is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.240" end="00:06:14.690" style="s2">what gives you photons and spinners is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.659" end="00:06:16.979" style="s2">what gives you electrons and so somehow</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.690" end="00:06:19.469" style="s2">vectors and spinners are bound together</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.979" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">in this crazy object he ate and Garrett</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.469" end="00:06:25.500" style="s2">decided to make that the centerpiece of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:26.789" style="s2">his attempt to unify physics now despite</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.500" end="00:06:28.110" style="s2">the fact that I think here it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.789" end="00:06:30.719" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think what he&#39;s doing will</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.110" end="00:06:33.569" style="s2">will work he is one of the only people</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.719" end="00:06:36.620" style="s2">in the entire world who are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.569" end="00:06:39.310" style="s2">put forward what might be termed</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.620" end="00:06:41.560" style="s2">something like a theory of everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.310" end="00:06:44.410" style="s2">now you can say that it&#39;s incomplete you</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.560" end="00:06:48.250" style="s2">can say that it&#39;s inconsistent but it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.410" end="00:06:53.230" style="s2">clearly an attempt to explain the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.250" end="00:06:57.090" style="s2">that we live in using a very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.230" end="00:06:59.260" style="s2">piece of mathematical machinery and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.090" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">despite the fact that I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.260" end="00:07:06.090" style="s2">that it works or even can be made to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:08.530" style="s2">work it is still a direct attempt at</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.090" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">resolving the major puzzles of art of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.530" end="00:07:13.419" style="s2">our time rather than working on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:15.010" style="s2">mathematical structure of physics so</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.419" end="00:07:19.600" style="s2">it&#39;s an attempt at an actual physical</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.010" end="00:07:22.120" style="s2">idea rather than an attempt at improving</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.600" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">the mathematics around physics hoping</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.120" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">that that will produce the answer so</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:31.030" style="s2">here the here are the criteria that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:34.570" style="s2">think are most important when choosing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.030" end="00:07:39.700" style="s2">an arch-nemesis first of all it should</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.570" end="00:07:42.970" style="s2">be somebody that you you want to see in</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.700" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">this world you should be sad if some if</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.970" end="00:07:49.690" style="s2">somehow your arch-nemesis were to meet a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:52.870" style="s2">bad end because you want that person to</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.690" end="00:07:53.800" style="s2">be with you and competing with you for</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.870" end="00:07:55.960" style="s2">the long haul</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.800" end="00:07:57.640" style="s2">so it should be somebody that you would</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.960" end="00:08:02.620" style="s2">be very upset if you found out that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.640" end="00:08:05.830" style="s2">were suddenly dead and removed from this</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.620" end="00:08:08.950" style="s2">mortal coil it should also be somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.830" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">who accepts you as his or her</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.950" end="00:08:15.640" style="s2">arch-nemesis I don&#39;t think you should</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:18.550" style="s2">just go about deciding the Elon Musk or</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.640" end="00:08:20.430" style="s2">or Donald Trump is your arch nemesis if</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.550" end="00:08:23.620" style="s2">they&#39;ve never even heard of you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.430" end="00:08:25.570" style="s2">much less they don&#39;t obsess about you so</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.620" end="00:08:27.820" style="s2">I think it&#39;s important that there be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.570" end="00:08:29.590" style="s2">level of yuechu ality and that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.820" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">choose your arch nemesis and the her</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.590" end="00:08:34.180" style="s2">arch nemesis chooses you or said it</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">slightly differently that you both</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.180" end="00:08:38.620" style="s2">recognize that this is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:42.400" style="s2">your relationship it should also be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.620" end="00:08:46.210" style="s2">case that if you were to lose you might</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.400" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">want them to win that&#39;s that&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.210" end="00:08:50.140" style="s2">thing to couple to the fact that in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">order for them to win you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.140" end="00:08:52.779" style="s2">lose but both of these conditions need</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:57.069" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.779" end="00:08:58.899" style="s2">met in general if my particular take on</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.069" end="00:09:02.680" style="s2">physics which I called geometric unity</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.899" end="00:09:06.579" style="s2">turned out to be vacuous I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.680" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">find out that Garrett actually had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.579" end="00:09:09.790" style="s2">theory that was workable it would it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:13.480" style="s2">would give me no pleasure to find out</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.790" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">that he too was also incorrect so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.480" end="00:09:18.490" style="s2">think that&#39;s a very complicated dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:21.639" style="s2">to get going it would be better if the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.490" end="00:09:23.709" style="s2">person was roughly your age we shared</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.639" end="00:09:26.709" style="s2">some of your characteristics I think you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.709" end="00:09:28.930" style="s2">need to be able to see some of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.709" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">in your arch-nemesis in my case I feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.930" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">like Garrett has been a renegade he has</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:37.720" style="s2">broken rules but he&#39;s also been an</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">insider and an outsider he has a PhD in</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.720" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">physics which is better than I can say</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:46.360" style="s2">where my PhD is in mathematics he has</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:48.309" style="s2">been more outside the system I stayed</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.360" end="00:09:53.529" style="s2">longer probably in the academic game</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.309" end="00:09:59.170" style="s2">than he did so it&#39;s there is a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.529" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2">degree of comparability and the picture</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.170" end="00:10:08.610" style="s2">that lies over my shoulder I started to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.100" end="00:10:08.610" style="s2">feel better about it when I saw into</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.089" end="00:10:15.639" style="s2">Floyd Mayweather&#39;s home after he</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.550" end="00:10:19.569" style="s2">defeated Conor McGregor and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.639" end="00:10:23.379" style="s2">photograph taken of Floyd Mayweather</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.569" end="00:10:25.959" style="s2">with giant pictures of him and Conor</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.379" end="00:10:27.759" style="s2">McGregor inside of his home and so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.959" end="00:10:31.779" style="s2">idea that you would actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.759" end="00:10:36.370" style="s2">represent your arch-nemesis inside of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.779" end="00:10:39.009" style="s2">your personal space is actually it makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.370" end="00:10:41.970" style="s2">complete sense to me so what I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.009" end="00:10:44.949" style="s2">you to think about is whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.970" end="00:10:47.319" style="s2">you&#39;re ready to choose an arch-nemesis</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.949" end="00:10:50.319" style="s2">to let that be a motivational decision</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.319" end="00:10:52.689" style="s2">to propel you to try to keep working on</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.319" end="00:10:55.779" style="s2">something when you feel discouraged to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.689" end="00:11:00.519" style="s2">use an aspect of competition which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.779" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">healthy i i&#39;m very often reminded of my</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.519" end="00:11:05.700" style="s2">my good friend Peter Till&#39;s admonition</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:08.700" style="s2">that competition is for</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.700" end="00:11:11.100" style="s2">the idea that when you spend your time</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.700" end="00:11:14.190" style="s2">focusing on someone else rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.100" end="00:11:16.140" style="s2">focusing on a very difficult problem you</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.190" end="00:11:17.910" style="s2">often get distracted from what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.140" end="00:11:20.250" style="s2">important and you find yourself in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.910" end="00:11:22.410" style="s2">kind of memetic rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.250" end="00:11:25.230" style="s2">I think the choosing an arch-nemesis is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.410" end="00:11:28.170" style="s2">a is a slight exception to this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.230" end="00:11:29.790" style="s2">generally pretty good rule when I get</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.170" end="00:11:32.520" style="s2">discouraged I don&#39;t feel like looking at</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.790" end="00:11:34.740" style="s2">physics it does help me to think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.520" end="00:11:41.250" style="s2">the fact that somewhere out there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.740" end="00:11:43.560" style="s2">Gareth is catching a wave in the waters</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.250" end="00:11:46.260" style="s2">off of Maui thinking about physics and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.560" end="00:11:49.650" style="s2">trying to push his theory forward so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.260" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">find that not dispiriting or enervating</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.650" end="00:11:55.590" style="s2">but I actually find it energizing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:58.620" style="s2">you know I realized that because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.590" end="00:12:01.400" style="s2">gonna have to leave this office it falls</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.620" end="00:12:05.010" style="s2">to me rather than some anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.400" end="00:12:07.290" style="s2">cleaning person to remove this picture</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.010" end="00:12:12.890" style="s2">off of off of the glass and it&#39;s on both</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.290" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">sides of the glass crystal veronik who</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.890" end="00:12:19.170" style="s2">drew this in dry erase ink who is at</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.990" end="00:12:20.370" style="s2">that point here its girlfriend drew it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.170" end="00:12:22.440" style="s2">on both sides of the glass and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.370" end="00:12:24.630" style="s2">remember thinking that it it would have</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.440" end="00:12:29.690" style="s2">to be me who would take it down because</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.630" end="00:12:32.910" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t want to allow anyone else to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.690" end="00:12:36.510" style="s2">remove that from from my life so if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.910" end="00:12:39.150" style="s2">don&#39;t mind as a symbolic action I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.510" end="00:12:41.460" style="s2">going to involve you all in the removal</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.150" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">of this piece of artwork from from my</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.460" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">office in my life as I change offices</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:51.060" style="s2">and I do want to say particularly to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:52.380" style="s2">young men consider that an arch-nemesis</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.060" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that you have to wait</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.380" end="00:12:56.400" style="s2">for when you find somebody with whom</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.350" style="s2">you&#39;re competitive where you have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.400" end="00:13:00.060" style="s2">of respect for that person and you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.350" end="00:13:02.070" style="s2">that person to motivate you over a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.060" end="00:13:05.130" style="s2">lifetime and you feel ready to make this</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.070" end="00:13:07.080" style="s2">decision remember you should only choose</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.130" end="00:13:09.750" style="s2">one and it should be a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.080" end="00:13:12.330" style="s2">relationship you should be in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.750" end="00:13:14.100" style="s2">with that arch-nemesis over time and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.330" end="00:13:15.780" style="s2">should be energizing to you both</p>
