<p begin="00:00:05.319" end="00:00:08.960" style="s2">If animals eat other animals, do you think that nature is violent and immoral?</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.960" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">When we look at how we should live as<br />humans that have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:18.599" style="s2">choose to live in very different ways<br />than we lived ancestrally,</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.599" end="00:00:22.910" style="s2">sometimes we look to nature for models<br />and its important to understand which models</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.910" end="00:00:24.670" style="s2">are relevant in which ones aren&#39;t<br />relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.670" end="00:00:28.099" style="s2">And so in the animal kingdom we see</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.099" end="00:00:31.699" style="s2">predatory cycles, we see predation and<br />some animals eating plants and some</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.699" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">animals eating other animals</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">and we see that&#39;s actually part the balance of the whole system, that the animals</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.980" end="00:00:41.320" style="s2">that are eating plants actually don&#39;t regulate their own consumption</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.320" end="00:00:43.890" style="s2">and they don&#39;t regulate their own<br />reproduction so they would breed themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.699" end="00:00:48.220" style="s2">beyond the caring capacity of their<br />environment and the process of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.220" end="00:00:51.850" style="s2">prey checking them is actually what<br />creates a dynamic balance.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.850" end="00:00:56.839" style="s2">When many look at that they<br />say that survival of the fittest is what drives evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.909" end="00:01:01.489" style="s2">and it&#39;s part of what drives balance and<br />it&#39;s a part of nature and that we&#39;re part of the food chain</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.589" end="00:01:06.860" style="s2">where animals, we&#39;re part of the  biosphere and that we should embrace being part of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.860" end="00:01:11.130" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple distinctions that<br />are really key</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.130" end="00:01:15.320" style="s2">I think to note here. One is</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.320" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">is a really subtle scientific<br />and philosophic point is</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:24.049" style="s2">that the reason there&#39;s predation in<br />nature the reason as a predatory process</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.049" end="00:01:25.890" style="s2">and it is violent and any</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:29.649" style="s2">animal that is on the prey side of<br />the equation will acknowledge that really clearly,</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:38.600" style="s2">is because the prey animals can&#39;t self-regulate sustainably because they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.600" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">the cognitive capacities, the<br />neurophysiological capacities to be able to </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.200" end="00:01:47.229" style="s2">assess what the caring capacity of their<br />environment is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.229" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">and then say hey we&#39;re gonna stop<br />reproducing now, we&#39;re going to slow</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:53.409" style="s2">reproduction rates, we&#39;re going to slow our consumption rates to actually live sustainably.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.409" end="00:01:56.689" style="s2">So when they start to out-breed<br />their own</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.689" end="00:02:01.060" style="s2">environmental capacities and there starts to be a scarcity resources for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.060" end="00:02:03.729" style="s2">creatures, some of the creatures start<br />actually prey on each other because</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.729" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">there isn&#39;t enough of the base<br />materials anymore there&#39;s too many of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">them they go into competition</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">as a function of that scarcity, as a<br />function of their inability,</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:16.260" style="s2">to modulate their own sustainability and<br />then those ones</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.260" end="00:02:19.690" style="s2">have an evolutionary niche were they<br />evolve in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.690" end="00:02:20.250" style="s2">predatory kind of animals.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.250" end="00:02:24.730" style="s2">So the predatory process<br />rises out of the unsustainability </p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:28.730" style="s2">or the incapacity of a species to be<br />self-sustaining, so that violence is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.730" end="00:02:30.140" style="s2">actually necessary</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.140" end="00:02:33.230" style="s2">for miss the species to continue</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.230" end="00:02:36.230" style="s2">and for the biosphere to continue and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.230" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s just a good thing<br />it&#39;s a necessary thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:43.480" style="s2">In nature it is a necessary thing.<br />With humans</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.480" end="00:02:47.950" style="s2">there is the fascinating thing that evolution<br />drives more complexity, more complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.950" end="00:02:49.750" style="s2">ability to respond so we see</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.750" end="00:02:53.390" style="s2">from a reptilian nervous system that&#39;s<br />kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.390" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">on/off modulated responses that<br />experience physiologic pain and pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">in those response capacities</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:03.320" style="s2">to mammalian nervous systems and their ability for emotion</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.320" end="00:03:07.100" style="s2">to neocortex primates and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.100" end="00:03:11.000" style="s2">dolphins purposes and their<br />capacity for cognition</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.000" end="00:03:14.990" style="s2">to then with humans in the prefrontal<br />cortex and the capacity for abstraction.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.990" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">We&#39;re the first creature that has this<br />abstraction capacity, we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">assess our environment&#39;s caring<br />capacity. We don&#39;t do a good job of this yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:24.020" style="s2">but we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.020" end="00:03:27.140" style="s2">assess hey how many of us can really<br />say here based on the resource per</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.140" end="00:03:28.060" style="s2">capita needs.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.060" end="00:03:32.410" style="s2">And then we could modulate the<br />efficiency of how we consume</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.410" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">and actually modulate our own reproduction to stay with in those caring capacity limits</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:37.700" style="s2">so that we didn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.700" end="00:03:42.290" style="s2">ongoing violence a check our numbers. Now, this is a capacity we have neurophysiologically</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.330" end="00:03:47.100" style="s2">because of our prefrontal cortex  and uniquely human capacities,  but it&#39;s not one we&#39;ve exercised</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.100" end="00:03:48.500" style="s2">well yet. We&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.500" end="00:03:52.060" style="s2">breeding irrespective of the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.060" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">resource limits on the planet and we&#39;re<br />still consuming irrespective of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:03:59.350" style="s2">unsustainable resource limits of the planet and as a result some human start praying on</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.350" end="00:04:00.220" style="s2">other humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.220" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">in different ways right through all<br />kinds a pathological competition.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.340" end="00:04:08.450" style="s2">It&#39;s an important note though that we<br />don&#39;t have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.450" end="00:04:12.670" style="s2">and that we&#39;re actually at the point<br />right now where because of our data</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.670" end="00:04:15.980" style="s2">harvesting capacities and really</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.980" end="00:04:19.090" style="s2">our ability to assess planetarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.090" end="00:04:22.319" style="s2">things that we couldn&#39;t even a few<br />generations ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.319" end="00:04:26.060" style="s2">because our technological capacities, that we really are for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.060" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">capable of saying how many people can<br />the earth support sustainably in harmony with</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:30.789" style="s2">the rest to the biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.789" end="00:04:34.150" style="s2">and how do we consciously self-regulate<br />as a whole species</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.150" end="00:04:37.479" style="s2">how we relate to the planet sustainably where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.479" end="00:04:40.949" style="s2">there&#39;s no need for predation<br />process continuing.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.949" end="00:04:44.870" style="s2">And what&#39;s so exciting about that to me is that we&#39;re the first species that really has the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.870" end="00:04:49.639" style="s2">to end the need for violence and to<br />really step up to that capacity, such</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.639" end="00:04:50.280" style="s2">an exciting thing.</p>
