<p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:15.200" style="s2">uh our our topic um which was proposed</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:16.720" style="s2">by alexander is the exodus versus the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.200" end="00:00:20.560" style="s2">lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.720" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">and um and i was thinking about uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.560" end="00:00:23.359" style="s2">i was thinking about heidegger and i was</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">thinking about his notion of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.359" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:29.439" style="s2">and i was thinking about the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:30.160" style="s2">person is the guy perhaps who joins the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.439" end="00:00:32.719" style="s2">exodus</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.160" end="00:00:33.280" style="s2">am i getting that right alexander or</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.719" end="00:00:34.640" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">but especially with looking at</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.640" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">leadership so um</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">in digital libido john cena question i</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:43.520" style="s2">identified the authentic phallus and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:46.879" style="s2">fake phallus</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.520" end="00:00:50.079" style="s2">the fake phallus leads uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:52.000" style="s2">by arranging uh an objection so say you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.079" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">got hitler and the jew you got started</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2">in the kulak</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">you got um paul pott and anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">wore glasses in cambodia in the 1970s so</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">or it could be just woke today has the</p>

<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">so you find somebody you can hate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">thereby in theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">unify everybody else into some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">right so that&#39;s how lynch mobs operate</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the fake fighter the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">follows though more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">and much more rare in history</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:21.759" style="s2">unfortunately is the proper authentic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">leader</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.759" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">now if you look at that&#39;s what we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">to study</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:28.400" style="s2">the exodus for the new book and not just</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">the exodus out of egypt but all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.400" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">exodus</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">since we&#39;ve been working with paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">shifts</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">our entire ubers all our books are about</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">the current paradigm shift essentially</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">what does it mean to leave industrialism</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">with capitalism and mass media and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">and the life we sort of lived here and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">moving to the new rom of the internet</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">society or or the internet age or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">network society</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">and digitalization what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">and of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:53.360" style="s2">a whole new class structural step</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:54.079" style="s2">forward some people are better at or</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">more fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.079" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">when it comes to having the resources</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">that pay off in the new society we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">identified that in the book called the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">democrats 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">so all the work is about paradigm shifts</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">and a paradigm shift really is an exodus</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">out of one age</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">into a new age so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">we call this exodology that&#39;s ex that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">pursue in this book the theory on</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">exodus why do they happen why do they</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">tend to be so successful compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">alternatives which is of course our</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">lynch mobs and why do you leave a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.360" style="s2">certain territory say</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">the egypt of the lynch mob and you walk</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">into the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">of the exodus um and what does that say</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">of course this ties into the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">phallus of course leads the exodus of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">moses for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">and the fake phallus who obviously leads</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">gerard&#39;s fantastic study on the lynch</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">mob</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">or not uh when he talks about satan</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">that is the tyrant to us and in our last</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">episode we talked about the accident the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">and the mob though right satan is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">spirit of the mob</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">no well the spirit of the mob is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">anoject so</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">what&#39;s important always is to find the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">precursor to the phenomenon you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">to study</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">so we can call all of this we can call</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">this paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">embryonism i suggested it to our dear</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">friend brady along the other day he</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">loved it so paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:23.440" style="s2">embryonism means you study who was lucky</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">enough to be in the right place at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">right time before the paradigm started</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">or who saw it coming and could therefore</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">prepare for it</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">and was hungry enough to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">benefit from it in other words who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">hebrew in egypt and moses comes along</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">okay so the anoject</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">is clearly the lynch mob it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">heideggerian dust man</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s clearly the uh nobody actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.720" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">says it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">it&#39;s assumed like you know does man is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">there is a heideggerian word for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">inauthentic is that yeah like one rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">than you or i so</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not somebody who speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">something i believe but rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">one believes oh i see and when you say</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">one belief you&#39;re hiding behind</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">something you say one believes in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">generals that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">well i just believe like everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">because i&#39;m a conformist and i&#39;m scared</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">of being in the outside of the group</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">because i&#39;m terrified of this i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">to pretend i&#39;m part of it so i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">to participate in the lens mob and i do</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.040" style="s2">that precisely by saying one believes</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">that that&#39;s the object that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.040" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">to kill</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">so you become the anonymous accuser</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really work in english</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">because one in english is still</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">you know even the queen of england could</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">say one or we whatever she says</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">but in german the term does man</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">not ma man with man with 2n m-a-n-n</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">which is just man</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">but man it&#39;s like it&#39;s very generous we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t know about or dutch thomas could</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">say that in swedish we have man as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">man say you saw instead of my i speak</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">you say man speak so you&#39;re hiding</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">behind something very honest</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">heidiger hated this right he he hated</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">his authentic behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">but what he didn&#39;t see what this was</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">part of the very lunch bob that he</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">participated in himself he was the nazis</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">so the lynch mobs</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">are assuming not only that they have an</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">the nazi party was never well organized</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">to make decisions for hitler</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">at a terrible time that&#39;s why he started</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">taking impediments during the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">because he had fighted so hard to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">to see he was terrified of people to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:43.400" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t at all a great leader no he</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">was just</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.400" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">personification of the anarchy with</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">like not puppet either because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">marinette that&#39;s being you you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:58.520" style="s2">know he knew what he was doing but he he</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">believed personally that he was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.520" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">personification of the german folk</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">and he was he was the personification of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">the german lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">i&#39;m sure gerard would agree so when i</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">agree with gerard he calls this figure</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">satan we call him the tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">heidegger thought about him he would</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">personify the german that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">heidegger got in trouble right</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">because in his early in his 30s he said</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">he said he said uh hitler personifies</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">the german people</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">yeah but he didn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">an ejection theory yet the pointer is</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">that nobody&#39;s done that before under</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">we&#39;re doing pioneering work</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to go deeper than chiron</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">did and by</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">by finding a precursor to gerard satan</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.319" end="00:07:49.680" style="s2">a precursor to the tyrant historically</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">we have the antidote</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">now since this is inverted exodus we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">doing the lynch mob goes towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">zero it goes towards no space left it</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">it goes towards staying within the realm</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">where you&#39;re at and then just minimizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">optimally until you die it&#39;s a doomsday</p>

<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.479" style="s2">hitlerism was a doomsday cult it was</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.479" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">so the question lynch mobs always are</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why they&#39;re temporary they blow</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">tons of havoc jacobins there was no way</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">the jacobins could ever run france</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">because all they did was guillotining</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">um i really like the interpretation of</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">very positive</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">interpretation of the over man which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">usually like</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">and also i think it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.120" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s probably going to be a group of</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">look like i think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">very important question that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">exodus comes in i agree completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">that&#39;s what the exodus comes in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t see any reason at all why the</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">of people the netocrats who are</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">and collaborate with the ai towards what</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">i call symbiotic transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t see any reason why they would</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">drug the vast majority of people with</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">especially if they weren&#39;t gratefully</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">received to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">now the atonist cult of egypt that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">became the origin of hebrewism and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">eventually judaism</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">uh that left egypt clearly was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">minority under</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">some kind of oppression in egypt or at</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">least they didn&#39;t feel they were part of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">the egyptian system at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">so you know tutankhamun was killed he</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">was probably the precursor to christ so</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">freud was probably right that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">activists of egypt and acton became</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">adonai</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">and adonai is the name when you unify</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">the other two facets of the jewish god</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">eloah which is general for god and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">you&#39;ve got jave</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">and jave is the vulcan volcanic god of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">the illamite so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">so so that means edomites so that means</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a rain god in the sun god</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">within the same divinity again judaism</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">reflectives or asterism makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s clearly the case with</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">judaism</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">now exodus means that a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">minority hard and are aware what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:52.399" style="s2">on and can benefit from the new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">leave</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.399" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s us we&#39;re the jews in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">other words i mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">in the sense the the people who are well</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">not necessarily but the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">uh don&#39;t fit any in uh to egypt</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">don&#39;t belong in egypt or or for good or</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">bad but the puritans of england</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">and mayflower is the same story all over</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a mimicking again gerard and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">mimiking</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">of the exodus out of egypt that became</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">the exodus out of europe and it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">especially the exodus out of catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">away from the catholic church because</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">protestantism was hijacked by the states</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">in northern europe</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">and if you just wanted to be say a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">non-state non-pope</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">christian person in europe you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">become puritan or a protestant who was</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">on the line with the state</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">and of course it was precisely those</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">protestants in northern and western</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">left for north america what they did was</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">that they then mimicked the exodus and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">then later they come</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">in volga verses of it like the mormons</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">going to utah et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">so this story of exodus is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">repeating the exodus is always a small</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">minority you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">why are we treated like shit here okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">well we don&#39;t want to be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">society anyway we stuck so this is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">a bunch of locus of losers</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">let&#39;s leave so i think when we</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">looking at the interaction between human</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">entitled to be part of that process of</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">i would see that collaboration rather</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">freely so you can become smart that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.639" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">i have a question um usually the jews</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.639" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">are considered like slaves right</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">when they&#39;re in in egypt and and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">they they you know they</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re you&#39;re describing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">exodus</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">as as a bunch of elite people yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">know but</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">but the jews weren&#39;t a bunch of elite</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">people they were slaves right</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">no wait a second they were not slaves in</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.560" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">the current</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">afro-american woke sense they were</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">slaves in the marxist sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">proletarians</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">i want to bring marx in here too yes no</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">this is why there&#39;s a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">marxism and judaism that&#39;s why karl marx</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">is a jew</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">the exodus story dominates jewish</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">culture immensely</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">right the three siblings are at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">center they regard the father son spirit</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">the father&#39;s son mother whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">christianity has basically mimicking of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">of the jewish triad so which is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">well my point is like i think the jews</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">jews symbolize the elite and also the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">slave at the same time they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">the elite of the future so</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">you have a small minority they might</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">look oppressed now but they see</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:31.759" style="s2">heroically yeah sure that is why i</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">always said the nietzsche&#39;s mistake was</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.759" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">to make the ubermensch a singular person</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">rather than a group of people which marx</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">did with the proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.839" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">now if you if you leave a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">bullshit marks did you call us as marks</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">and rather marxist or whatever you like</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">let&#39;s not get into that at all let&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s leave marx to kill her or so</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">for us and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">they can do the dirty business of their</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">life whatever they want so we can save</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">the idea of the proletariat the uberman</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">should at least be two</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">because then nietzsche is interested in</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">the savior the sausian</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">the messiah okay uh dan marx was</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">interested in who are the elite who</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">follow</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">the overman so really the over man</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">is the netocratic savior</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">and the proper proletariat that can only</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">now couldn&#39;t have happened before</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">certainly not in lenin&#39;s moscow in 1918</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">uh can only happen now so marxism could</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">eventually be</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">realized as an exodus of an autocratic</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">elite</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">whether they leave physical space and go</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">into something more digital</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">or preferably they because they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">they take digital with them to certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">physical realms like estonia or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">czech republic or</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">or singapore or whatever what they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">do as they please</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what i think is going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">next so we&#39;re going to see the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">of the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">into the digital that could be the title</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">of the book but because we owe so much</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">to hegel and whitehead we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">call the book process an event anyway</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">but you know otherwise so there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">to be an exodus from the elites</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">basically from the netoccrates</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">basically okay so a small minority that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">have a heroic idea of themselves that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">a proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">they&#39;re oppressed but they&#39;re oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">in a sense that that&#39;s okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">oppressed now because we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">rule the world in the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">and this is what we&#39;re going to set</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">about to do it that&#39;s the exact</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">opposite of woke victimhood nothing to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">victim</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s slavery that will be turned</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">into mastery because the slaves are</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">dying to become masters now nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">would love that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">marx would love that white ted hegel</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">would certainly love that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see any reason oh well that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t happen i think that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">likely that we&#39;re going to get the small</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">elite to say that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">okay let&#39;s see the restaurant and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">that elite will then be split into</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">three different sections a symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">natocracy</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">an imaginary autocracy and a real</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">autocasting real resources</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what always happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">with previous power elites during</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">previous paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking for the embryos of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">elite now meaning what we&#39;re doing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">our studies we&#39;re doing paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:05.679" style="s2">embryonism</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">on the population the global population</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.679" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">as a whole now</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:11.440" style="s2">back to the exodus so what is exodus</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">then exodus</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">is the teaching or the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">how to do a proper exodus what does it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">mean to have an authentic fallacy leader</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">in what way does he or she lead or they</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">and who are the elite following the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">leader who perform the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">that then at best can be mimicked</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">by other peoples in the future to also</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">be successful</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">and that process is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">building education</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">okay creating proper leaders yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:46.720" style="s2">through proper</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">archetypal modes so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.720" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">associate according to the persians is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">split</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">between the chieftain and the priest</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">yeah okay meaning mind and body are</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">separated this is the only duality</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:03.880" style="s2">that so raster and is modernism allows</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">meaning the the later gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.880" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">misinterpretation of body mind must be</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">separate so that the mind can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">superior to the body</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">so the mind can be good and body can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">evil would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">awfully strange to sore asthma since he</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">he completely needs you nietzsche was</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">more zoroaster than he ever could have</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:43.360" style="s2">dreamed of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">so that is where i want to base the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.360" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">exodus and that&#39;s why i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">have another ology</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">for the lynch mob i just want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">inverted</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">exodology so we realize exactly what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.000" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a perversion</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">and an inversion of something incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">healthy and wonderful and it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">the worst thing human beings have ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">invented the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">yeah yeah well i it seems like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:07.760" style="s2">living in all these inversions right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.760" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">seems very inverted like i have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">question still though and i brought up</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">the last time and i&#39;m still working on</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">it and that is the concept of the martyr</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">okay yeah maybe thomas has some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">about that i i</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">yeah cause we have scapegoats right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">we have heroes and we have victims and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">and we know the scapegoat is a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">elastic concept there are scapegoats</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">that are just completely innocent</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">being dragged along and thrown in for</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:34.799" style="s2">good measure we have skateboards there</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">are clear objects so</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.799" end="00:21:38.400" style="s2">we found a jew and we&#39;re not so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">kill the jew right um</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.400" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">and we also know this is interesting we</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">also know that we can do whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:46.400" style="s2">want with the scapegoat after we</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">killed him so there&#39;s a cynical way</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">using the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">kingdom sacred cynical way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">but there are different things we can do</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">with the scapegoat we&#39;re basically we</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">basically do</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">free to do whatever we like with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">corpse aren&#39;t we and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">can be turned into a martyr right the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">scapegoat right it can be turned into</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">anything because he can&#39;t defend himself</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">he&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">so uh the usual process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">scapegoating is the scapegoat becomes</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">uh the mar the martyr or the isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">thomas from a girardian point of view no</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.559" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">no let&#39;s see the murderer</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">unless you guys have a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">martyr coming from gerard let&#39;s see the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">murder out for now</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">because the martyr is a very very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">complex phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:28.720" style="s2">and you know blowing my brains out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">the moment about the martyr</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">but the the the to begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">scapegoat can be used because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">corpse and that&#39;s exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">egyptians do when they build the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">exactly it was only after the egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">started building the pyramids the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">persons decided to build the drock bus</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">and the desert basically just put away</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">the corpses and say that a dead person</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">is a dead person is no longer there</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">souls gone so it&#39;s just dead</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">leave it to be eaten by the vultures so</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">we do not build pyramids because they</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">knew</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">that the pyramids would ruin egypt which</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">they did and they would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">they would be the ultimate turning i</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">think the construction of the pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">was the ultimate journey ever so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">preserving a corpse um</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">which which is yeah bound up with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">scapegoat mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">we need to go over where we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">burning something it would mean you you</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">don&#39;t maybe you can jump in here so</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">the idea is that so so you have tensions</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">in the community right</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">so everybody decides the tensions and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">the problems in our community</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">they are the fault of the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">which is some random person that can</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">easily be killed like typically a leper</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.520" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">so the community gets angry at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">scapegoat kills the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">but during the killing there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">orgastic</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">explosion of energy and after the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">killing everybody is suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">relieved and the conflict is gone</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">because they&#39;ve kind of projected</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">everything on that scapegoat right</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">but then the scapegoat is turned into</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">something holy</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s why you have this strange</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">connection between</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">um turn the community turning against an</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">individual killing the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">afterwards that that individual that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">being killed is then turned into a holy</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">sacred object and that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">a very core element of of gerard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">theory right and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">explains a lot of very strange rituals</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">where where kings are for example</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:18.960" style="s2">uh um where where where people are first</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">um um excluded killed and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">turned into objects of uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">of um of uh into religious objects right</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">into uh in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:33.600" style="s2">into uh virtu uh objects of uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">worshipping yeah this is very</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.600" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">interesting because that means this</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">connection between zoroastrianism and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">christianity and two different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">dealing with the scapegoat mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">gerard is of course didn&#39;t studies or</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">astralism</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">so what they did was they just</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">they started to celebrate the paul</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">gazars and persia which is to celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">your memory for 70 years every day you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">died</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">to die the day you died during the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">during the year they would celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">your memory for 70 years if you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">worthy of it right if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">honorable person</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">which was a majority jews do that for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">year you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">yeah or whatever again shared culture so</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">they have obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">influenced the way to do that was they</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">saw to avoiding building the pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">and ruining the economy and the pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">was what they wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:20.400" style="s2">because the pyramids were obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">built to impress so if the dead</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">pharaoh be buried inside the pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">looking at the sun he&#39;d still be alive</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:28.080" style="s2">and he would rule from there or</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">something like that so they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.080" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">avoid that and christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">if gerard is correct dealt with it by</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">just making christ the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">and put him on a cross and once he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">dead he died for all our sins</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">so nobody could no longer die for sins</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">that&#39;s why martyrs get interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">christianity for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">because marcus and christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">obviously do not die for our sins</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">they become role models which christ was</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">not no no no no</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t think so reward gerard has</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:56.400" style="s2">written about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">so one of the characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.400" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">christianity is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">jesus did it for you he did it yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">don&#39;t need to do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the martyrs they expose</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">the the victimized mechanism so they</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">expose the devil so to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">right but they are not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.840" style="s2">persons to copy</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what i said thomas i said</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.840" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">they they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:19.120" style="s2">persons to copy in their behavior there</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">their role models in character</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.120" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">meaning they stayed with the faith even</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">when they were under</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">suffering so so he&#39;s like you can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.559" style="s2">christian</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">look at this guy he stayed with christ</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.559" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">he stayed with christ all the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">he did not die for your sins christ died</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">for his sins</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">well well the martyr is conscious of of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">of what he&#39;s doing uh whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">scapegoat is just a victim</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">right yeah yeah okay we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">christian martyr here so let&#39;s wait</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">yeah the christian martyr knows he he he</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">holds on to the faith and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">the whole time right yeah he&#39;s burnt</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">then he&#39;s burned at the stake whereas</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">the vic the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">the scapegoat is just taken from</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">anywhere and used as</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">a like a leper and right because so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">conscious of what&#39;s the process</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">what&#39;s happening well the thing is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">mechanism that makes you kill a martyr</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">but in christianity the martyr is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">in christianity the scapegoat the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">marcher</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">he&#39;s not a role model about being killed</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">he&#39;s a role model and staying with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">faith yes no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what christianity won he</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">was incredibly i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">it had a huge martyrdom culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">third of the fourth century</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">it was also way more violent and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">territorial than people assume he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.200" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">pacifist at all</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">but what christianity one was that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">people just saw these guys were</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">impressed with them</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">but they weren&#39;t scapegoats and that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">also impressive there must be</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">there must be another mechanism right</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">here because christians knew</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">this was preach everywhere the die</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">christ died for us on the cross and he</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">took on</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">he was later said he took on our sins</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">but that was later thomas is right about</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">but the point was to to to make an end</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">of history an event</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">to the fact that christ was on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">so no other martyrs</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">on the cross could take the place of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">christ on the cross no</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">but the other martyrs could be lesser</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">gods they could become saints in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">christianity which catholicism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">orthodoxy used them for</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">as being look at this guy he he he had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">terrible</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">life he failed the things but he died</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">for his faith</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">he died believing in god all the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">through and therefore if you believe the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">way he believed</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">your sins will be forgiven because of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">christ on the cross we can move forward</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">now zoroastrianism deals with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">differently it wants to get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">scapegoat mechanism for other reasons</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">once we move away from a lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">of a nomadic tribe and moving to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">kind of civilized settlement that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">going to have long periods of peace and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:46.240" style="s2">trade with one another we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">go to war all the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">we can&#39;t have constant lynch mobs in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">streets that&#39;s not a unique</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">insight to early christians or jews that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">it must be a universal insight something</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">that indians and chinese and iranians</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">certainly dealt with too</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">now the way so raster dealt with that to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">get it out of the way that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">michelle is not even a part of swarovski</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">or they don&#39;t believe in sin to begin</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">with is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">he basically said that let&#39;s just put</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">the corpses where they belong just just</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">declare them dead</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">period yeah so you cannot celebrate a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">corpse</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">yeah so literally unclean i&#39;m pure must</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">be thrown out of the community as</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">quickly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">and what they did they built this dork</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">moss and of course when you have desert</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">your vultures around you had vultures to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">eat the corpses and that&#39;s all they did</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">that&#39;s just the corpse and they taught</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">their kids that&#39;s no longer grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a grandfather it&#39;s gone and of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">course in full religion that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">separation</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">of soul from the body but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">part of serastrian teaching in itself in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">zoroastrian teaching in itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">you die when you die like heidegger said</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">and you must live a full life until you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">die hide again again called the harvard</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">and what you leave behind when you die</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">is that everything you achieved in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">life can be used by others to build</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">further civilization from it</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s of course the base of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">persian empire and that&#39;s called amere</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">ancient person for transcendence meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">what is beyond your death it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">not immortality it is you die but</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">through your mortality your life becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">meaningful and precisely because you</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">leave heritage behind for your sons and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">daughters to inherit</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">you made something meaningful out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">your life so you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">death sacred right no exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t and zoroastrianism you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">make death a corpse sacred</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying no acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">so the problem for perhaps with</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">scapegoating is disability or or</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">paganism is this ability to make death</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">sacred and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">exactly so we got the mausoleum of lenin</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">the mausoleum stalin under communism in</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">russia</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">pagan phenomena again we got this you</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">take the fucking corpse it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">pathetic and you&#39;re going there after 40</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">years and the skin&#39;s yolo</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s all good plastic and there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">flies everywhere and it&#39;s just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">keep a corpse alive</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting i want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">thomas about that because</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">when you read girard you get the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">impression that christianity is the only</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">the only thing that&#39;s ever been invented</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">that has been able to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">scapegoat right</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t seem to be true i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">because other cultures like</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:29.039" style="s2">you know zoroastrianism and buddhism had</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">we&#39;re not overrun by the scapegoat right</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.039" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m sure lots of cultures were not</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">and then there are pagan cultures where</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">you know the scapegoat was rampant but</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">obviously these other cultures than</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:41.279" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">had a different way or or of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.279" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">um you know controlling the scapegoat or</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">mechanism this is a very good question</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:50.159" style="s2">and um i still haven&#39;t read the book but</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">gerard has written a book about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.159" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">vedic cultures as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">um it&#39;s about india and so religion in</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">india and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">and so there he he sees he sees similar</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.360" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">patterns also expose exposing the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">victimized mechanism things such as that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">read the book yet but he was aware of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">this problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">and and he was looking at other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">but i agree that it&#39;s a pity that he</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">investigated this more thoroughly um he</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">probably didn&#39;t have time uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">i mean the man of life right but but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">this is very good</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">but i think that that people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">exaggerating this a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">um i think that christianity is without</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">any doubt</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">the most spectacular example of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">exposure of the victim</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">mechanism that i know of buddhism does</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">something else buddhism goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">to the problem of desire because</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">basically the victimized mechanism comes</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">from the problem of desire right</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">and buddhism goes directly to desire but</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t explicitly expose this whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">mechanism like christianity does</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:53.039" style="s2">not in the same way and so rasterism</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">basically is an heroic religion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.039" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">completely phallic</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t allow victimhood at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">within the system</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">so you can&#39;t celebrate victimhood unless</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">you start celebrating drought and if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">celebrate druid</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">you&#39;re a heretic that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">it&#39;s so rasters of adamantly went after</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">the gnostics i mean they&#39;re murdered</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">victimhood outside of christian</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.679" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">influence right because</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">the the whole point is that christianity</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">makes it wrong to kill the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">so so that&#39;s why why we have so</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">basically all these all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">these uh mobs that are so that have</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:28.559" style="s2">so-called concern for the victim</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">uh that&#39;s basically a form of perverted</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">christianity it&#39;s very obvious</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">gerard has also written about this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">exactly because christianity is so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">obsessed with protecting the victim</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.399" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">this has pervaded the entire world so</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">everybody is now super interested in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">protecting the victim</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">and you get a lot of status from</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">protecting the victim this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">a christian idea this would would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">completely incomprehensible to romans</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">for example they would not give a fuck</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">there could be what about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:33:58.399" style="s2">zoroastrians did the zoroastrians give</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">i mean yeah that&#39;s exactly is there</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.399" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">something is there something about</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">christianity that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">this that&#39;s so unique that gerard is</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t have the answer no i</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.039" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">don&#39;t think there were a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">buddhists running around you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know like buddhists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">sacrifice animals or you know well</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:21.440" style="s2">hey cambodia was a buddhist country that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">paul paul took over the 1970s and killed</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">two million of his countrymen so</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">obviously but that was my culture hey</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">unless nobody studied marx in cambodia</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">not a single</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">i said that to provoke you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">yeah no no no no no no no what is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">no i think sherrod is</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">going to say it&#39;s rousseau gerard is on</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">to something very profound here</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">the lynchburg mechanism is universal it</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">belongs to nomadologies it belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">the original universal religions we</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">practice for tens or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">it is it is in our genes it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">we need to deal with constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">i think gerard is absolutely right of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">that and then we can look at cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">studies and sales dealt with and i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:01.839" style="s2">precisely the cultures that are innocent</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:03.359" style="s2">to it and do not have an awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">the scapegoat mechanism and the lynch</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.359" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">bomb otherwise the most vulnerable to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what the maoist cultural</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">revolution killed</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">tens twenties thirties and millions of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">people and cambodia was like two million</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">out of eight million died before paul</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">pogba stopped</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">so i think i think the cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">actually are not aware of this but with</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">the scapegoat mechanism it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">you&#39;re born with</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">oh that&#39;s interesting so maybe buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">was was vulnerable because it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">awareness that&#39;s interesting yeah but i</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">would say that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">i said about christianity and buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">are unique in their own way right</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">i mean buddhism has has has investigated</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">the problem of desire itself to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">to a really great extent where where</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">where because christianity basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:47.359" style="s2">said like you know do not</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">do not follow these these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">because they are dangerous right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">a it&#39;s a very renunciate religion</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">while buddhism kind of says like well</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:57.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">right so sutra is basically renunciation</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.839" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">right renunciation of anger and all</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">these negative things and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">that but then you also have the layer of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">tantra</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">which kind of acknowledges well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">not going to get rid of that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">kind of creatively deal with all these</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">things that that that you would like</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">not to be there yeah that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">that christianity did not develop to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">same extent</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">in my opinion well yeah because i but i</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">also have the intuition that that tantra</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">has very good ways of dealing with with</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.320" style="s2">the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">on some level you know by by enacting it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.320" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">dramatically and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">like there&#39;s another there&#39;s a dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">enactment of uh you know standing on</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">corpses and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">or or or you know drinking alcohol and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">you enact the desires right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">dramatic announcement which</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">frees you from the the this this uh this</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">mob uh sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">you know uh the mob that would go for</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">the scapegoat but by</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">by by acknowledging it and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">yourself and but you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">we got dialectics from the greeks on to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">hegel in the west but he wasn&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">christianity so</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">the dialectical means that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">going to pop up somewhere it doesn&#39;t pop</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">up in your sex life that pop-ups in your</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">social life or somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:12.560" style="s2">you&#39;re just gonna come back to haunt you</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">so you better include it in your</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.560" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">livestream related certainly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">gonna be master of your own destiny you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">have to include it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s uh you know nietzsche is</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">adamant about this so it&#39;s freud and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">that&#39;s because there&#39;s sounds of hegel</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">so that causes together dialectics in</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">the west and obviously that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">that he&#39;s dealt with all along they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">that all along but</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">if if buddhism deals with desire</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">uh it also deals with suffering right</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">and the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">from your own desire and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">suffering is so central to buddhism is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">of course the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">card because so much of life is</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">and if you can deal with suffering</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">without turning you into victim whereas</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">the people you envy do not suffer which</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">then just fosters another lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">so you must in buddhism declare that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.520" style="s2">suffering is universal</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">otherwise there&#39;s those who suffer and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.520" end="00:38:03.599" style="s2">those who do not and if that happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">then you get exactly the sort of class</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.599" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">revenge is some or or a group revenges</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">that dominates our culture today</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">yeah because if you can declare that i</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">suffer uh i&#39;ve chose to suffer</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">i declare that i suffer and i am the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">only one allowed to do that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">speak against me and you don&#39;t suffer</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t suffer</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">you take whatever i want away from you</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">there is suffering is the statement of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">buddhism there is suffering it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">um yeah it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t point the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">finger of suffering and also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:40.079" style="s2">three other</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">aspects to that that&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">just the beginning right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">people take that as the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">right but it&#39;s just uh nobody</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">experienced why buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">zoroastrianism gels so well against our</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">asthma</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">gels well with others because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">exclusively deals with certain things</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:54.760" style="s2">it deals with the heroic it deals with</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:56.000" style="s2">the phallic it is a building</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.760" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.000" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what zoroastrianism deals</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">with and it doesn&#39;t claim to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">it claims to be the first universal</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">religion in the sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">universal religion for an elite</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">nobody assumed that you would have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">universal religion that all human beings</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">on the planet would inherit to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">3700 years ago no you declared a certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">teaching</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">along the trade routes that people were</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">allowed to follow and if they did so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">promised they&#39;d probably be successful</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">right okay that&#39;s where zoroastrian</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">comes in that&#39;s exactly what zoroastrian</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:24.640" style="s2">is also the birth of universal human</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">rights</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">because they differentiated between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">elite religion that they eventually</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">divided into the priesthood religion and</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">the military religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">mithraism and zurbanism and they had a</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">false religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">which like well you can worship whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">you like you&#39;re all going to worship</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">idols and celebrities and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">or at best christian saints much better</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">role models than jimi hendrix to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">honest about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">so the the the idea the lesser gods was</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">there in christianity at least the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">catholicism and orthodoxy it escaped the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">protestants that&#39;s exactly because they</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">were they were essentially cartesians</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:57.520" style="s2">they&#39;re not christians</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">but he was there in catholicism and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.520" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">orthodox and it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">but looking at differently comparing</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">that the magical</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">the very feminine power of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">buddhism is something they share</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">and they did so apparently by buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">claiming that we know about suffering</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">and we deal with suffering so we also</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">deal with the origin of suffering which</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">is desire itself</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">that makes sense there are no</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">mythological concerns that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">normatological religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:22.359" style="s2">what christianity had to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">though was that it came out of an</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.359" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">eventological landscape</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">since the sarasota side invented</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">christianity islam also logical</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">religions linear time or incredibly</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:58.800" style="s2">is it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">when these systems then collide</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">without knowing about each other which</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">would happen when western eventology</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">suddenly boom got into east asia in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">1960s and 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">these societies incredibly vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:14.480" style="s2">i mean it wouldn&#39;t be too hard if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">a tyrant to say that you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.480" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">suffering and by the way there are some</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">people who don&#39;t if people are told that</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">suffering is universal and you say but</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">there are some people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re called capitalists now</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">there&#39;s not much of a tweak that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">needed by mao to actually say that right</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">and that becomes maoism</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">so i think we&#39;re at our most vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">we leave history in our own culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">and we don&#39;t no longer understand and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">haven&#39;t got a clue</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">of what we&#39;re approaching and then we</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">step right into it and then we cause</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">think we get to have what we currently</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">fundamentally understand in eventually</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">i think chirag is definitely in the</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">since he bases this on one scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">could forever change</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:00.280" style="s2">the landscapes of scapegoat will no</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">longer be needed that is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.280" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">eventological change to a nomadological</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">conviction</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">the normal logical conviction being if</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:09.440" style="s2">you only find somebody to blame things</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">on we can get release and tensions out</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.440" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">of the way and we can move on and have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">period of peace until the next build</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">tension is built up now if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:17.760" style="s2">convinced that&#39;s the case if the shamans</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">are convinced that the case</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.760" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">the sooner or later we&#39;ll have to find</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:22.560" style="s2">the scapegoat and the scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">mechanism has to be in place</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.560" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">if you believe in homology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">probably you would see so up</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">i&#39;d expect chiron studies of india would</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">find that still to be the case in india</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">whereas with christianity because it</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:35.040" style="s2">inherited</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">from zoroastrianism and judaism the idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.040" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">of eventology</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">it could come up with the idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">somebody dies on the cross we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:43.839" style="s2">reinterpret that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">as it&#39;s the end of the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.839" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">mechanism and see if we can make that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:49.760" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">yeah then it&#39;s interesting to look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.760" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">the persian perspective of christ on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">cross</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">so the persian perspective is of the two</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">celestions i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.119" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">through this before but it&#39;s part again</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">of the social theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">which is the opposite of the tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">theory this ocean&#39;s precursor needed a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">thomas and i&#39;ve been talking about it we</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">eventually settled for the word hyperjet</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">i love the word superject but</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">unfortunately whitehead has already</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">claimed that and he uses it for his</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">subjectivity so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">the white hidden subject is called the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">superjet which is perfect the hyperjet</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">is the precursor to the savior</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">so the hyperjet is somebody who just</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">speaks up against the mob to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">says the voice</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">the voice of recent truth opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:33.040" style="s2">mob</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">you said there has to be two when it</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.040" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">appears</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">the hype the on object is one voice and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">then the tolerance steps forward okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">could be one or two whatever uh but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:45.359" style="s2">we&#39;re probably likely to just the priest</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:48.000" style="s2">and the uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.359" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">uh the priest and the the warrior again</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.000" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">interesting this is where it gets</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">interesting high projection what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:55.599" style="s2">higher projection then</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.680" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">high projection is basically looking</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.599" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">into the future and said</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">where are we actually going what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">could the impossible be possible where</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">is the promised land how do we get out</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">of the current mess out of the current</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">and walk towards our desire which is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">promised land okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:13.839" style="s2">how do we do that well you need an error</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.319" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">under moses you need a priest</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">what does the priest do he creates the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">narrative there is a promised land</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">the promised land is full of milk and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">honey if we just leave everything else</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">behind and we focus</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">on that one spot the name of that spot</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">is god</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">and we walk towards god we will arrive</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">at the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">now next that is the chieftain he</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">personifies the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">he steps forward and says that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">personify this</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">and i step up against the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">which is moses case was that i will take</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">you with me and leave egypt towards the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">promised land</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">and of course the lynch mob in the bible</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:49.440" style="s2">is of course in the pharaoh regrets that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">he let the hebrews leave</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.440" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">and he puts himself on a horse and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">come storming down</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">and the red sea opens and the hebrews</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">can walk through</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">speaking of rebirth and then the red sea</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">closes and drowns the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">that clearly is the jewish lands bob the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">jewish leadership obviously egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">will go after the hebrews and try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">kill them</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">yeah so there you go with the learnings</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">that&#39;s how the use deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">national mechanism is just not us</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">we should be educated sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:17.760" style="s2">enough in the jewish population</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">not to go into scapegoat mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">right and that&#39;s how we stay away from</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">it because it&#39;s something others do but</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:23.119" style="s2">we do not</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">because we&#39;re a nation and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.119" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">superior that would be the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">version of it now the sorested version</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">of that would be that well</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">actually there are two different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">being associated if</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">you&#39;re so damn successful you actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">go against the lynch mob and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">yeah and then you become a heroic</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">sergeant</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">and you win and then you retire</p>

<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">the purchase he was the person</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:54.720" style="s2">with alexander the great was of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">by the greeks at least declared</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">these great heroes military heroes etc</p>

<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:07.359" style="s2">but what&#39;s interesting with the person</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">is they would admit</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.359" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">that if the session fails he speaks the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.480" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">he speaks osha but the mob of drouge</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">go after him anyway and kill him</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">that would be the person saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">what do we do then well they put him on</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">a cross</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">and he died okay let&#39;s use that since</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:28.400" style="s2">we&#39;re free to use the corpse any way we</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.400" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">let&#39;s use that as a story that says that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">why don&#39;t we make</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:37.839" style="s2">this killing of the savior himself</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.680" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">the hero was killed by us we kill the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.839" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">hero what do we make that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">ultimate learning lesson that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">learn a little bit less we need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">that this was never happened again</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you have a connection</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">with jesus and christianity so</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">righteousness don&#39;t have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">christianity did you say</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">yeah they they they made their bet on</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">the second session as if he was the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">final sergeant we don&#39;t we still think</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">the first ocean can come</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">i think i think these two versions are</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:04.240" style="s2">perfectly compatible with each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">would you agree i i don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.240" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">because basically okay so so christ</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.319" style="s2">dying is basically well it exposes this</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">let&#39;s not go there but anything else is</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">basically open right that&#39;s why gerard</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:21.119" style="s2">also emphasizes that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.319" style="s2">the bible ends with the apocalypse which</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.119" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">is this very</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.319" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">strange text very psychedelic right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">not exactly clear what it&#39;s about but it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">basically means that if you remove this</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">victimage mechanism you are in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">because this victimish mechanism works</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">yeah just keep the community calm oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">hell breaks loose sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">before you get to the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">right for 2 000</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">years we have seen the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">victimh mechanism now it&#39;s suddenly back</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">because the internet brings everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">and makes everything basically very</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">egalitarian societies where everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">uh connected they&#39;re actually very</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">vulnerable to the victimization</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">mechanism and we&#39;ve killed christianity</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:01.200" style="s2">as nietzsche said we would we have done</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.200" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">no we have killed christianity so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">don&#39;t have the christians</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">it seems collapse of christianity that</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">is something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what you what you expect</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">because basically this now the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">victimization mechanism has really</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">so there&#39;s no more burning of jews</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">there&#39;s no more burning of witches so</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">that kept to a certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">that sacrificial part of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">that kept that together</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s all gone now so now we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">uh space where christianity cannot use</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:31.280" style="s2">the victimized mechanisms anymore to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">promote</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">this sacrificial form of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">and now basically the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">what next what are we going to do now</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">well we&#39;re killing we&#39;re killing sex</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">workers and drug addicts all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">people in our society and a lot of old</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">people too because the coronavirus at</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">the moment but it&#39;s more and more</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">difficult right</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">no i don&#39;t say it&#39;s more difficult i</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">think we just moved the scapegoat to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">and make somebody else this doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:58.559" style="s2">anymore because there&#39;s no unanimity</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">you can still i mean you can still go</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.559" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">after scapegoats but it&#39;s you do not</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">unite the tribe anymore</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">not everybody buys this anymore very few</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">people actually buy this most people</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">don&#39;t speak up but</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">nobody believes this story that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">this guy was completely guilty there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not very believable anymore</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">certainly not among philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">thinkers and stuff like that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">that train has gone so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s still operating it&#39;s so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:31.119" style="s2">still unconsciously operating</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">you know all over the place and probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.119" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">i&#39;d be careful to say it&#39;s gone since a</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.800" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">pagan religious nazism plundered the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">planet only 50 years ago and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">killed</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">millions of jews and gypsies and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.720" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">everything so it i i&#39;ll be careful to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">say it&#39;s gone already now</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re tired of it and aware of it to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">the extent thomas&#39;s claims</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t think so i don&#39;t think well you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">mentioned the apocalypse and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">apocalypse has to come first and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">you you get to the promised land or</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">something right</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">so what wait a second nothing has to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">fall apart though</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">the whole thing just falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">completely and that&#39;s what this is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">return of christ psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">weird andrew there&#39;s the return of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">christ you can&#39;t complete christianity</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">without i don&#39;t know if she wrote us a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:11.040" style="s2">theory on it sherrod is not the only</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">christian after all i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">and and after apocalypse christ returns</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">so this time around christ is the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">socio even christianity claims he has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">come back as the winner</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s either another person or</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">somebody else taking the role but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">certainly the proper savior who comes</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">back well the jews which are</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">such say that the christos kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">moves</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">through different different saviors</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">right and christ was sort of one of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">the cristos would move to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not the man they say it&#39;s the wine</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not the wine skin but the the wine</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">right um yeah the principle it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">personal principle</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">no there are there are prophets who</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">probably qualify for being saints or</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">martyrs or being savers or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">their prophets have that quality</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who just</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">happened to walk by and they said a few</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">and very little was remembered and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">somebody else wrote the book about them</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">afterwards claiming they said things</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">they never said</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">muhammad didn&#39;t write a word he still</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">apparently authored the quran</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how that happened right</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">probably a person wrote it not an arab</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">to begin with right</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">so you know we claim things afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">and attribute them to the corpses okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">human history is full of attribution</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">given to corpses</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">let&#39;s admit that we should even go into</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">maybe in details</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">to find out what kind of attributions do</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">we give to corpses</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">sometimes we cherish them sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">just you know they go to pains decline</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:28.559" style="s2">them evil</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.119" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">sometimes we blame things on them so we</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.559" end="00:51:30.400" style="s2">don&#39;t need to take care of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:32.960" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.400" end="00:51:35.359" style="s2">all kinds of things we we we know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.960" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">corpses do not speak back</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a great insight that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">universal that&#39;s why they&#39;re useful or</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:42.319" style="s2">you know that&#39;s why they can&#39;t be used</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">or at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.319" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">at least to the defense or astronautism</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:48.160" style="s2">they they realize that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">let&#39;s just at least force people to only</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.160" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">memorize who they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">and maybe the more truthful rather than</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">celebrating the corpses themselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s the partition of mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">and body does happen at death</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:03.760" style="s2">um mind is collective anyway if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">collective might talk about rather than</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.760" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">individual mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">then certainly mind survives as the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">collective anyway it&#39;s their language of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">memory and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:13.839" style="s2">but the body is literally dead in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">case the mind is connected to the body</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:15.440" style="s2">which is of course your own</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.440" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">then it&#39;s certainly over the sauron&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">never claimed anything else they never</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">believed anything else they didn&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:23.119" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why even if they were</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">wealthy successful they never built</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.119" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">their tombs were very small and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:28.240" style="s2">locked up their corpses and that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">only of the kings</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.240" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">the mobets themselves were thrown into</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">the deserts so the door kumas were</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">developed not originally</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">they were developed later as a response</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">to the egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:41.280" style="s2">building of the pyramids and it was of</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">course economically credibly smart if</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.280" end="00:52:44.960" style="s2">you&#39;re going to run an empire not spend</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">any more time on corpses</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">once people are dead just get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">them may i may i jump in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">i want to come back to about uh you</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">mentioned the nazis right you said like</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:55.839" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">the victim edge mechanism isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.839" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">take for example the nazis</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">very very true excellent example of</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:04.000" style="s2">basically a</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">an outbreak of of rampant paganism but</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what you expect because</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">if you dismantle</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">the victimage mechanism as coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">organized religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">right then it will come out in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">disorganized way that&#39;s why we now have</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">these mobs</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">online mobs of all kinds of all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:20.960" style="s2">sorts and shapes</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we had nazism because</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">basically the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">the pagan mechanisms that are in us you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">know every</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">in us all they are not regulated anymore</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">by religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">so they&#39;re just everywhere suddenly they</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">just break out that&#39;s the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">normally the pagan mob would be would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">guided by</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">by pagan religion so yes we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">kill people but we&#39;re gonna kill the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">right person at the right time in a good</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">ritual even the greek</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:49.760" style="s2">did that you know the pharmacom which</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">you uh which you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.760" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">uh a couple of episodes ago right the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">greek they kept slaves</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:57.920" style="s2">that they sometimes would kill the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">civilized greek right</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.920" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">so and and so so basically they they</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:04.240" style="s2">acknowledged that paganism</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:06.400" style="s2">but they made sure that it was regulated</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">but christianity basically dismantled it</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.400" end="00:54:10.319" style="s2">decoupled it from religion</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">but of course that mechanism is still in</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.319" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">us so we know it&#39;s wrong and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">want to go there and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">for 2000 years we&#39;ve seen that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">a very destructive way of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">but we go there again and again we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">help ourselves and that&#39;s the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why we live in a secular society</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:27.680" style="s2">as the apocalypse that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">kind of interesting huh because we would</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.680" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s it it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:33.680" style="s2">being advertised to be the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.680" end="00:54:38.160" style="s2">it could be some kind of liberation from</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">from religion but uh so</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.160" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">wrong but uh very wrong oh nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">said that all andrew you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:46.799" style="s2">you said that too yeah needs to say that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">all along andrew you can&#39;t forget about</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.799" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:51.359" style="s2">forget about the new york times said we</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">don&#39;t even discuss shit like that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.359" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">talk about nietzsche for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">nietzsche nietzsche said you&#39;ve killed</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">god and you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.079" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">you will regret it and he caught blood</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">everywhere wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:04.319" style="s2">millions of corpses and now what he sees</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:14.319" style="s2">if anything we&#39;re seeing today this is</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">on it&#39;s gonna get worse you got joker</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">zombie yeah yeah yeah yeah tyrants</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">post-modernism right i mean i mean i&#39;m i</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">very much uh worthwhile to study</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">thinkers like the laws and focus and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">stuff like that are not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:55.839" style="s2">be very simplistic about it but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">the pop interpretations of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.839" end="00:55:58.400" style="s2">post-modernism i think that&#39;s the last</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.400" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">embodied yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.599" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">why spinosa without hegel gets so</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">destructive</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s where it comes from explain okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">so if you take spinoza seriously and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">see his weaknesses you discover that</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">spinosa</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:19.119" style="s2">insists that the world is one</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">but because there is different he then</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.119" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">just subtly attributes that to really</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">attribute to the attributes he just</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">basically says that tons of attributes</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:28.319" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t explain how the the one and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">the attributes</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.319" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">collaborate with one another how they</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">function in relation to one another</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">because nothing can be infinite</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:38.319" style="s2">unless it is everything in in any system</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">because otherwise it isn&#39;t infinite</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.319" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">so so you&#39;ve got lots of problems with</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:43.839" style="s2">spinosa can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:44.720" style="s2">imalicant actually is the great critic</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.839" end="00:56:47.599" style="s2">of spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.720" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">he tears him apart he tears apart that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.599" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">shit</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">and after that spinoza is wonderful as</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">an inspiration to study monism</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">he&#39;s certainly wonderful as an</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">inspiration to study how you can put</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:56:59.119" style="s2">attributes into the monastic universe</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">but at the end of the day the universe</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">does exist of different things for</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">example a rock and human consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">are very different things</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not just attributes we talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:08.960" style="s2">about we talk about as emergence vectors</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">in our theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.960" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a radically radical spheres that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">are separated from one another although</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">they belong to the same neutrally modest</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">this is all very complex being also</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t really go into the complex of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">but spin also lacks dialectics again he</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:25.119" style="s2">lacks a dialectical understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.119" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">this of course is what hegel&#39;s critique</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">was being also hegel allowed spinoza as</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:31.520" style="s2">we should</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:33.359" style="s2">but then said but there&#39;s tons of shit</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.520" end="00:57:34.960" style="s2">lacking in spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">and one of them is that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.960" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">understand dialectics rather than</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">pantheism which is what spinosa features</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.160" end="00:57:45.520" style="s2">then hegel creates pan-dialecticism</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">meaning that everything both physical</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.520" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">biological and mental whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">dialectical fundamentally dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s been proven right again and</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">again and again and again that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a great hegelian renaissance the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">g-shape there&#39;s adrian johnston there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:57.119" style="s2">people like me who read hegel all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.119" end="00:58:01.520" style="s2">we love hegel and i think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:04.319" style="s2">concept of the negativity or something</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.520" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">no no negativity negation being certain</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:08.319" style="s2">an enormous difference you must not</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">ever ever use positive and negativity</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.319" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">when you talk about dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">nation negation is like buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">emptiness somehow and then that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">yes that allows the whole system to</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.359" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">become fluid and alive rather than being</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">you know realified monism or</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">this is exactly okay so hegel is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">finishing difficult but brilliant beyond</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:28.160" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:29.359" style="s2">so you read hegel through whitehead if</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.160" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">you&#39;re smart today you read</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.359" end="00:58:32.720" style="s2">whitehead through hegel and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">probably the two most</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.720" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">interesting spheres you could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">study today if you do philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">now that excludes binosa why</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">because hegel took kant&#39;s criticism spin</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">also seriously and moved on and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:48.720" style="s2">put a proper dialectics into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">universe so that means that hegel what</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.720" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">people constantly forget is also</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">modest there&#39;s only one universe but</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">what he realized is this universe</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:56.720" style="s2">operates dialectically</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">everything operates dialectically which</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.720" end="00:58:59.760" style="s2">then he solves all the problems fit also</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">left behind</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:04.400" style="s2">now the problem is that in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:07.119" style="s2">people were hippies right</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:08.880" style="s2">now hippies influenced thinking and art</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.119" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">and everything way more than we assumed</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.880" end="00:59:11.359" style="s2">because a lot of people want to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">trendy and cool and fashionable</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.359" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">these were like bad monists no so</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:17.520" style="s2">post-modernists are always people to end</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:19.599" style="s2">up with turtlenecks in art galleries</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.520" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">aren&#39;t they discussing philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.599" end="00:59:24.000" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like the germans in in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">saturday night live show in america the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.000" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">1980s there were like turtlenecks and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">had a german accent and they were</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">dancing</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">funny coughed walkish dance in berlin</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">and they were you&#39;re blaming that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.839" style="s2">ultimately on spinoza i mean no no</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">no i&#39;m blaming no i&#39;m blaming the</p>

<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">i was the first hippie or something no</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">wait is it i&#39;m blaming the spin assist</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.640" end="00:59:44.480" style="s2">revival</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:46.240" style="s2">that we saw with the lures in the 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.480" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">and with postmodernism</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.240" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">i&#39;m saying that we cannot read spinosa</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:52.480" style="s2">and ignore</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">kante lenix who came after him because</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.480" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">what these guys are doing is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">they&#39;re going back to spinoz and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">pretending</p>

<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">right the the revolution of khan changed</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:08.400" style="s2">his philosophy forever at least in the</p>

<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">we saw red traces of it before these but</p>

<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:15.280" style="s2">and you cannot re you cannot not read</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">now what hegel did was that he then he</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:22.720" style="s2">then turned count against himself by</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.160" end="01:00:24.559" style="s2">saying that</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:26.480" style="s2">the con separation of the numeral of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.559" end="01:00:27.839" style="s2">phenomenon is kind of ridiculous too</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">we might as well move everything into</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.839" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">the phenomenological pharmacological to</p>

<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:34.319" style="s2">because dengan seiko is removed by hegel</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">which is fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.319" end="01:00:38.880" style="s2">so hegel introduces process philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">to the west</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.880" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">through dialectics the pan dialecticism</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">of hegel is the pan organicism</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:50.319" style="s2">awaited and avoid pan psychism at all</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">costs because pan psychism is</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.319" end="01:00:56.079" style="s2">essentially what spinoza is</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">so pan psychism where does that appear</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.079" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">in france in the 1960s and in california</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">in california the 1960s culturally in</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">in france in the 1960s more</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:10.319" style="s2">philosophically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">and these two then blended and one</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.319" end="01:01:12.960" style="s2">worship was exported across the atlantic</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">to america</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.960" end="01:01:16.079" style="s2">and became pomo and the other ones</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">exported back to europe became</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.079" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:19.680" style="s2">you know the guys the art colors of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">turtlenecks you know the pretentious</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.680" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">philosophers that i always disliked in</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.599" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.240" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s pomo and pomo is</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">to a large extent vulgar spinal system</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.680" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">vulgar in the sense that it&#39;s too close</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:33.599" style="s2">to spinoza&#39;s original teachings</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">without taking content hagel seriously</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.599" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.760" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">that i&#39;ve never heard about the sling</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:41.280" style="s2">between spinoza and uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:43.359" style="s2">and post-modernism i i know that count</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.280" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">and post-modernism have been linked but</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.359" end="01:01:46.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">no no not at all no can&#39;t no they fight</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.960" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">with kant all the time today it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:52.079" style="s2">speculative realism it&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">dominant mode for the past 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.079" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">and graham harman and all these guys are</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:57.200" style="s2">into speculative realism</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.000" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">and they also believe they can get</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">beyond kant by going back to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">pre-conscience</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:02.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they can at all you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">go back to the pre-content it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.319" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">we know that the moment of the phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:09.440" style="s2">are always separated but so what</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:10.160" style="s2">what is the new part you do know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.440" end="01:02:13.440" style="s2">white hat</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.160" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">both white hat and heidegger basically</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.440" end="01:02:18.000" style="s2">their uh their program is to to get the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">phenomenon and the nominee</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.000" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">to get that idea out of the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.079" end="01:02:28.720" style="s2">come on very much uh how do you get the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:30.480" style="s2">kind of agreement with this country</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.720" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">heidegger becomes a german country point</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.480" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">when he tries to do that you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:33.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to go through the hegel in</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.839" end="01:02:37.119" style="s2">that case okay heidegger does it better</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">when he just imitates angle</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.119" end="01:02:40.160" style="s2">but what what you do is that you move</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:41.680" style="s2">into phenomenology period and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.160" end="01:02:43.280" style="s2">what hegel did and then he realized</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.680" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">everything is dialectical you can go</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.280" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">back and then study</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">science and mathematics and logos how</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">much as you like and discover is</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">dialectical too</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">everything changes all the time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:02:54.559" style="s2">fundamental right</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">so without going too much into those</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.559" end="01:02:58.799" style="s2">details i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">i think we need to if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.799" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">criticize the lust at its weakest points</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">and the last is the one i will say</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:07.200" style="s2">lockhart is not part of homo lacon is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:08.799" style="s2">hegelian through and through let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.200" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">the khan of the big that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.799" end="01:03:12.240" style="s2">people like me and shishek and johnston</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:13.760" style="s2">are reading lacan reading hegel and</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.240" end="01:03:14.160" style="s2">we&#39;re reading gerard and we really need</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:16.640" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.160" end="01:03:18.640" style="s2">but if pomo was just a vulgarization a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.640" end="01:03:21.039" style="s2">pop philosophy of some kind appearing in</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.640" end="01:03:22.480" style="s2">the 1970s and france and america</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.039" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">will we have promised it for cohen to</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.480" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">lose certainly with the later demons</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.039" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">certainly with the latest the lesser</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:29.520" style="s2">guadalee they hate</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">i think they&#39;re bringing it back like</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.520" end="01:03:33.839" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a parody of nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">i mean even the way they write right i</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.839" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">mean i&#39;m reading derrida now which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:38.079" style="s2">great i mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">reading a sacred text it&#39;s like reading</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.079" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">the bible they got that from nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">also was practical he was the guy who</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:46.559" style="s2">started this this tradition</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:48.319" style="s2">and so a lot of post-modernism i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.559" end="01:03:49.920" style="s2">i like reading these these texts in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.319" end="01:03:51.440" style="s2">sense that you know i&#39;m very at home i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.920" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">i&#39;m used to reading long champa and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.440" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:56.839" style="s2">these guys are writing uh secular sacred</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">texts</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.839" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">and they never read hegel properly they</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.359" end="01:04:09.839" style="s2">read hegel through hippolyte or kojav</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">only indirectly well jeff yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.839" end="01:04:14.240" style="s2">yeah that means that the lastest</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">critique of hegel is his weakest point</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">and the problem is that he disguises it</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:19.760" style="s2">with spidosa worship</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.760" end="01:04:21.599" style="s2">so that means he he goes for espinosa</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">without hegel hager wrote a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.599" end="01:04:24.400" style="s2">spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">hegel had a fellow called shelling and</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.400" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">shouting was</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">who was then converted into hegelian</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:31.280" style="s2">during his own lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:32.480" style="s2">if you read the older shelling you go</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.280" end="01:04:34.400" style="s2">back to the younger shelling you see</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.480" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">enormous differences between the two</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.400" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">so shelling was the spinosist after kant</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.760" end="01:04:40.480" style="s2">who tried to go back to spinoza and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">escape kant when he&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.480" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">philosophia</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:45.520" style="s2">hagen knew that was impossible laughter</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:47.520" style="s2">said no kant made a revolution let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.520" end="01:04:49.440" style="s2">even dig even deeper</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.520" end="01:04:51.440" style="s2">and let&#39;s turn kant against khan what</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:53.520" style="s2">would kanta said about khan critically</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.440" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s where hegel moved wonderfully</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.520" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">in the early 1800s with his amazing</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.680" end="01:04:59.039" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:00.720" style="s2">he&#39;s still the greatest guy i just have</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:02.720" style="s2">a question i want to try to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.720" end="01:05:04.240" style="s2">if we can bring this back to the lynch</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.720" end="01:05:07.359" style="s2">mob idea a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.240" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">okay are you are you are you</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.359" end="01:05:14.079" style="s2">connecting a false reading of spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.280" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">like to to let&#39;s say to the 60s america</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.079" end="01:05:18.000" style="s2">and to the postmodernist</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:19.599" style="s2">and to the present lynch mob situation</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.839" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">call it vulgar spinner system and vulgar</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.920" end="01:05:29.200" style="s2">spinner system is just</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:31.760" style="s2">pop philosophy that hasn&#39;t studied this</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.200" end="01:05:34.000" style="s2">shit that&#39;s california new h2</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.760" end="01:05:36.079" style="s2">oh everything is united with everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.000" end="01:05:37.920" style="s2">okay the world is one</p>

<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you get if you read</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.599" end="01:06:43.280" style="s2">spinoza too literally</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">and believe he speaks directly to you</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.280" end="01:06:46.640" style="s2">and your little spider&#39;s a genius</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">and you&#39;re not actually reading the</p>

<p begin="01:07:13.680" end="01:07:18.000" style="s2">yeah okay so he does dialectics and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:19.039" style="s2">he&#39;s seriously considering the</p>

<p begin="01:07:24.880" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">so the unity this sort of romantic unity</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:32.559" style="s2">of spinoza&#39;s universe</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">disappears also spinosus is god has a</p>

<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:39.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no wealth to power in spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:40.000" style="s2">you will don&#39;t will anything andrew i</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.440" end="01:07:41.839" style="s2">don&#39;t wield</p>

<p begin="01:07:41.839" end="01:07:46.559" style="s2">and this idea of a sort of passive</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:48.160" style="s2">subjectivity that just floats around</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.559" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">here and there</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.160" end="01:07:51.920" style="s2">damasio used to be spinoses but he</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:53.760" style="s2">turned against but also interestingly</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.920" end="01:07:54.240" style="s2">enough of the 2010s that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.760" end="01:07:56.400" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.240" end="01:07:57.920" style="s2">how he started saying no no no the</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.400" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">vulgar spinner system wasn&#39;t what i</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.920" end="01:08:01.200" style="s2">meant with spinosa being back in fashion</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:02.880" style="s2">and rereading spin also that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.200" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">idea if you&#39;re a competitive scientist</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:06.079" style="s2">the demacia&#39;s too smart for that he</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:08.640" style="s2">turned against that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.079" end="01:08:11.280" style="s2">contingency in the universe of spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.640" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">so basically there is there is there is</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.280" end="01:08:14.559" style="s2">god that knows everything the past and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">the future that means that there is no</p>

<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:18.719" style="s2">there&#39;s no real contingency if you would</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.359" end="01:08:20.719" style="s2">run the universe if you stop the</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.719" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">universe here you would run it again so</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.719" end="01:08:23.440" style="s2">to speak then you would get the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">outcome there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:27.359" style="s2">it could not be otherwise so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:28.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the the block universe of spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.359" end="01:08:29.279" style="s2">and it&#39;s the universe of einstein as</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.799" end="01:08:32.480" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.279" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">einstein it is yeah it is is but but</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.480" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">can you see also in the vulgarized</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:36.159" style="s2">version how attractive that is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">hippies</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.159" end="01:08:38.560" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to commit themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.279" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">anything because it takes an effort to</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.560" end="01:08:41.600" style="s2">make a commitment</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:43.120" style="s2">oh yeah accept what is and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.600" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">that yeah yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.120" end="01:08:46.880" style="s2">and and all this there&#39;s a lack of i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:47.279" style="s2">getting a lack of masculinity too i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.880" end="01:08:48.960" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.279" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">oh totally you&#39;re getting a lack of</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.960" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">energy uh in in the uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:58.960" style="s2">okay so nietzsche&#39;s response to that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.199" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">of course will the power</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.960" end="01:09:02.960" style="s2">yeah okay the way to do that take it</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:04.400" style="s2">seriously now is to divide will to power</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.960" end="01:09:06.480" style="s2">again split phallus into world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.400" end="01:09:08.480" style="s2">intelligence will the transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.480" end="01:09:09.679" style="s2">and because machines will not have will</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.480" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">to transcend us they&#39;ll own their</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.679" end="01:09:12.159" style="s2">world&#39;s intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">we can make the machines operate</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">beautifully for the priests but at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:18.719" style="s2">same time we achieve chance actually god</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.920" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">lead and create society as a work of art</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">and that would cry</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">require without transcendence this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">way away from spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:29.120" style="s2">and this is where de la struggles with</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:30.080" style="s2">dominology and everything he did in his</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.120" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">last 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.080" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">in that actually if there was a delusion</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:37.520" style="s2">yeah he could be interesting for</p>

<p begin="01:09:37.520" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">or whatever but but if you&#39;re gonna if</p>

<p begin="01:15:38.000" end="01:15:41.440" style="s2">but the precursor is the guy who steps</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">up against the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.440" end="01:15:47.520" style="s2">so john the baptist&#39;s head on the plate</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:49.040" style="s2">is clearly a precursor to the messiah in</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.520" end="01:15:53.120" style="s2">christian mythology</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.040" end="01:15:55.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s why the hyperdect</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.120" end="01:15:59.520" style="s2">is where i&#39;m going next in my studies to</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.840" end="01:15:59.520" style="s2">conclude the exodus</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.239" end="01:16:04.640" style="s2">and then the priest if you&#39;re the first</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.480" end="01:16:05.760" style="s2">saw sound like moses you don&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.640" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">the promised land</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.760" end="01:16:09.600" style="s2">almost symbolically you switch from</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:10.560" style="s2">first to second solution by dying before</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.600" end="01:16:12.400" style="s2">you enter the promised land</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.560" end="01:16:13.920" style="s2">but you do send the chieftain into the</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.400" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">promised land because he&#39;s the physical</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.920" end="01:16:16.719" style="s2">guy actually leads them into the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:18.159" style="s2">promised land because for you the</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.719" end="01:16:18.960" style="s2">journey was the only thing that was</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.159" end="01:16:21.360" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.960" end="01:16:22.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s typical for celsius for the</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.360" end="01:16:24.320" style="s2">celsius</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.159" end="01:16:25.920" style="s2">his only interest is to complete his</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.320" end="01:16:28.159" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.920" end="01:16:29.280" style="s2">and his work is to stop the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.159" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">and make people realize</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.280" end="01:16:33.440" style="s2">this is a fantastic golden opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:35.040" style="s2">in history to do exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.440" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">thing of lynch mobbing</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.040" end="01:16:38.480" style="s2">which is to leave the lynch mob get out</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.920" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.480" end="01:16:42.159" style="s2">and walk in the opposite direction into</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:44.960" style="s2">the promised land and be heroic</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.159" end="01:16:45.280" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s why i&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.960" end="01:16:47.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.280" end="01:16:48.400" style="s2">phallic because the phallic is</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.280" end="01:16:50.719" style="s2">ultimately what is</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:53.120" style="s2">lacking today not even religion but</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.719" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">phallic religion itself is lacking and</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.120" end="01:16:57.120" style="s2">that&#39;s where i want to work</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re completing our trilogy</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.120" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">with the exodus</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.480" end="01:17:05.120" style="s2">first synthesis yeah we have the false</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">dionysian right</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.120" end="01:17:08.480" style="s2">oh we have that still yeah the falston</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:10.560" style="s2">has an end authentic dynasty</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.480" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">or basically it&#39;s the kick that you get</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.560" end="01:17:14.320" style="s2">from joining the mop right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:14.960" style="s2">this dionysian feeling that&#39;s this you</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.320" end="01:17:18.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.960" end="01:17:20.480" style="s2">the the the frenzy of the kill now</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.000" end="01:17:21.040" style="s2">via facebook right i mean look i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.480" end="01:17:23.120" style="s2">this i</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.040" end="01:17:24.640" style="s2">wrote this first i got him so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.120" end="01:17:26.320" style="s2">this dionysian feeling but it&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.640" end="01:17:27.840" style="s2">course the fake dionysian right this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">kind of like a very</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.840" end="01:17:32.159" style="s2">very bleak and and uh and unrewarding</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.719" end="01:17:34.719" style="s2">form of the dionysian</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.159" end="01:17:36.000" style="s2">describe the real dionysian then the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.719" end="01:17:38.320" style="s2">the good dionysian</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.000" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">that&#39;s this aesthetic sort of communitas</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.320" end="01:17:41.920" style="s2">where you get a burning map</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:44.400" style="s2">burning man right yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.920" end="01:17:47.679" style="s2">bernie man it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.400" end="01:17:51.120" style="s2">it is paradigmatically heroic</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.679" end="01:17:54.480" style="s2">as a collective effort so it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.120" end="01:17:56.800" style="s2">um dionysian is crowd</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.480" end="01:17:58.400" style="s2">but this is crowd rather than mob and</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.800" end="01:17:59.600" style="s2">it&#39;s crowded in the sense that it takes</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.400" end="01:18:01.600" style="s2">on the heroic</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:03.280" style="s2">why burning man works is because you</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.600" end="01:18:04.800" style="s2">have to make an effort for yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.280" end="01:18:05.360" style="s2">go there you have to make an effort to</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.800" end="01:18:06.880" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.360" end="01:18:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s called radical self-expression</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.880" end="01:18:10.480" style="s2">radical self-reliance if the principle</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.880" end="01:18:12.000" style="s2">radical cephalic wasn&#39;t there burning</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.480" end="01:18:12.800" style="s2">man would be another lynchburg probably</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.000" end="01:18:14.640" style="s2">and then fail</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.800" end="01:18:16.400" style="s2">but it stays and goes on year after year</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.640" end="01:18:18.000" style="s2">after year has 200 copper cats around</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.400" end="01:18:18.640" style="s2">the world again mimicking works here as</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.000" end="01:18:20.640" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.640" end="01:18:22.000" style="s2">and these are authentically dionysian</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.640" end="01:18:23.600" style="s2">very nice so</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.000" end="01:18:25.040" style="s2">these are the festivals and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:26.800" style="s2">carnivals of religion where you</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.040" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">celebrate yeah incredible</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.800" end="01:18:30.239" style="s2">carnival carnival carnival is authentic</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:33.600" style="s2">dynasty exactly</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.239" end="01:18:35.280" style="s2">gotcha carnival yeah but but the exodus</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.600" end="01:18:38.800" style="s2">would be apollonian wouldn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.280" end="01:18:42.320" style="s2">it it requires organization commitment</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.800" end="01:18:44.239" style="s2">faith it requires priest it requires</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.320" end="01:18:46.080" style="s2">chieftain requires a hell of an effort</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.239" end="01:18:47.600" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly like smaller lead to</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.080" end="01:18:49.760" style="s2">actually perform the exodus you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:51.760" style="s2">live in the dionysian this this is an</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.760" end="01:18:53.440" style="s2">event a diagnosis should always be like</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.760" end="01:18:55.360" style="s2">limited in time otherwise it kills you</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.440" end="01:18:57.360" style="s2">basically i think that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.360" end="01:18:59.199" style="s2">festival days like you know burned up</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.360" end="01:19:00.800" style="s2">because he lived constantly in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.199" end="01:19:02.239" style="s2">dionysian in the end he actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.800" end="01:19:02.960" style="s2">realized that he did it because he</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.239" end="01:19:06.000" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.960" end="01:19:07.520" style="s2">he started uh writing uh the crucified</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.000" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">right he identified actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.520" end="01:19:11.360" style="s2">in the end with jesus which is he said i</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.840" end="01:19:13.760" style="s2">am the crucifier didn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.360" end="01:19:15.199" style="s2">just killed me uh so that that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.760" end="01:19:15.840" style="s2">interesting turn he took at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.199" end="01:19:17.840" style="s2">his life</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.840" end="01:19:18.880" style="s2">gerard also writes about that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.840" end="01:19:20.800" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.880" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">these two guys you know gerard and</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.800" end="01:19:23.360" style="s2">nietzsche we should have had them in the</p>

<p begin="01:20:48.400" end="01:20:53.040" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.719" end="01:20:54.000" style="s2">resurrected philosophers is next that&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.040" end="01:20:55.679" style="s2">be a great idea</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.000" end="01:20:57.199" style="s2">there&#39;s the monty python skit with all</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.679" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">the philosophers playing football have</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.199" end="01:21:01.520" style="s2">you seen that one</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:04.480" style="s2">yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah classic yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.520" end="01:21:06.159" style="s2">but i i well you can study hegel or</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.480" end="01:21:08.000" style="s2">white to the rest of your life and they</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.159" end="01:21:09.679" style="s2">they&#39;re richly rewarding when you do it</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.000" end="01:21:12.320" style="s2">and i love both guys to bits but</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.679" end="01:21:13.679" style="s2">i i would insist that just philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.320" end="01:21:15.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.679" end="01:21:17.760" style="s2">the relationalism of why ted looks more</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.920" end="01:21:19.199" style="s2">and more like the pine dialecticism of</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.760" end="01:21:21.440" style="s2">hegel to me the more i read them</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.199" end="01:21:22.400" style="s2">oh yeah but it&#39;s true bradley right so</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.440" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">whitehead was</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.400" end="01:21:25.840" style="s2">in he claimed he never read hegel but he</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:28.320" style="s2">read bradley</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.840" end="01:21:29.280" style="s2">and bradley was the british interpreter</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.320" end="01:21:31.040" style="s2">of hegel</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.280" end="01:21:33.280" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s that&#39;s the connection</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.040" end="01:21:35.679" style="s2">between between whitehead and hegel</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.280" end="01:21:37.159" style="s2">and again that is a very uncorrupted</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.679" end="01:21:39.280" style="s2">version because the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.159" end="01:21:40.800" style="s2">hegelianism in europe was that it was</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.280" end="01:21:41.280" style="s2">either through koja for hippolyta in</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.800" end="01:21:43.280" style="s2">france</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.280" end="01:21:44.880" style="s2">the french took overhead in the 1940s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.280" end="01:21:46.639" style="s2">obviously germany wasn&#39;t ruins</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.880" end="01:21:48.159" style="s2">so we only got these different hippolyte</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.639" end="01:21:51.440" style="s2">and kajiev readings</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.159" end="01:21:51.760" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until la khan and we finally</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.440" end="01:21:53.520" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.760" end="01:21:55.120" style="s2">a proper hegelian reading that he opened</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.520" end="01:21:57.679" style="s2">up to and that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.120" end="01:21:58.320" style="s2">hegelians like uh me and and johnston</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.679" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.320" end="01:22:00.960" style="s2">zlavoishi sheikh and alicos and</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:03.199" style="s2">countries are all coming out of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.960" end="01:22:05.199" style="s2">makoni school and we&#39;re hegelians</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:06.960" style="s2">that that makes perfect sense this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.199" end="01:22:08.960" style="s2">this is a hegelian reading that&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.960" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">closer to nietzsche and whitehead</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.960" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">as it should have been all along but you</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">know hegel had</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:17.120" style="s2">actually had a theory of desire that was</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.639" end="01:22:20.400" style="s2">very close to gerard&#39;s but his was</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.120" end="01:22:22.480" style="s2">this was a diet instead of a triad so</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.400" end="01:22:24.080" style="s2">you want to be desired by somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.480" end="01:22:27.199" style="s2">well while the desire of</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.080" end="01:22:28.880" style="s2">girard is a is a triad right</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.199" end="01:22:30.639" style="s2">there&#39;s always a third third wheel in</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.880" end="01:22:32.480" style="s2">there yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.639" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">but would hagel need a third wheel since</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.480" end="01:22:37.280" style="s2">he was dialectical anyway in anything</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.800" end="01:22:38.239" style="s2">i think so yeah i think that this this</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.280" end="01:22:40.560" style="s2">is a uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.239" end="01:22:42.480" style="s2">he saw he had a very important insight</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.560" end="01:22:46.239" style="s2">hegel but gerard kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.480" end="01:22:49.360" style="s2">um he he uh he perfected it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.239" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">great i&#39;ll look into that oh one more</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.360" end="01:22:53.920" style="s2">thing before we finish tonight</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:56.080" style="s2">the martyrdom thing so is martyrdom</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.920" end="01:22:58.560" style="s2">universal or is it exclusive for only</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.080" end="01:23:00.960" style="s2">some religions where it pays off</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.560" end="01:23:02.480" style="s2">and who&#39;s the martyr really because the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.960" end="01:23:04.400" style="s2">marcher can be both</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.480" end="01:23:06.159" style="s2">really nasty and incredibly well</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.400" end="01:23:07.679" style="s2">incredibly wonderful and respected human</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.159" end="01:23:08.159" style="s2">beings i think the romans didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.679" end="01:23:10.159" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.159" end="01:23:11.520" style="s2">i think this is a christian thing and an</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.159" end="01:23:14.080" style="s2">abrahamic thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.520" end="01:23:15.760" style="s2">abrahamic thing i think it feels like an</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.080" end="01:23:17.040" style="s2">abrahamic thing to me yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.760" end="01:23:19.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like you have to go through your</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.040" end="01:23:21.040" style="s2">torture chamber and stay with your god</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.440" end="01:23:22.880" style="s2">even if you&#39;re being tortured otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.040" end="01:23:24.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not a martyr</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.880" end="01:23:25.440" style="s2">then the saurus don&#39;t have martyrdom</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.480" end="01:23:26.159" style="s2">either they don&#39;t have a word for it</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.440" end="01:23:28.320" style="s2">there&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.159" end="01:23:29.920" style="s2">martyrdom in buddhist texts you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.320" end="01:23:31.920" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.920" end="01:23:33.440" style="s2">just it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a unclean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.920" end="01:23:35.600" style="s2">something about it that is</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.440" end="01:23:36.880" style="s2">if somebody if somebody puts a knife</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.600" end="01:23:39.199" style="s2">against my throat</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.880" end="01:23:40.960" style="s2">and threatens to kill me if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.199" end="01:23:42.800" style="s2">declare myself to be non-seration i can</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.960" end="01:23:44.639" style="s2">say that i&#39;m a non-zoroastrian</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.800" end="01:23:46.239" style="s2">and those are asians nobelians would</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.639" end="01:23:48.480" style="s2">accuse me of anything because i need</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.239" end="01:23:48.480" style="s2">threatening</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.560" end="01:23:52.320" style="s2">the worship of death right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.800" end="01:23:54.800" style="s2">no no no no no no</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.320" end="01:23:55.520" style="s2">no no no it&#39;s a worship of a certain</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.800" end="01:23:57.360" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.520" end="01:23:58.560" style="s2">that is incredibly strong and attractive</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.360" end="01:24:00.080" style="s2">though i have to admit that</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.560" end="01:24:02.159" style="s2">you obviously martial don&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.080" end="01:24:04.719" style="s2">christianity it may be popular and</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.159" end="01:24:06.400" style="s2">and he created a whole pantheon of</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.719" end="01:24:08.560" style="s2">saints which is incredibly useful you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.400" end="01:24:09.840" style="s2">got all the lesser gods of catholicism</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.560" end="01:24:11.360" style="s2">for the next two thousand years from</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.840" end="01:24:13.520" style="s2">marshall because martyrs obviously the</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.360" end="01:24:14.480" style="s2">vast majority of saints are martyrs one</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.520" end="01:24:16.719" style="s2">way or the other</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.480" end="01:24:18.159" style="s2">so it was very useful for christianity</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.719" end="01:24:19.920" style="s2">whereas our astronauts have dragged</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.159" end="01:24:21.760" style="s2">along the folk religion for as long as</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.920" end="01:24:22.800" style="s2">it lasted you know with anahita worship</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.760" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.800" end="01:24:27.840" style="s2">um which made so rest isn&#39;t better</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:29.600" style="s2">for inclusion meaning you got a</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.840" end="01:24:31.679" style="s2">pluralistic society</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.600" end="01:24:33.040" style="s2">power sharing and you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.679" end="01:24:34.560" style="s2">different levels like you can have an</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.040" end="01:24:35.920" style="s2">elite religion here and you kind of fall</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.560" end="01:24:37.199" style="s2">collusion here which is just like india</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.920" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">operates it&#39;s just brahmanism and</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.199" end="01:24:40.080" style="s2">hinduism</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:40.960" style="s2">and that became like zurbanism and folks</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.080" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">or rasterism</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:47.360" style="s2">but but the problem with that is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:49.040" style="s2">you do not actively replace the pantheon</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.360" end="01:24:51.199" style="s2">of the lesser gods which christianity</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.040" end="01:24:52.800" style="s2">did and instead put the martyrs on there</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.199" end="01:24:54.000" style="s2">and find them very useful</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.800" end="01:24:55.920" style="s2">church paintings and everything well</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.000" end="01:24:57.440" style="s2">also i think that the writers</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.920" end="01:24:59.120" style="s2">like if you read the lives of the saints</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.440" end="01:25:00.639" style="s2">the martyrs are always they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.120" end="01:25:01.840" style="s2">they have they&#39;re always morally pure</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.639" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">they always have this</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.840" end="01:25:04.400" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s everything</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:04.960" style="s2">about them is perfect there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:06.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.960" end="01:25:08.320" style="s2">idealization no no no no no no no no no</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.960" end="01:25:10.880" style="s2">no no compared to like like the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.320" end="01:25:12.239" style="s2">when i read about it there are no such</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.880" end="01:25:14.320" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.239" end="01:25:15.360" style="s2">they&#39;re always they used to be like uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.320" end="01:25:17.440" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.360" end="01:25:19.440" style="s2">murderers and killers and no no</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.440" end="01:25:20.239" style="s2">christianity is the same we started with</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.440" end="01:25:23.920" style="s2">cars</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.239" end="01:25:27.120" style="s2">wait a second starting with saint paul</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.920" end="01:25:28.639" style="s2">paul persecuted the jews and killed them</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.120" end="01:25:30.480" style="s2">and went after them and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.639" end="01:25:33.520" style="s2">on the road to damascus he became saint</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.480" end="01:25:36.560" style="s2">paul no christianity is foreign</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.520" end="01:25:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s full of people who all</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.560" end="01:25:42.880" style="s2">transcended themselves by staying</p>

<p begin="01:25:48.800" end="01:25:52.000" style="s2">in the process</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.679" end="01:25:54.080" style="s2">christians will be adamant that martyrs</p>

<p begin="01:25:55.520" end="01:25:58.159" style="s2">there was a sinner in christianity</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:25:59.600" style="s2">everybody&#39;s saying that there are no</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.159" end="01:26:01.280" style="s2">people no they&#39;re not role models to</p>

<p begin="01:26:01.280" end="01:26:06.000" style="s2">the romans to look up to because the</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.280" end="01:26:09.040" style="s2">principle stands on the faith itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.000" end="01:26:11.520" style="s2">okay but it does seem to be a um a</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.040" end="01:26:12.639" style="s2">copying of jesus christ right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.520" end="01:26:14.239" style="s2">do it again</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:16.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of ignoring the fact you</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.239" end="01:26:17.920" style="s2">know the gospel is the good news</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.159" end="01:26:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like you know jesus did it</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.920" end="01:26:22.159" style="s2">for you he did it once and for all</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.400" end="01:26:24.239" style="s2">showed the victimized mechanism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.159" end="01:26:25.840" style="s2">done it&#39;s written down he&#39;s done it for</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.239" end="01:26:27.440" style="s2">you so it&#39;s a new kind of nemesis this</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.840" end="01:26:29.600" style="s2">new kind of imitation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.440" end="01:26:31.760" style="s2">taking over like like a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.600" end="01:26:35.040" style="s2">certain i mean it is a certain uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.760" end="01:26:36.719" style="s2">it is a certain wanting to be the savior</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.040" end="01:26:38.239" style="s2">yourself as well right</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.719" end="01:26:39.760" style="s2">there could certainly be those cases</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.239" end="01:26:41.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why i&#39;m saying them some of</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.760" end="01:26:42.080" style="s2">the martyrs were obviously narcissistic</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.280" end="01:26:44.080" style="s2">assholes</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.080" end="01:26:45.600" style="s2">and some of the martyrs were probably</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.080" end="01:26:46.800" style="s2">fantastic people to look up to</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.600" end="01:26:48.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s probably the same with the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.800" end="01:26:51.920" style="s2">saints in that case and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.719" end="01:26:53.120" style="s2">islam also again we can use the corpses</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.920" end="01:26:55.360" style="s2">for whatever we would like and</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.120" end="01:26:57.520" style="s2">christianity has done so very creatively</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.360" end="01:26:59.840" style="s2">over the past 2000 years</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.520" end="01:27:01.360" style="s2">probably mother teresa wasn&#39;t a very</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.840" end="01:27:03.360" style="s2">nice person at all</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.360" end="01:27:05.040" style="s2">but you know at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.360" end="01:27:05.760" style="s2">corpse could be used for good purposes</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.040" end="01:27:07.520" style="s2">for the church</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.760" end="01:27:08.800" style="s2">and they gladly did so so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.520" end="01:27:11.199" style="s2">certain cynicism</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.800" end="01:27:12.239" style="s2">in the in the usage of corpses after</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.199" end="01:27:13.600" style="s2">they&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.239" end="01:27:14.880" style="s2">because we have the liberty to do</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.600" end="01:27:15.920" style="s2">whatever we like with them they&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.880" end="01:27:17.600" style="s2">after all</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.920" end="01:27:19.440" style="s2">right we do what we want with the</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.600" end="01:27:23.280" style="s2">heritages</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.440" end="01:27:25.920" style="s2">so we do so which which is fine i</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.280" end="01:27:27.280" style="s2">i think pr i think thomas&#39;s christie of</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.920" end="01:27:29.520" style="s2">martyrs</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.280" end="01:27:31.199" style="s2">being narcissistic copycats of christ on</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.520" end="01:27:32.080" style="s2">the cross in those cases where it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.199" end="01:27:35.120" style="s2">is a classic</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.080" end="01:27:37.280" style="s2">protestant critique of catholicism</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.120" end="01:27:38.480" style="s2">and it makes sense it makes sense it</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.280" end="01:27:40.800" style="s2">just made catholicism</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.480" end="01:27:41.520" style="s2">so much richer religion islam they seem</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.800" end="01:27:43.679" style="s2">to love</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.520" end="01:27:44.560" style="s2">they love martyrs and islam as well too</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.679" end="01:27:46.000" style="s2">don&#39;t they isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.560" end="01:27:47.760" style="s2">something that you you would you would</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.000" end="01:27:49.840" style="s2">want to be a martyr like you would you</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.760" end="01:27:51.280" style="s2">would just train to be a martyr and</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.840" end="01:27:53.360" style="s2">that would be your you would have that</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.280" end="01:27:54.800" style="s2">as a goal right yeah but they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.360" end="01:27:56.560" style="s2">the same tooth that you have in</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.800" end="01:27:57.760" style="s2">christ in catholicism because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.560" end="01:27:59.440" style="s2">more or less guaranteed if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.760" end="01:28:03.120" style="s2">martyr and somebody saw you die</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.440" end="01:28:04.080" style="s2">right i i i i go to paradise you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.120" end="01:28:05.600" style="s2">looking for the author</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.080" end="01:28:07.280" style="s2">but i&#39;d be careful to have that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.600" end="01:28:08.159" style="s2">exactly a martyrdom i might even leave</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.280" end="01:28:10.320" style="s2">it out of the book</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.159" end="01:28:11.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very very interesting topic</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.320" end="01:28:12.400" style="s2">and it probably fascinates because</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.600" end="01:28:14.159" style="s2">erastism</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.400" end="01:28:16.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t think much of it it certainly is</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.159" end="01:28:17.760" style="s2">a huge part of islam and it says islam</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.159" end="01:28:19.760" style="s2">has mimicked</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.760" end="01:28:21.760" style="s2">his rationalism to a large extent they</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.760" end="01:28:22.400" style="s2">got it from gnosticism or something like</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.760" end="01:28:25.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.400" end="01:28:27.280" style="s2">something gnostic about martial and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.360" end="01:28:28.480" style="s2">but i i&#39;m not an expert in islamic</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.280" end="01:28:30.480" style="s2">martyrdoms at all</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.480" end="01:28:31.760" style="s2">moderates at all um and certainly</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.480" end="01:28:33.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured out the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.760" end="01:28:38.000" style="s2">between the gnostic and the martyr</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.440" end="01:28:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a nasty one um so</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.000" end="01:28:45.040" style="s2">yeah martyrdom um with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.000" end="01:28:46.560" style="s2">uh triangular desire so</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.040" end="01:28:48.800" style="s2">you have to kind of take a look at for</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.560" end="01:28:51.280" style="s2">example things like sado masochism</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.800" end="01:28:53.199" style="s2">um because because it you will probably</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.280" end="01:28:55.199" style="s2">find the explanation there</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.199" end="01:28:56.639" style="s2">so girard has some very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.199" end="01:28:58.400" style="s2">theories and</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.639" end="01:29:00.239" style="s2">that basically explains why do people</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.400" end="01:29:01.360" style="s2">for example adopt say the massachusetts</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.239" end="01:29:03.920" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.360" end="01:29:04.800" style="s2">uh and uh or or for example the</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.920" end="01:29:07.600" style="s2">relationships of</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.800" end="01:29:08.320" style="s2">of uh uh you know a cult follower and a</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.600" end="01:29:10.080" style="s2">guru</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.320" end="01:29:12.000" style="s2">so these are these are basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.080" end="01:29:14.159" style="s2">elementary um</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.000" end="01:29:16.560" style="s2">elementary outcomes of of triangular</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.159" end="01:29:16.560" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.719" end="01:29:20.159" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s getting closer i think that</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.679" end="01:29:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.159" end="01:29:23.440" style="s2">yeah i think and there&#39;s a nasty side to</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.400" end="01:29:25.440" style="s2">that whole thing with sort of</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.440" end="01:29:27.920" style="s2">masochistic narcissism</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.440" end="01:29:29.679" style="s2">leading up to martyrdom certainly but uh</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.920" end="01:29:31.760" style="s2">i&#39;m sure the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.679" end="01:29:33.199" style="s2">just scapegoated and happened to be nice</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.760" end="01:29:36.320" style="s2">people and and</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.199" end="01:29:37.920" style="s2">who refused to you know at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.320" end="01:29:39.040" style="s2">the day if you&#39;re being tortured and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.920" end="01:29:39.679" style="s2">go through suffering you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.040" end="01:29:41.600" style="s2">gonna die</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.679" end="01:29:43.199" style="s2">and they tell you to resign from your</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.600" end="01:29:45.040" style="s2">faith and the guys stand in front of you</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.199" end="01:29:46.159" style="s2">are just ugly idiots it&#39;s just like why</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.040" end="01:29:47.520" style="s2">would you give it to them they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.159" end="01:29:48.159" style="s2">kill you anyway you might as well stay</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.520" end="01:29:50.320" style="s2">with the faith</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.159" end="01:29:52.719" style="s2">that&#39;s probably how most martial dumbs</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.320" end="01:29:56.159" style="s2">actually occurred you know so</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.719" end="01:29:58.000" style="s2">um but is it interesting the stories are</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.159" end="01:30:01.040" style="s2">always told in a heroic way right</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.000" end="01:30:03.120" style="s2">yeah exactly meteorology is it&#39;s a topic</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.040" end="01:30:03.840" style="s2">open to our students to explore if they</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.120" end="01:30:06.239" style="s2">like to</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.840" end="01:30:07.760" style="s2">i think i i think i i think i&#39;m fine</p>
