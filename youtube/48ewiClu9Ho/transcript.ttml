<p begin="00:00:00.210" end="00:00:00.969" style="s2">It&#39;s not all that</p>
<p begin="00:00:00.969" end="00:00:03.479" style="s2">happens though when they eat the fruit of the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.549" end="00:00:07.949" style="s2">The knowledge of good and evil because it&#39;s not called the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of nakedness</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.349" end="00:00:11.069" style="s2">It&#39;s called the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.070" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">And I thought about that for a tremendous amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">It&#39;s like what in the world because I assumed these old stories make sense. You know, it&#39;s a game</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:25.319" style="s2">I play it&#39;s like they&#39;re old. They&#39;ve been around a long time. I&#39;m not sure why they&#39;re there, but there they are</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.869" end="00:00:28.739" style="s2">they&#39;re at the basis of our culture like</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.990" end="00:00:34.619" style="s2">many many of the stories that we depend on depend on them our whole culture grew out of their</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.260" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">Roots, let&#39;s say and so I assume that our ancestors who managed to survive conditions</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:43.290" style="s2">That would have done a lot of us in very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.290" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">I can tell you we&#39;re a lot smarter than we think and that the mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.100" end="00:00:53.460" style="s2">Processes that that produce these stories and compelled us to remember them are a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.949" end="00:00:56.669" style="s2">Psychologically significant than we generally tend to presume</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">So I give them the benefit of the doubt and try to understand why it is that they might make sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.379" end="00:01:05.849" style="s2">Instead of assuming that they don&#39;t and that that&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.580" end="00:01:10.349" style="s2">As their complicated stories and so I thought about this nakedness</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.049" end="00:01:16.379" style="s2">Knowledge of good and evil idea for a very very long time like about 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.900" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">Puzzling it out. What the hell is the relationship between discovering that you&#39;re naked and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.270" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">discovering good and evil and then one day</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.750" end="00:01:28.139" style="s2">mostly because of studying totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.140" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">Totalitarianism and the atrocity that proclivity for people to commit atrocity in the service of their group belief</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.100" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">Or maybe just because that&#39;s what they were like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.759" end="00:01:46.499" style="s2">Clued me in and I thought I see this is one of the things that really makes people different than animals</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.500" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">It&#39;s like, you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:53.969" style="s2">It&#39;s one thing to realize that you&#39;re naked to realize that you&#39;re naked means that you know that you&#39;re limited in time and space</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.579" end="00:01:58.979" style="s2">That you&#39;re mortal and that you&#39;re subject to degeneration and to social</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.649" end="00:02:05.339" style="s2">Humiliation and to your own harsh judgement all of that nakedness to know that you&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.979" end="00:02:10.378" style="s2">Against the world and definitely a source of shame because of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.929" end="00:02:11.980" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.980" end="00:02:16.179" style="s2">and a felt lack of self-sufficiency and then no wonder and no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.760" end="00:02:19.450" style="s2">it&#39;s understandable, but the other thing is is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.970" end="00:02:21.970" style="s2">This is and this is the rub</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.040" end="00:02:29.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you&#39;re out in the veldt and you&#39;re not being very careful and a hungry lion jumps on you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:36.069" style="s2">Eats you you don&#39;t really think of the lion as evil. I mean you might right at that moment, but you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.069" end="00:02:41.409" style="s2">Philosophically, it&#39;s not evil. It&#39;s just hungry and as soon as it&#39;s not hungry then</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.110" end="00:02:48.789" style="s2">It goes and has asleep and it&#39;s not up to some malevolent trick. It&#39;s it&#39;s done for the day but</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:57.160" style="s2">Human being that&#39;s a whole different sort of creature. And because human being is capable of doing terrible things to someone else and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.099" end="00:03:04.719" style="s2">Consciously, so you think well, what&#39;s the connection between that and nakedness itself? And it seems to be this is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:12.849" style="s2">Here&#39;s the thing is that once I realize that I can be hurt, you know, I have a self conscious model of my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.430" end="00:03:14.900" style="s2">vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.900" end="00:03:18.819" style="s2">Then I can generalize that to other people I can think. Oh, this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.549" end="00:03:23.828" style="s2">Here&#39;s how I can be heard by myself. Here&#39;s how I can be heard by society</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.900" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">Here&#39;s how I can be hurt by nature and by the unknown and what that implies is that well you can be hurt</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.100" end="00:03:33.579" style="s2">with exactly the same mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.700" end="00:03:37.479" style="s2">that in need immediately becomes part of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.870" end="00:03:46.840" style="s2">what would you say my repertoire of ability and then all of a sudden the world is no longer a walled a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:55.238" style="s2">Walled garden and a well watered place, but it&#39;s a moral story because with that ability to inflict</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.849" end="00:03:56.870" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.870" end="00:04:01.630" style="s2">Comes the knowledge of good and evil as far as I&#39;m concerned those are identical</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.599" end="00:04:09.488" style="s2">Propositions because now we have the choice a deep choice about how we&#39;re going to treat ourselves and each other we can inflict</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.310" end="00:04:13.239" style="s2">tremendous pain and suffering on each other in a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.510" end="00:04:16.510" style="s2">voluntary and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:18.650" style="s2">conscious manner in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.650" end="00:04:26.030" style="s2">a way that no other animal can manage and that&#39;s the dawning of the moral sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">capacity we now have to choose to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:36.919" style="s2">Mitigate or exaggerate suffering and and that&#39;s not all but it&#39;s a huge part of it</p>
