<p begin="00:00:01.640" end="00:00:07.100" style="s2">well the first thing was you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.460" end="00:00:09.170" style="s2">being honest with yourself I do think</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.100" end="00:00:10.730" style="s2">that one of the great things about</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.170" end="00:00:13.370" style="s2">psychedelics is they kind of force you</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.730" end="00:00:14.960" style="s2">to be honest with yourself right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.370" end="00:00:18.830" style="s2">often being said that they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.960" end="00:00:20.960" style="s2">mirror to who you are right now so there</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.830" end="00:00:23.570" style="s2">is that aspect I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.960" end="00:00:25.250" style="s2">important idea of self confrontation I</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.570" end="00:00:27.439" style="s2">think that&#39;s also one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.250" end="00:00:29.420" style="s2">people can be a bit trepidatious or</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.439" end="00:00:31.460" style="s2">anxious also because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.420" end="00:00:33.400" style="s2">necessarily a clear mirror right the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.460" end="00:00:35.780" style="s2">message you might get back is one not</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.400" end="00:00:39.050" style="s2">you should take with great importance</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.780" end="00:00:40.850" style="s2">but it&#39;s often not going to be a message</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.050" end="00:00:42.350" style="s2">where it&#39;s like oh yeah I got that I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.850" end="00:00:45.230" style="s2">just translate that into my life</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.350" end="00:00:47.560" style="s2">immediately it&#39;s all very very clear and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.230" end="00:00:53.150" style="s2">the experience of course is taking place</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.560" end="00:00:57.190" style="s2">largely imagistic alee and like I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.150" end="00:00:59.150" style="s2">suppose growth and development in life</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.190" end="00:01:01.850" style="s2">being honest with yourself is something</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.150" end="00:01:03.440" style="s2">that takes time and so the feedback you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.850" end="00:01:05.810" style="s2">get is something that you have to work</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.440" end="00:01:09.800" style="s2">with yeah so they&#39;re coming to a point</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.810" end="00:01:11.870" style="s2">of responsibility as well going back to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.800" end="00:01:14.660" style="s2">that journal article the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.870" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">context in psychedelic experience there</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.660" end="00:01:18.590" style="s2">was a call out by the researcher Robyn</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.590" end="00:01:21.860" style="s2">because we are at this point where that</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.860" end="00:01:29.570" style="s2">are at this turning point there is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.170" end="00:01:31.850" style="s2">there is a there is still a risk that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.570" end="00:01:34.730" style="s2">something could go very wrong in a trial</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.850" end="00:01:37.190" style="s2">and these medicines could be delayed or</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.730" end="00:01:40.159" style="s2">there is a risk that people become</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.190" end="00:01:42.110" style="s2">increasingly concerned about deaths at</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.110" end="00:01:48.170" style="s2">ever ever caused by a psychedelic any</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.040" end="00:01:50.630" style="s2">implicated in a combination of many</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.170" end="00:01:54.050" style="s2">drugs but the safety profile</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.630" end="00:01:57.710" style="s2">psychedelics is incomparable to really</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.050" end="00:01:59.990" style="s2">any other substance so safety profiles</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.710" end="00:02:01.729" style="s2">is one core differentiating feature and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.990" end="00:02:02.840" style="s2">there&#39;s good information on this I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.729" end="00:02:05.270" style="s2">point you in the direction of that right</p>

<p begin="00:02:38.690" end="00:02:45.319" style="s2">ballpark is heroin and crack cocaine so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.470" end="00:02:48.140" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s something we can be aware</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.140" end="00:02:56.299" style="s2">body but as you say responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.489" end="00:02:57.590" style="s2">the mind and setting so back to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.299" end="00:02:58.970" style="s2">Journal article there was a call at me</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:12.739" style="s2">psychedelics I&#39;ve often thought about</p>

<p begin="00:03:52.670" end="00:03:56.359" style="s2">have to be very careful with how you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.930" end="00:03:58.100" style="s2">affect others and I really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.359" end="00:04:00.470" style="s2">write you will not do not meant to write</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.100" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">I really wanted I was having some really</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.470" end="00:04:02.690" style="s2">profound thoughts I thought I might lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.510" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.690" end="00:04:06.950" style="s2">and so I thought okay well maybe at</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.510" end="00:04:08.780" style="s2">night time I&#39;ll write in my book on</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.950" end="00:04:12.079" style="s2">covers but actually there&#39;s a scratching</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.780" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">noise of the pen might might be heard by</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.079" end="00:04:16.940" style="s2">the girl in the bed over the curtain and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:18.950" style="s2">maybe that will confuse her maybe or</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:21.460" style="s2">maybe I want to write on the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.950" end="00:04:25.909" style="s2">breaking the rules was that mean for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.460" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">so I ended up writing in the shower a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.909" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">partner</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:31.469" style="s2">I tell this story because it made me</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.469" end="00:04:36.870" style="s2">breaker and that is if you break rules</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:39.889" style="s2">you better break them like they didn&#39;t</p>
