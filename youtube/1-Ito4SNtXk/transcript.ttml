<p begin="00:24:00.890" end="00:24:07.270" style="s2">strongly as one of the things to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.590" end="00:24:07.270" style="s2">consider for your ecology practices</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.590" end="00:24:15.590" style="s2">Karima</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.890" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">hello crema in Plato&#39;s Republic he</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.590" end="00:24:20.270" style="s2">categorized harmonics as the last of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.960" end="00:24:22.100" style="s2">five mathematical disciplines which</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.270" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">philosopher Kings need to study was he a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.100" end="00:24:32.710" style="s2">chanter or singer probably some of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">stuff&#39;s is very hard to reconstruct but</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.710" end="00:24:41.060" style="s2">we know that he was a poet he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:44.090" style="s2">intending to be a poet and poetry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.060" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s thought that poetry was largely</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.090" end="00:24:51.550" style="s2">chanted or sung not merely spoken and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:57.170" style="s2">there was and therefore there was also</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.550" end="00:25:00.940" style="s2">deep overlap with music we also know</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.170" end="00:25:04.340" style="s2">that Plato&#39;s deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.940" end="00:25:06.770" style="s2">Pythagoras and the Pythagorean community</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.340" end="00:25:09.950" style="s2">deeply influenced and so the connections</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.770" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">between music and math and speech are</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.950" end="00:25:17.720" style="s2">also very salient to him so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:21.830" style="s2">plausible that he was doing something</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.720" end="00:25:25.160" style="s2">like chanting that&#39;s the best answer I</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.830" end="00:25:28.340" style="s2">can give kara like a soy prema to a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.160" end="00:25:30.560" style="s2">very good very good historical question</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.340" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">one of the things we can try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.560" end="00:25:36.950" style="s2">out when we do the wisdom of Hypatia and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:41.210" style="s2">the Neal and the Neoplatonic aspect this</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.950" end="00:25:43.400" style="s2">is called the urge if these ritual</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.210" end="00:25:45.380" style="s2">enactments that are designed to in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.400" end="00:25:47.690" style="s2">sense empower us but they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.380" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">careful about all of this as we get into</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.690" end="00:25:56.360" style="s2">it but chanting was plausibly something</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:58.460" style="s2">that was happening in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.360" end="00:26:01.940" style="s2">community or in the end the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.460" end="00:26:05.019" style="s2">community mark</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.940" end="00:26:08.389" style="s2">hi Park great to see you as always</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.389" end="00:26:12.049" style="s2">practice is rather powerful and seems to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.639" end="00:26:14.419" style="s2">be sinking my left and right side</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.049" end="00:26:17.090" style="s2">somehow an important way I&#39;m at a loss</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.419" end="00:26:19.490" style="s2">to explain it um I think that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.090" end="00:26:22.730" style="s2">with the fact that chanting is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.490" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">about very powerful integration internet</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.730" end="00:26:26.179" style="s2">interhemispheric integration between</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">left and right you might actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.179" end="00:26:31.399" style="s2">experience that in an embodied fashion</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:34.879" style="s2">and then the neural actual neural narrow</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.399" end="00:26:36.379" style="s2">axial integration the up-down and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.879" end="00:26:41.799" style="s2">integration and the brain body</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.379" end="00:26:45.100" style="s2">integration might also be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.799" end="00:26:48.019" style="s2">magnifying that because it really</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.100" end="00:26:53.179" style="s2">magnifies sort of the felt energetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.019" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">aspects of the body so it&#39;s makes good</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.179" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2">sense to me that that would be happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:59.480" style="s2">to you so thank you for sharing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:01.730" style="s2">glad you&#39;re finding the chanting</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.730" end="00:27:07.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t teach it right away and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.529" end="00:27:08.870" style="s2">overwhelm people and also it is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.490" end="00:27:10.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the connection like I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.870" end="00:27:16.070" style="s2">it in chanting and enchanting the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.610" end="00:27:18.049" style="s2">temptation to want magical powers it is</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.149" end="00:27:44.690" style="s2">heat in my stomach area on the in-breath</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:46.220" style="s2">and emptiness on the other mi tryin I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.690" end="00:27:49.220" style="s2">tryin to remember that feeling Jim I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.220" end="00:27:50.740" style="s2">said any thoughts remember it a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.220" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">times and then let it go</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.740" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">and then give it a chance to come up</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:59.990" style="s2">spontaneously brought him up rather than</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:05.659" style="s2">you seeking it out I was reading from my</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.990" end="00:28:07.179" style="s2">lectio a Sufi quote really hit home he</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.659" end="00:28:10.850" style="s2">said everything that I&#39;m speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.179" end="00:28:14.750" style="s2">cannot be found by seeking but only</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.850" end="00:28:15.500" style="s2">seekers find it so you have to try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.750" end="00:28:18.530" style="s2">get this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:21.650" style="s2">you seek and then he let the seeking go</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.530" end="00:28:24.080" style="s2">and if it&#39;s resonate it will come back</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.650" end="00:28:28.070" style="s2">and it will come back with the reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.080" end="00:28:33.680" style="s2">you cannot give it so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.070" end="00:28:38.060" style="s2">would recommend going forward so um</p>
