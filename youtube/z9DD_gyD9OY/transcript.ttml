<p begin="00:00:25.470" end="00:00:28.650" style="s2">I think that there&#39;s some nuance that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">needs to be injected into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.650" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">conversation what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:35.010" style="s2">between a cult and a religion I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">that the cult is a negative thing I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">think religion isn&#39;t a negative thing I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">don&#39;t think that religion itself is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:42.780" style="s2">negative and if you look at people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">get into cults and have to go through</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.180" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">certain things that you need to do to</p>

<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">characteristics and that make you feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.600" style="s2">good but even though you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">praised for individual characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.600" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">that&#39;s not the same thing your identity</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.560" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">your individual this is such a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.450" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">thing to pull apart as well because</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to hold it the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">of two perspectives like there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">for example and so a lot of the reaction</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">against the social justice groupthink is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:33.450" style="s2">easily characterized by people as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">this is just coming from the right but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">think the complexity that has to be held</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2">is these are good values inclusivity is</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:46.500" style="s2">a good value treating people with</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:49.500" style="s2">respect is a good value yes but if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.500" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">make these your primary axioms then they</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.500" end="00:01:54.210" style="s2">tend to lead to madness if you make</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">inclusivity and diversity your primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.210" end="00:01:58.670" style="s2">axioms rather than the dignity of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">individual for example rather than</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.670" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">self-realization rather than free speech</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">then you&#39;re in danger of like if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">make care rather than truth your</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">then you&#39;re in very dangerous waters</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:14.370" style="s2">very very quickly because by definition</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:16.440" style="s2">you are going to then have to stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.370" end="00:02:19.770" style="s2">certain people speaking if you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:21.450" style="s2">that what they&#39;re saying is not is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.770" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">danger of offending others for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.450" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">it&#39;s about and that&#39;s where it maps on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">to the religious mindset really really</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">clearly it&#39;s like your religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:30.390" style="s2">perspective is what are you making your</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:31.590" style="s2">primary Aksum is what are you making</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.390" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">your primary values</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.590" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s a very delicate</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:38.880" style="s2">conversation to be had because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:40.830" style="s2">easy to say this whole social justice</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.880" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">world is a cult and we&#39;ve got a we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.830" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">got to fight back against it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.500" style="s2">really it&#39;s it&#39;s in danger becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.630" style="s2">new religion but to be able to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.500" end="00:02:50.940" style="s2">complexity of saying we&#39;re not saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.630" end="00:02:53.459" style="s2">your values are wrong we&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.940" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">taken to an extreme they become wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.459" end="00:02:57.660" style="s2">yeah is it like it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:02:59.910" style="s2">threading and I have a needle to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.660" end="00:03:03.180" style="s2">that to make that conversation or make</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.910" end="00:03:05.100" style="s2">those points in a way that doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.180" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">allows people to hear them if they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:13.320" style="s2">sort of very black and white narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.500" end="00:03:15.000" style="s2">of goodies versus baddies and yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.320" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">see what I mean it&#39;s almost like you</p>
