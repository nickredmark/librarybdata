<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">Association Casas and that is turned</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">into fruition so what I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">today about are the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:29.869" style="s2">transformation and aspiration in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">psychology of growth I&#39;m going to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.869" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">opportune for me to set up a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">problems that confront us when we want</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">to talk about growth and unchanging non</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">trivial fashion so this what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">to do not all of this overview will make</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">sense but I&#39;ll give you a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">what&#39;s coming I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">the problem with transformation the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">central problem I&#39;m going to ask is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">it a rational process is it ultimately a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">cognitive process then we move on to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">aspiration and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:57.500" style="s2">concluding that development is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">irrational process</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.500" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">the third thing will be to move on to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">discussion of a non inferential form of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:08.520" style="s2">rationality that is relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">transformation that aspiration but that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.520" end="00:02:12.360" style="s2">will then take us into another problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">the problem of the paradox of self</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.360" end="00:02:18.090" style="s2">creation I will then move on to build</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:19.470" style="s2">the case for how we could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:22.470" style="s2">overcome the problem these are all</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.470" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">conceptual problems of course with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.470" end="00:02:27.209" style="s2">problem of self creation will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">dynamical self-organization will talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.209" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">about self dissection of the interval</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:32.819" style="s2">development then I want to get you so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:34.379" style="s2">Marc Lewis&#39;s work on reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">narrowing and talk about its converse</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.379" end="00:02:39.870" style="s2">reciprocal opening and then move on to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:41.610" style="s2">discussing enacted analogy as a solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.870" end="00:02:44.129" style="s2">to the kind of ignorance by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.610" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">regulators we find problematic within</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.129" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">transformation so most of that was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">what I extracted they so let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:53.819" style="s2">with something while the government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:56.129" style="s2">concrete but it&#39;s it&#39;s at least usually</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.819" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">more interesting so this goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.129" end="00:03:00.050" style="s2">seminal work how they all who literally</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:02.270" style="s2">wrote the book on transform</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.050" end="00:03:05.930" style="s2">experience entitled transformative</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.270" end="00:03:07.880" style="s2">experience and I think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.930" end="00:03:10.280" style="s2">important book and I thought had the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.880" end="00:03:12.820" style="s2">pleasure to meet and work with Lori so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.280" end="00:03:16.190" style="s2">let&#39;s start with a thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.820" end="00:03:19.190" style="s2">experiment establish beautiful result</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.190" end="00:03:21.740" style="s2">from this experiment the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.190" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">thought experiment is to highlight what</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.740" end="00:03:26.120" style="s2">is normally backgrounded and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:29.990" style="s2">some of our unquestioned intuitions in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.120" end="00:03:31.700" style="s2">deployment so here&#39;s the thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.990" end="00:03:34.820" style="s2">experiment that she uses it involved</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.700" end="00:03:38.600" style="s2">your friends come to you and they offer</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.820" end="00:03:41.300" style="s2">you offer you just into little evidence</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.600" end="00:03:44.540" style="s2">that they can get the follow they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.300" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">turn you into a vampire and then she</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.540" end="00:03:52.250" style="s2">asked you should you do it should you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:54.710" style="s2">it now what&#39;s the problem what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.250" end="00:04:12.860" style="s2">problem with this well the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.710" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">this and we&#39;re gonna build this so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.860" end="00:04:17.180" style="s2">unpack that this is not going when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:18.650" style="s2">white this has to do with respect tattle</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.180" end="00:04:20.120" style="s2">knowing this is knowing what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.650" end="00:04:22.070" style="s2">there&#39;s knowing what it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.120" end="00:04:24.020" style="s2">drunk knowing what it&#39;s like to be sober</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.070" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">it&#39;s bound out with a state of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.020" end="00:04:28.440" style="s2">consciousness rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.880" style="s2">a set of beliefs so what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.440" end="00:04:31.650" style="s2">your perspective annoying well I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.880" end="00:04:33.479" style="s2">it right now I&#39;m salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.650" end="00:04:36.509" style="s2">things are said it&#39;s then they felt to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.479" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">me as salient and this is dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.509" end="00:04:40.229" style="s2">shifting when I turn my attention to her</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:42.330" style="s2">she stands out she things but now she</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.229" end="00:04:44.550" style="s2">stands out of she fades so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.330" end="00:04:47.430" style="s2">dynamic salience landscaping that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">going on I constantly sighs what makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.430" end="00:04:51.660" style="s2">me call sizing up I&#39;m picking up</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:54.539" style="s2">particular features I&#39;m for grounding</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.660" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">some background in some others and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.539" end="00:04:58.500" style="s2">the ones that for grounding I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:04:59.880" style="s2">configuring them together and the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.500" end="00:05:02.759" style="s2">I&#39;ve configured them together it brings</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.880" end="00:05:06.120" style="s2">in what Marlo Conte called optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.759" end="00:05:08.009" style="s2">so I&#39;m sort of moving around objects to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.120" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">try and get the best balance between the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.009" end="00:05:13.410" style="s2">detail and the overall I can&#39;t never get</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">all of the information too close too</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.410" end="00:05:18.150" style="s2">much detail too far away to get the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">gestalt I lose too much and I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.150" end="00:05:22.620" style="s2">shifting around and that shifts</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:25.410" style="s2">according to you know what problems I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.620" end="00:05:27.150" style="s2">fix that means I&#39;m also a sexualizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.410" end="00:05:29.690" style="s2">things when I&#39;m seeing everything I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">happening right now right that&#39;s aliens</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">landscaping that sizing up that optimal</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:42.599" style="s2">thing that specialization now what does</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:45.510" style="s2">that give me that gives me a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.599" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">here now what you&#39;d like to be here now</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.510" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">and things are centered on me in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:51.900" style="s2">here now that&#39;s what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.380" end="00:05:53.729" style="s2">perspective we use an aesthetic metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.900" end="00:05:55.620" style="s2">like perspective and painting to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.729" end="00:05:58.229" style="s2">talked about the here nowness the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.620" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">things are salience landscape sized up a</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:07.860" style="s2">and have the way everything is fitted</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:10.050" style="s2">together we write we commitment we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.860" end="00:06:11.639" style="s2">how to manipulate this reliably for</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.050" end="00:06:13.080" style="s2">example within psychology we can do</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.639" end="00:06:16.169" style="s2">what&#39;s called construe level</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.080" end="00:06:17.639" style="s2">manipulation so this is a robust finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.169" end="00:06:19.919" style="s2">in psychology that when</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.629" end="00:06:25.710" style="s2">this goes back to an age of practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.969" end="00:06:28.110" style="s2">from the Stoics called the view from</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.710" end="00:06:30.360" style="s2">above I can ask you to sort of imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.110" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">yourself in this room and then imagine</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.830" end="00:09:35.690" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t afford me flying in because</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.470" end="00:09:50.029" style="s2">this would get back to vampires</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:57.830" style="s2">he means their biological heritage and</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.089" end="00:10:05.240" style="s2">gives them a particular pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.920" end="00:10:07.250" style="s2">affordances that I don&#39;t have so they</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.240" end="00:10:09.640" style="s2">have agent arena relationships that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.250" end="00:10:11.650" style="s2">don&#39;t have because I can&#39;t get in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.640" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">relationships and find those affordances</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.650" end="00:10:17.260" style="s2">they don&#39;t affect my perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:20.350" style="s2">knowing because that those affordances</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.260" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">actually constrain my perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.350" end="00:10:26.950" style="s2">them and so the Lions have a different</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">age in a relationship and that means</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.950" end="00:10:30.730" style="s2">what they find salient and relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:31.870" style="s2">important is very different so even if</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.730" end="00:10:35.380" style="s2">they could speak it wouldn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.870" end="00:10:40.260" style="s2">sense to me but what is the case for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.380" end="00:10:40.260" style="s2">Lions is of course the case for vampires</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.340" end="00:10:51.000" style="s2">respectable knowing makes us</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.910" end="00:10:54.790" style="s2">situationally aware of which affordances</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.000" end="00:10:56.650" style="s2">can be appropriated by our skills to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.790" end="00:10:59.350" style="s2">solve our problems so we have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.650" end="00:11:01.390" style="s2">biocultural niche making that makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.350" end="00:11:03.730" style="s2">affordances and then I respect how</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.390" end="00:11:06.280" style="s2">annoying select of those ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.730" end="00:11:10.150" style="s2">appropriate right now for solving my</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.280" end="00:11:11.860" style="s2">problems that&#39;s respectable and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.150" end="00:11:16.150" style="s2">participatory knowing and it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.860" end="00:11:18.610" style="s2">what you laugh with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.150" end="00:11:20.260" style="s2">vampire so let me give you a comparison</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.610" end="00:11:22.420" style="s2">to some more standard kinds of known</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.260" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">just to draw out of what Le Paul is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.420" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">trying to get us to for it round which</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.930" style="s2">we want a background is what we normally</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:30.370" style="s2">foreground especially in psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.930" end="00:11:34.060" style="s2">propositional more than procedural</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.370" end="00:11:35.710" style="s2">matter so propositional knowing this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.060" end="00:11:36.970" style="s2">you know propositions are statements</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.710" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">that can be true or false these are of</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:45.910" style="s2">knowing we manipulate compositions by</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.910" end="00:11:49.900" style="s2">collated into theories and you are</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:57.640" style="s2">by that argument adopt that belief</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.290" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">that&#39;s different from procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.640" end="00:12:01.540" style="s2">that&#39;s knowing how when how to catch a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.150" style="s2">ball you know how to ride a bike</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.540" end="00:12:07.090" style="s2">this is manipulated by sensory motor</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.830" end="00:12:26.110" style="s2">indicated it gives you your situational</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.980" end="00:12:49.830" style="s2">ok so now that we got try to the guts of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:51.720" style="s2">what Paul&#39;s 22</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.389" end="00:14:58.130" style="s2">problematic about all of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.009" end="00:15:01.620" style="s2">that perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.130" end="00:15:04.620" style="s2">ignorance means according to Paul that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.620" end="00:15:06.690" style="s2">we cannot apply standard decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.620" end="00:15:09.149" style="s2">procedures how are we supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.690" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">probably told like sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.149" end="00:15:13.709" style="s2">academic literature how do we make a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:15.779" style="s2">rational decision what we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.709" end="00:15:18.569" style="s2">assign a probability to the outcome and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.779" end="00:15:20.430" style="s2">then we assign a value to the income and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.569" end="00:15:22.470" style="s2">then we calculate you know usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.430" end="00:15:24.690" style="s2">some you know multiplication function</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.470" end="00:15:26.339" style="s2">probability x value and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.690" end="00:15:28.199" style="s2">compare all the other pumps and the one</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.339" end="00:15:30.839" style="s2">with the highest product that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.199" end="00:15:32.579" style="s2">I should choose and it&#39;s all calculated</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.839" end="00:15:35.160" style="s2">it&#39;s all computational it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.579" end="00:15:37.139" style="s2">inferential it&#39;s beautiful and it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.160" end="00:15:41.449" style="s2">work in the situations I just pointed</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.139" end="00:15:44.610" style="s2">out to you why because you&#39;re ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.449" end="00:15:46.889" style="s2">you don&#39;t know the incomes you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.610" end="00:15:50.940" style="s2">know the outcomes until you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.889" end="00:15:52.829" style="s2">gone through the transformation you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.940" end="00:15:55.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know the values cuz your values</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.829" end="00:15:57.810" style="s2">are not going to be constant from here</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.260" end="00:15:58.920" style="s2">and there you&#39;re going to be a different</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.810" end="00:16:02.120" style="s2">person with a different set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.920" end="00:16:05.250" style="s2">preferences and different set of values</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.120" end="00:16:07.790" style="s2">and notice that the ignorance goes both</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.250" end="00:16:10.260" style="s2">ways we&#39;ve said well I shouldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.790" end="00:16:12.569" style="s2">but then you don&#39;t know what you missing</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.260" end="00:16:13.529" style="s2">well that I should do it but then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.569" end="00:16:16.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to be</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.279" end="00:16:28.279" style="s2">so it looks like this is what Lori seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.149" end="00:16:30.970" style="s2">to conclude there&#39;s no influential way</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.279" end="00:16:33.769" style="s2">through such transformative decisions I</p>

<p begin="00:16:45.439" end="00:16:49.089" style="s2">first of all let&#39;s make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.759" end="00:16:52.220" style="s2">because Fodor is criticizing Piaget</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.220" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">conference and so we need to invoke when</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:03.470" style="s2">a piace is no distinction is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:05.480" style="s2">conceptual distinction between</p>

<p begin="00:17:05.480" end="00:17:10.039" style="s2">and qualitative change so quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.400" end="00:17:12.230" style="s2">change is the increase in concept this</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.039" end="00:17:16.490" style="s2">is the idea you can use the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.230" end="00:17:18.470" style="s2">function and constantly acquire new</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.490" end="00:17:20.419" style="s2">information so let&#39;s say all think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.470" end="00:17:22.250" style="s2">all the information I can acquire suit</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.419" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">through an alphabetic literacy and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.250" end="00:17:26.949" style="s2">can keep acquiring more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:29.390" style="s2">more information that&#39;s quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.949" end="00:17:30.980" style="s2">qualitative change which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.390" end="00:17:32.450" style="s2">central to Piaget theory of development</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.980" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">because he has a stage one alert</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.450" end="00:17:37.130" style="s2">development and the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:39.590" style="s2">the stages are qualitative qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.130" end="00:17:41.390" style="s2">change is an increased on in just</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.590" end="00:17:46.340" style="s2">content more importantly it is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.390" end="00:17:49.700" style="s2">increase in competence it&#39;s an increase</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.340" end="00:17:52.159" style="s2">not in how much but an how many kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.700" end="00:17:54.440" style="s2">things can be knowing no it&#39;s in what</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.159" end="00:17:56.090" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is increasing the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.440" end="00:18:00.830" style="s2">things you can know by adding new</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.090" end="00:18:02.360" style="s2">functions so for example compare that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.830" end="00:18:04.610" style="s2">first situation where I stick with</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.360" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">literacy and all of the information I</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.610" end="00:18:09.140" style="s2">can represent with now this situation I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:12.770" style="s2">have literacy and then I added Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.140" end="00:18:15.230" style="s2">graphing now I can represent all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.770" end="00:18:16.039" style="s2">of information that I couldn&#39;t represent</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.230" end="00:18:17.690" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.039" end="00:18:20.629" style="s2">because I have a Cartesian graphing a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.690" end="00:18:26.899" style="s2">new function that&#39;s qualitative change</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.629" end="00:18:31.269" style="s2">does that make sense and it would really</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.899" end="00:18:31.269" style="s2">talking about transformation and growth</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.450" end="00:18:36.470" style="s2">development in a way that we find</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.460" end="00:18:38.840" style="s2">interesting then I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.470" end="00:18:44.499" style="s2">almost always talking about and assuming</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.840" end="00:18:47.989" style="s2">exists is qualitative change but Fodor</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.499" end="00:18:50.479" style="s2">famously claimed the Piaget&#39;s whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.989" end="00:18:55.909" style="s2">of qualitative change and qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.479" end="00:18:57.889" style="s2">development was false why would he come</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.909" end="00:18:59.720" style="s2">to such a strong conclusion well one is</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.889" end="00:19:01.249" style="s2">that he&#39;s Jerry P was Jerry Fodor than</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.720" end="00:19:03.950" style="s2">sort of always came to strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.249" end="00:19:08.090" style="s2">conclusions about everything you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.950" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">want to have dinner with Jake food so</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.090" end="00:19:11.539" style="s2">let&#39;s take three o&#39;clock photos the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:14.899" style="s2">employer famously was of the opinion</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.539" end="00:19:16.970" style="s2">that cognition is computation that a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.899" end="00:19:19.340" style="s2">cognitive process is a computational</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.970" end="00:19:21.109" style="s2">process what does he mean by that he</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.340" end="00:19:22.820" style="s2">means the inferential manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.109" end="00:19:24.649" style="s2">propositions that&#39;s what computation is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.820" end="00:19:26.509" style="s2">prepared the inferential manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.649" end="00:19:28.340" style="s2">propositions that means you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.509" end="00:19:31.820" style="s2">some kind of formal system you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.340" end="00:19:34.249" style="s2">a logic a logic is a formal system for</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.820" end="00:19:39.970" style="s2">guiding how you inferential e manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.249" end="00:19:39.970" style="s2">propositions that&#39;s what a logic is okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.080" end="00:19:47.570" style="s2">so what does further unexplained well</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.950" end="00:19:49.159" style="s2">let&#39;s get the notion that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.570" end="00:19:50.809" style="s2">talk about the strength of a logic</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.159" end="00:19:54.229" style="s2">because blood is getting weaker or</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.809" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">stronger what makes a logic stronger a</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.229" end="00:19:59.929" style="s2">logic is stronger if you can represent</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:20:01.399" style="s2">more kinds of arguments think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.929" end="00:20:05.330" style="s2">think about how this is matching up with</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.399" end="00:20:07.549" style="s2">qualitative change a stronger logic can</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.330" end="00:20:11.720" style="s2">represent more kinds of arguments it can</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.549" end="00:20:14.239" style="s2">implement more kinds of programs so a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.720" end="00:20:16.099" style="s2">very weak logic is propositional logic</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.239" end="00:20:19.399" style="s2">that&#39;s when you use variables like a or</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.099" end="00:20:20.690" style="s2">B to stand for entire compositions and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.399" end="00:20:22.249" style="s2">the problem with that is there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.690" end="00:20:24.590" style="s2">kinds of arguments you can&#39;t represent</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.249" end="00:20:27.229" style="s2">you can&#39;t represent arguments that make</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.590" end="00:20:29.269" style="s2">use of things like all or some because</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.229" end="00:20:31.700" style="s2">prop is propositional logic can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.269" end="00:20:33.619" style="s2">distinguish between all the time so what</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.700" end="00:20:35.450" style="s2">you do is to a stronger logic called</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.619" end="00:20:38.059" style="s2">predicate logic the predicate logic</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.450" end="00:20:40.549" style="s2">gives you ways of representing things</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.059" end="00:20:44.629" style="s2">like all or some arguments based on like</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.549" end="00:20:46.489" style="s2">all you know all cars are catalyzed some</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.629" end="00:20:52.609" style="s2">Cadillacs are broken does that mean all</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.489" end="00:20:56.269" style="s2">cars are broken the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.609" end="00:20:59.299" style="s2">logic is its weak in the sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.269" end="00:21:01.099" style="s2">can&#39;t represent other important kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.299" end="00:21:03.229" style="s2">arguments you want to make you make</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.099" end="00:21:05.779" style="s2">arguments that rely on necessity versus</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.229" end="00:21:08.989" style="s2">contingency it is necessarily the case</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.779" end="00:21:11.239" style="s2">that versus it is only possible that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.989" end="00:21:13.099" style="s2">so in order to do that you have down</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.239" end="00:21:15.019" style="s2">what&#39;s called modal logic you see how</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.099" end="00:21:17.239" style="s2">each logic is stronger than the logic</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.019" end="00:21:19.669" style="s2">before it because each logic can</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.239" end="00:21:25.879" style="s2">represent more kinds of arguments than</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.669" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">the logic before so if cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.879" end="00:21:30.769" style="s2">computation if cognition is largely the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:33.590" style="s2">inferential manipulation of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.769" end="00:21:38.530" style="s2">to change belief if that&#39;s the cognition</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.590" end="00:21:41.080" style="s2">is that qualitative change is has to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.530" end="00:21:42.850" style="s2">from a weaker logic to a stronger logic</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.080" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">that&#39;s how you make the qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.850" end="00:21:50.230" style="s2">change in cognition to a stronger logic</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:56.440" style="s2">because what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m adding</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.230" end="00:21:58.630" style="s2">functions so further I think very</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.440" end="00:22:01.150" style="s2">correctly argues that if you think</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.150" end="00:32:37.400" style="s2">is something external to the self</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.520" end="00:32:40.490" style="s2">actually introduces the needed novelty</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.490" end="00:32:45.560" style="s2">it&#39;s something other than me has driven</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.770" end="00:33:08.740" style="s2">objective way to drive self-creation</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.280" end="00:33:22.630" style="s2">thing as bro you should pack it all up</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:26.490" style="s2">and go home okay let&#39;s try and take this</p>

<p begin="00:33:26.490" end="00:33:30.970" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s take a look at</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">think therefore people in fact of doing</p>
