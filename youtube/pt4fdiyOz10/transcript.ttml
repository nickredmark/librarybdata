<p begin="00:01:45.789" end="00:01:50.350" style="s2">student but Mike saw something in him</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.890" end="00:01:53.590" style="s2">which was a great vision and a great</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.350" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">leadership and picked Howard first to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.590" end="00:01:58.899" style="s2">research about the shape of the new</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:01.600" style="s2">Institute they&#39;re talking about and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.899" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">to actually be the first director that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.600" end="00:02:05.740" style="s2">an amazing story that is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:08.770" style="s2">story and it still has to do with our</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.740" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">success as he stole very as the director</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.770" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">no he was the director until 2006 and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">then he left and now lives in the South</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:20.910" style="s2">of France where he has an interesting</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.910" end="00:02:25.380" style="s2">well life is good in the South of France</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">life is good in the South of France and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">he&#39;s there with his family our second</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:32.490" style="s2">director was Neil Turok</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">we just ended his ten-year to terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.490" end="00:02:39.230" style="s2">ten years and Howard put us on the map</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:41.640" style="s2">and gave us a set of principles and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.230" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">structure which was made us was quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.640" end="00:02:45.570" style="s2">distinctive and different than all the</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.570" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">in the world and Neil then took that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:54.060" style="s2">grew us by a factor of three into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:56.940" style="s2">formidable Centre for research I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.060" end="00:02:58.530" style="s2">really glad that the BlackBerry guy did</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.940" end="00:03:00.470" style="s2">that I mean that&#39;s a frankly a much</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.530" end="00:03:03.960" style="s2">better use of money than yet another</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.470" end="00:03:07.110" style="s2">200-foot yacht I would say yes no Mike</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.960" end="00:03:10.770" style="s2">Mike is a person with vision a person</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.110" end="00:03:13.140" style="s2">with enormous generosity and he his</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.770" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">initial contribution was a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:17.340" style="s2">million dollars which was made as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:20.850" style="s2">of challenge to the governments of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.340" end="00:03:23.340" style="s2">Canada to Ontario to match in that offer</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.850" end="00:03:26.280" style="s2">of match has been made twice more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.340" end="00:03:28.710" style="s2">that so his funding has been critical</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.280" end="00:03:30.330" style="s2">but close so has been funding from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.710" end="00:03:33.600" style="s2">province of Ontario and the Government</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.330" end="00:03:36.420" style="s2">of Canada we have strong support from</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.600" end="00:03:38.520" style="s2">the public from the governments and from</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.420" end="00:03:40.800" style="s2">the private sector and that gives us so</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.520" end="00:03:43.020" style="s2">formidable strength it gives us freedom</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.800" end="00:03:45.650" style="s2">indeed and you know I&#39;ve been associated</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.020" end="00:03:48.600" style="s2">with the Santa Fe Institute for the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.650" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">17 years and it has a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.600" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">trajectory but a similar story and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">it&#39;s an independent standalone Institute</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:57.990" style="s2">founded by a small group of visionaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:03:59.400" style="s2">and has gone on to do some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.990" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">interesting things though not at the</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.749" end="00:09:04.600" style="s2">because the options are limited and the</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.249" end="00:09:19.749" style="s2">have this interest because we care about</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.779" end="00:09:51.939" style="s2">of the 20th century it was instigated by</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.449" end="00:09:54.970" style="s2">Einstein and a few others by put into</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.939" end="00:09:57.459" style="s2">final form in the 1920s by a number of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.970" end="00:10:00.069" style="s2">people Niels Bohr Werner Heisenberg are</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.459" end="00:10:02.410" style="s2">two of the most prominent Wolfgang Pauli</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.069" end="00:10:05.019" style="s2">Paul Dirac and English smitten there</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.410" end="00:10:07.569" style="s2">were maybe half a dozen and these people</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.019" end="00:10:09.790" style="s2">were philosophically not inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.569" end="00:10:12.370" style="s2">realism for reasons of their own which</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.790" end="00:10:15.160" style="s2">is interesting to explore so they</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.370" end="00:10:17.949" style="s2">presented a theory in which randomness</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.160" end="00:10:20.019" style="s2">was fundamental in which there was no</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.949" end="00:10:23.319" style="s2">determinism and I can explain exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.019" end="00:10:25.240" style="s2">what it means why it lacks the idea the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.319" end="00:10:27.100" style="s2">things are determined as the future is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.240" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">determined from the past and the present</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.100" end="00:10:33.639" style="s2">and in the version of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:35.379" style="s2">that they proposed the state of a system</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.639" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">does depend on what you choose to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.379" end="00:10:38.949" style="s2">measure and what&#39;s true about a system</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">does depend to some extent on what</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.949" end="00:10:42.430" style="s2">questions us</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:45.399" style="s2">system so there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.430" end="00:10:48.370" style="s2">unification the way they saw it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.399" end="00:10:50.910" style="s2">unity not in the usual sense of unifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.370" end="00:10:53.500" style="s2">the different forces but in unity of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.910" end="00:10:56.170" style="s2">reality in the observer they saw the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.500" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">reality is something that is created by</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.170" end="00:11:02.260" style="s2">the observer as it tells the observer</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:06.220" style="s2">finds out about it he also influences</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.260" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">and constructs reality and this was very</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.220" end="00:11:11.769" style="s2">pleasing to those of that generation</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:15.070" style="s2">they thought that they saw it as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.769" end="00:11:17.589" style="s2">irrefutable and irreversible change and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.070" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">revolutionary change in the idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.589" end="00:11:22.779" style="s2">science is and how we relate to nature</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:24.910" style="s2">and it was repellent to those who had</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.779" end="00:11:27.339" style="s2">the older view that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.910" end="00:11:31.240" style="s2">independent of our talking and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.339" end="00:11:33.250" style="s2">about it ok so this was an anathema to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.240" end="00:11:36.190" style="s2">those who had the older more traditional</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.250" end="00:11:39.070" style="s2">notion of reality is independent of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.190" end="00:11:41.350" style="s2">knowledge and those included Einstein</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.350" end="00:11:48.069" style="s2">and so there are two groups would take a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.069" end="00:11:50.529" style="s2">widely different view and what they</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.069" end="00:11:52.540" style="s2">prescribe is different basically when</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.529" end="00:11:55.630" style="s2">you come to think about these questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.540" end="00:11:57.430" style="s2">you face a question there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.630" end="00:11:59.829" style="s2">branch in the road at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.430" end="00:12:02.019" style="s2">your thinking do you think that quantum</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.829" end="00:12:03.850" style="s2">mechanics is correct and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.019" end="00:12:05.949" style="s2">just how we think and talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.850" end="00:12:07.540" style="s2">whether the basic equations of basic</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.540" end="00:12:16.329" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in just having the</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.970" end="00:12:26.589" style="s2">and as you hinted there are lots of</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.930" end="00:12:37.420" style="s2">think the quantum mechanics lacks the</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.399" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2">at least to provide that background for</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.110" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">should say there are very few pure</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.940" end="00:13:40.250" style="s2">Copenhagen is left alive at this point</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:42.110" style="s2">but they were the first they recalled</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.250" end="00:13:44.420" style="s2">the Copenhagen interpretation because</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.110" end="00:13:46.430" style="s2">Niels Bohr who was the first person who</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.420" end="00:13:48.290" style="s2">successfully applied the ideas about</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.630" end="00:13:55.250" style="s2">orbitals and so forth so he was a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:57.079" style="s2">important scientist for the development</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.250" end="00:14:00.050" style="s2">to the theory and the Dutch government</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.079" end="00:14:03.589" style="s2">in conjunction with a beer company</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.050" end="00:14:05.959" style="s2">Carlsberg beer basically set him up in</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.970" end="00:14:19.010" style="s2">became the call that Niels Bohr</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.709" end="00:14:21.170" style="s2">Institute became the creative Center for</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.170" end="00:14:25.610" style="s2">the young people who played a key role</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:34.820" style="s2">there and so that&#39;s why this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.870" end="00:14:37.850" style="s2">ideas that they came up with are called</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.820" end="00:14:39.860" style="s2">the Copenhagen interpretation now to</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.860" end="00:14:44.870" style="s2">emphasize this is a more radical point</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.740" end="00:14:46.790" style="s2">of view than most people now think you</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.870" end="00:14:48.920" style="s2">have to go to make sense of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.790" end="00:14:51.380" style="s2">mechanics but it&#39;s very evocative and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.920" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a good place to start Niels Bohr</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.380" end="00:14:55.160" style="s2">for example talked about the question of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:55.940" style="s2">whether the electron is a wave or a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.160" end="00:14:59.089" style="s2">particle</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.940" end="00:15:00.680" style="s2">Einstein had shaken the world up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.089" end="00:15:03.709" style="s2">this was the first intimations of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.680" end="00:15:06.740" style="s2">quantum physics in about 1905 when he</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.709" end="00:15:09.020" style="s2">talked about light being both waves and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.740" end="00:15:09.770" style="s2">a particle and seeming to have aspects</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.020" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">of both</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.770" end="00:15:13.790" style="s2">nature&#39;s and that&#39;s almost paradoxical</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:15.589" style="s2">because the wave is something which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.790" end="00:15:18.410" style="s2">spread out and flows through all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.589" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">available space open to it but as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.410" end="00:15:22.100" style="s2">particle is always on a trajectory and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.380" style="s2">it&#39;s always somewhere and I was always</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.100" end="00:15:25.730" style="s2">going somewhere so waves and particles</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.380" end="00:15:28.850" style="s2">are quite different</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.730" end="00:15:31.670" style="s2">what Bors said is that an electron or a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:35.390" style="s2">photon is neither a wave nor particle</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.670" end="00:15:38.209" style="s2">these are the human invented conceptions</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.390" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">that we impose on not the particle but</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.209" end="00:15:42.529" style="s2">the whole experiments we set up designed</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:44.089" style="s2">to reveal the nature of the particle and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.529" end="00:15:46.819" style="s2">there are some experiments which are</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.089" end="00:15:49.610" style="s2">naturally it&#39;s designed to bring out the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.819" end="00:15:51.620" style="s2">wave properties of a photon there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.610" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">the experiments which are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.620" end="00:15:56.390" style="s2">bring out the particle properties so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:58.220" style="s2">use these languages we choose which</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.390" end="00:16:00.529" style="s2">language is most appropriate for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.220" end="00:16:02.690" style="s2">whole experimental situation and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.529" end="00:16:04.430" style="s2">demand only one thing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.690" end="00:16:06.410" style="s2">consistency which is if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.430" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">experiment that will lead us to try to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:10.279" style="s2">use the wave picture in the particle</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">picture at the same time and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.279" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">risk contradicting ourselves and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:19.069" style="s2">style of thought that the world could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:20.569" style="s2">fully described only by properties which</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.069" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">contradict each other if they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.569" end="00:16:24.649" style="s2">forced to be used at the same time but</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.569" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">had made a great philosophical discovery</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.640" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">in fact he thought he had gotten it from</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.770" end="00:20:13.030" style="s2">lay out where the realist branch came</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.650" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">so the original realist was of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.230" end="00:20:26.140" style="s2">Einstein and Einstein objected very</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:05.800" style="s2">important universally admired because he</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.910" end="00:21:08.170" style="s2">had taken the idea of the wave particle</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.170" end="00:21:13.000" style="s2">forward and said also an electron could</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.920" end="00:21:24.010" style="s2">I would have both wave and particle</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.100" end="00:21:59.169" style="s2">say what&#39;s the resolution of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.379" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">how do you from a realist point of view</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.169" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">avoid the idea of complementarity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:07.299" style="s2">observer dependence and observer</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:09.909" style="s2">intervention he said well let&#39;s suppose</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.299" end="00:22:13.029" style="s2">that there are both waves and particles</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.909" end="00:22:15.309" style="s2">and there&#39;s always a way then it flows</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.309" end="00:22:19.629" style="s2">available paths and it&#39;s always a</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.629" end="00:22:24.070" style="s2">is known as a guidance wave and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.610" end="00:22:26.169" style="s2">guides the particle and so this double</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.169" end="00:22:30.879" style="s2">particles to probably developed and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.299" end="00:22:33.549" style="s2">proposed he called it the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.879" end="00:22:35.940" style="s2">wave theory because the wave was a pilot</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.549" end="00:22:38.590" style="s2">or a guide to the particle and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.940" end="00:22:41.860" style="s2">predictions and explanations which were</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.590" end="00:22:43.960" style="s2">the equivalent to many cases in a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.860" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">cases better than those given by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.960" end="00:22:48.429" style="s2">quantum mechanics that his colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:50.669" style="s2">had developed so there was from the very</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.429" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">beginning of the subject a realist</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.669" end="00:22:56.830" style="s2">alternative this pilot wave theory</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:59.259" style="s2">Einstein had turned out had also come</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.830" end="00:23:01.870" style="s2">upon that idea and it had written down a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.259" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">pilot wave theory for photons which he</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.870" end="00:23:06.460" style="s2">however found some problems with and got</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:08.289" style="s2">discouraged and although he wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.460" end="00:23:10.360" style="s2">paper about it it was doing it for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.289" end="00:23:12.850" style="s2">publication and he never presented it</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.360" end="00:23:14.950" style="s2">and never much talked about it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.850" end="00:23:18.309" style="s2">Einstein did also consider that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.950" end="00:23:21.610" style="s2">alternative so it&#39;s a kind of a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.309" end="00:23:24.429" style="s2">for example in 1927 there was the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.610" end="00:23:26.860" style="s2">conference which was held in Brussels</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.429" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">called the soul of a conference were all</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.860" end="00:23:30.220" style="s2">the important people in quantum</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:32.200" style="s2">mechanics got together for the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.220" end="00:23:34.690" style="s2">time and gave talks to each other about</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.200" end="00:23:35.110" style="s2">the new physics and debris was there and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.690" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.110" end="00:23:40.120" style="s2">was there and debris presented his part</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.860" style="s2">of the way theory so there was no excuse</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.120" end="00:23:43.960" style="s2">not to know about it that all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.860" end="00:23:45.850" style="s2">founders must have been aware of it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.960" end="00:23:48.130" style="s2">it was never taken up it was never</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.850" end="00:23:50.220" style="s2">taught it was never made part of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.130" end="00:23:53.080" style="s2">theory that was described in textbooks</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.220" end="00:23:55.809" style="s2">it was as if he didn&#39;t exist in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.080" end="00:23:57.220" style="s2">certain sense why was that do you think</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.809" end="00:24:00.340" style="s2">well how do you think that his</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.220" end="00:24:02.740" style="s2">pilot-wave theory was almost erased from</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.340" end="00:24:06.549" style="s2">history it&#39;s a very interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.740" end="00:24:08.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a question about history of science</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.549" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">and the sociology and psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.500" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">scientists which are not feels that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:16.540" style="s2">expert in let me mention one part of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:18.250" style="s2">a very important mathematician of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.540" end="00:24:21.940" style="s2">day was somebody called John von Neumann</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.250" end="00:24:24.549" style="s2">a Hungarian of that same generation and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.940" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">indeed von Neumann did many important</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.549" end="00:24:28.510" style="s2">things one of them was he invented the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:30.940" style="s2">standards computer architecture in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.510" end="00:24:33.640" style="s2">1940s that all the computers used now</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.940" end="00:24:36.520" style="s2">with memory separated from processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.640" end="00:24:38.440" style="s2">for example with his innovation and but</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.520" end="00:24:41.380" style="s2">he was a very important mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.440" end="00:24:44.230" style="s2">all over the field of mathematics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.380" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">science and engineering this is how it</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.230" end="00:24:50.410" style="s2">which is to say he was a very admired</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:52.540" style="s2">and influential guy and in 1933 I</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.410" end="00:24:54.130" style="s2">believe he published a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.540" end="00:24:55.630" style="s2">mathematical principles of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.130" end="00:24:57.790" style="s2">mechanics in which he gave a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.630" end="00:24:59.860" style="s2">mathematical proof that there could be</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.790" end="00:25:02.049" style="s2">no alternative that a theory that was</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.900" end="00:25:09.010" style="s2">have to be self contradictory or</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:59.160" style="s2">myself as a biographer I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.940" end="00:30:01.920" style="s2">great history of science in history in</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.920" end="00:30:06.570" style="s2">one aspect of it let me leave as a hint</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.050" end="00:30:08.730" style="s2">is that David Bohm and Einstein were</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.570" end="00:30:10.770" style="s2">very friendly and most of that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.730" end="00:30:14.940" style="s2">unrecorded but they seem to have had</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.770" end="00:30:16.740" style="s2">some mutual friends in the area and to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.940" end="00:30:19.620" style="s2">have communicated through these mutual</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.740" end="00:30:22.350" style="s2">friends and it was Einstein you see let</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.620" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">me go back a step why did David Bohm</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.350" end="00:30:26.940" style="s2">come to invent this reinvent this</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:29.820" style="s2">pilot-wave theory which gave a realist</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.940" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">perspective on quantum mechanics well it</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.010" end="00:30:37.050" style="s2">plasma physicist and the but he decided</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.010" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">to write a textbook on Harlan mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.050" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">because teaching quantum mechanics was</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:43.350" style="s2">one of his duties at Princeton and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:45.540" style="s2">was dissatisfied with the textbooks that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.350" end="00:30:47.370" style="s2">existed so he wrote a brilliant textbook</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.540" end="00:30:50.010" style="s2">which is still used sometimes to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.370" end="00:30:53.030" style="s2">day which gave a strict</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.030" end="00:30:59.970" style="s2">and Einstein the legend goes called them</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.490" end="00:31:01.290" style="s2">in Sora&#39;s textbook and called him in for</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.970" end="00:31:04.130" style="s2">a discussion they were apparently</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.290" end="00:31:07.490" style="s2">already so much friendly and Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.130" end="00:31:10.710" style="s2">somehow gave him enough of a talking to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.490" end="00:31:12.930" style="s2">that it made David Bohm go back and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.710" end="00:31:15.480" style="s2">reconsider what he had written in</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.480" end="00:31:19.770" style="s2">led directly to his playing around with</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.380" end="00:33:45.780" style="s2">something that the experimentalist study</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.810" end="00:33:49.230" style="s2">and control indeed think of it almost as</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.780" end="00:33:51.720" style="s2">an engineering resource so this property</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.230" end="00:33:54.420" style="s2">of entanglement should sound strange to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.720" end="00:33:56.100" style="s2">somebody because it means if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.420" end="00:33:58.140" style="s2">way in which the two particles are</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.140" end="00:34:04.050" style="s2">from each other and that violates the</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:45.610" style="s2">this if I&#39;m off that modern experimental</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:34:59.560" style="s2">Podolsky and Nathan Rosen fashioned an</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.420" end="00:35:15.820" style="s2">influences was wrong so their conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.120" end="00:35:18.370" style="s2">could not be held but nonetheless the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.820" end="00:35:20.110" style="s2">paper was a breakthrough paper because</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.370" end="00:35:22.870" style="s2">it led to the recognition of this</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.510" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">is an Irish physicist called John Bell</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.120" end="00:35:37.090" style="s2">who was a particle physicist and he came</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:40.510" style="s2">along in the 1960s and he fashioned an</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.090" end="00:35:43.600" style="s2">elementary very easy to formulate and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.510" end="00:35:45.730" style="s2">check and prove theorem that if locality</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.600" end="00:35:47.830" style="s2">were true in cases like this where two</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.730" end="00:35:50.080" style="s2">particles interact and then separated</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.830" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">then there was a certain constraint on</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.080" end="00:35:55.030" style="s2">measured values of certain correlations</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:57.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason to explain it here</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.030" end="00:36:00.370" style="s2">to your viewers you could describe he</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.670" end="00:36:02.890" style="s2">could derive a certain constraint on</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.370" end="00:36:05.620" style="s2">measured values in some experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.890" end="00:36:07.960" style="s2">the assumption was that when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.620" end="00:36:10.060" style="s2">particles were very far apart that wet</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.960" end="00:36:12.490" style="s2">one choose to measure of one of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.060" end="00:36:14.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t affect what&#39;s true about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.490" end="00:36:16.150" style="s2">other one and if you&#39;re a realist and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.440" end="00:36:18.940" style="s2">you believe in locality how could it be</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.150" end="00:36:21.250" style="s2">that whether I choose to measure the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.940" end="00:36:23.260" style="s2">or the momentum or something else Oh a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.250" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">particle that&#39;s come over here to my</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.260" end="00:36:27.130" style="s2">laboratory shouldn&#39;t affect it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:29.650" style="s2">that that shouldn&#39;t affect what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.130" end="00:36:31.660" style="s2">about a particle that maybe now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.650" end="00:36:34.930" style="s2">around somewhere around Mars or Jupiter</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.660" end="00:36:38.140" style="s2">and just making this assumption which we</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.930" end="00:36:40.809" style="s2">call now Bell locality but I&#39;ll prove</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.140" end="00:36:43.000" style="s2">this inequality had to be true about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.809" end="00:36:45.190" style="s2">measured values of certain observables</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.000" end="00:36:47.109" style="s2">and then he could do the calculation in</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.190" end="00:36:48.930" style="s2">quantum mechanics and show that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.109" end="00:36:51.309" style="s2">values predicted by quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.930" end="00:36:53.260" style="s2">contradicted the inequality so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.309" end="00:36:55.299" style="s2">meant that that property was false in</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.260" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">quantum mechanics but the dramatic thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.299" end="00:37:00.670" style="s2">which was demonstrated a decade later</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:02.740" style="s2">starting the 1970s is that people could</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.670" end="00:37:04.450" style="s2">do the experiment and find that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.740" end="00:37:07.089" style="s2">inequality was violated in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.450" end="00:37:09.730" style="s2">experiment so without any reference to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.089" end="00:37:12.579" style="s2">quantum mechanics we have tested this</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.730" end="00:37:14.349" style="s2">assumption about locality and it&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.579" end="00:37:17.349" style="s2">and not just by a little bit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.349" end="00:37:19.660" style="s2">dramatically false I think this was big</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.349" end="00:37:23.799" style="s2">this is a big story for our listeners is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.660" end="00:37:27.539" style="s2">that realism can include nonlocality</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.799" end="00:37:31.660" style="s2">no Jim let me put it to you stronger</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.539" end="00:37:34.420" style="s2">realism or non realism nonlocality is</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.660" end="00:37:37.829" style="s2">part of nature this experiment doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.420" end="00:37:41.470" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t sue many philosophy of nature</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.829" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">it just describes certain correlations</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.960" style="s2">assumption I believe me people have</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.980" end="00:37:52.299" style="s2">combed this thing it&#39;s a very short</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.960" end="00:37:54.549" style="s2">paper there&#39;s not much to it the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.299" end="00:37:56.890" style="s2">assumptions you go into the calculation</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.549" end="00:37:59.260" style="s2">or trivial things like probabilities and</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.260" end="00:38:03.369" style="s2">can try to disbelieve if you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.270" end="00:38:04.900" style="s2">out of it but I think everybody would</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.369" end="00:38:06.579" style="s2">agree that this probability means</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.900" end="00:38:10.119" style="s2">anything the probability is something to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.579" end="00:38:12.099" style="s2">happen is between zero and one so people</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.119" end="00:38:15.069" style="s2">have looked for a loophole people look</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.099" end="00:38:17.859" style="s2">for mistakes and it&#39;s pretty remarkably</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.069" end="00:38:20.109" style="s2">solid at this point those of us have</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.859" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">looked into this as educated layman</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.109" end="00:38:24.789" style="s2">have seen the claims that despite the</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.420" end="00:38:48.910" style="s2">beginning of the show because if we look</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.910" end="00:38:53.560" style="s2">outcomes are random it&#39;s only when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.130" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">look at the correlations of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.560" end="00:38:58.089" style="s2">statistics that you get by averaging</p>

<p begin="00:39:09.910" end="00:39:14.589" style="s2">because quantum mechanics and quantum</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.780" end="00:39:34.450" style="s2">mechanics you have to make an assumption</p>

<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:34.450" style="s2">distribution related to the wave what</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.829" end="00:40:37.450" style="s2">you can show is that once you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.450" end="00:40:39.910" style="s2">that initially it stays that way so that</p>

<p begin="00:41:09.829" end="00:41:15.020" style="s2">happens then and he called that being</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.710" end="00:41:17.810" style="s2">out of equilibrium or out of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.020" end="00:41:20.450" style="s2">equilibrium and the Antony Valentini was</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.810" end="00:41:22.520" style="s2">able to prove two remarkable results</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.450" end="00:41:25.460" style="s2">about that one of them is that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.520" end="00:41:27.770" style="s2">system will evolve in time so there</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.460" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">pretty quickly it gets back to the born</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.770" end="00:41:31.670" style="s2">rule so even if you start off with a</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:33.260" style="s2">probability distribution for the initial</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.670" end="00:41:35.720" style="s2">particle it&#39;s different than the square</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.260" end="00:41:37.970" style="s2">of the waves everything somehow</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.720" end="00:41:41.210" style="s2">conspires so that pretty soon the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.970" end="00:41:43.160" style="s2">distribution is the same the same one is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.210" end="00:41:46.010" style="s2">like the square of the way that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:43:49.740" end="00:43:56.580" style="s2">proceeded is cosmology because meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.580" end="00:43:58.830" style="s2">in Stein invented general relativity and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.580" end="00:44:01.230" style="s2">people began to apply it tomorrows of</p>

<p begin="00:44:08.550" end="00:44:12.840" style="s2">so what does that have to do with</p>

<p begin="00:44:12.840" end="00:44:17.790" style="s2">mechanics can be applied to a part of</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.740" end="00:49:58.590" style="s2">who wrote this 1957 and a number of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.130" end="00:50:03.210" style="s2">people since who attempted to make use</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.590" end="00:50:05.550" style="s2">of it and and this kind of this is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.210" end="00:50:07.350" style="s2">in an area where I work directly but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.550" end="00:50:09.570" style="s2">certainly know many of these people and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.350" end="00:50:12.840" style="s2">admire many of them even if I find the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.570" end="00:50:15.210" style="s2">idea very unsettling and unconvincing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.840" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of first stage where</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.210" end="00:50:19.020" style="s2">people finally realized that ever it</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:21.450" style="s2">didn&#39;t have all the answers and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.850" end="00:50:28.290" style="s2">questions it must and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.860" end="00:50:30.050" style="s2">group of mainly philosophers although</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.290" end="00:50:32.790" style="s2">they&#39;re led by one brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.050" end="00:50:35.340" style="s2">iconoclastic physicist David Deutsch was</p>

<p begin="00:50:35.340" end="00:50:40.260" style="s2">as I disagree with him about so many</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.260" end="00:50:45.510" style="s2">and his books are very worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.330" end="00:50:48.180" style="s2">very provocative so David Deutsch and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.510" end="00:50:49.950" style="s2">then a number of philosophers at Oxford</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.180" end="00:50:52.260" style="s2">University made a much more</p>

<p begin="00:51:10.500" end="00:51:15.930" style="s2">called decision theory so it was David&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.470" end="00:51:18.570" style="s2">brilliant idea to apply decision theory</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.930" end="00:51:20.220" style="s2">to this question that is if you were an</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.220" end="00:51:25.740" style="s2">world there are no probabilities but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.500" end="00:51:28.740" style="s2">still have to make bets and what guides</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.740" end="00:51:31.230" style="s2">what wisdom guides the bet you make when</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.740" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">you bet how whether which branch you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.230" end="00:51:36.930" style="s2">gonna be on when where the particle went</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:39.869" style="s2">left of the particle went right and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.930" end="00:51:42.420" style="s2">this is a new part of the subject and</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.869" end="00:51:45.090" style="s2">there are lots of ins and outs of it so</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.420" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">here&#39;s what I regressed for the reader</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.090" end="00:51:49.830" style="s2">so I wrote these two stages in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">development of the theory became two</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:56.520" style="s2">chapters in my book the chapters 10 and</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.640" end="00:52:04.230" style="s2">confess that I kind of misjudged how</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.470" end="00:52:05.790" style="s2">hard these things were and probably we</p>

<p begin="00:52:37.589" end="00:52:43.020" style="s2">conversation I had with Murray gell-mann</p>

<p begin="00:52:43.020" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">one of the joys of being a researcher</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.180" end="00:52:48.869" style="s2">there was you got to hang out with</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:51.690" style="s2">people like Murray and you know just</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.869" end="00:52:54.000" style="s2">have random discussions and I went down</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.690" end="00:52:55.140" style="s2">the quantum interpretations discussion</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.000" end="00:52:56.700" style="s2">with him one day and said hey Murray</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.140" end="00:53:00.089" style="s2">what do you think and I realized he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.700" end="00:53:02.849" style="s2">written on this but he gave me a</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.089" end="00:53:05.460" style="s2">shorthand answer which I have not been</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.849" end="00:53:07.500" style="s2">able to find him ever putting in writing</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.460" end="00:53:10.320" style="s2">which he called the as if many-worlds</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.500" end="00:53:12.750" style="s2">interpretation he said you know about</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.320" end="00:53:16.020" style="s2">Everett his multiverse and I said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.750" end="00:53:19.140" style="s2">he says imagine Everett is right about</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.020" end="00:53:22.440" style="s2">the math but by some magical mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.140" end="00:53:25.560" style="s2">which we do not understand only one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.440" end="00:53:27.820" style="s2">the worlds actually happens at each such</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.560" end="00:53:30.760" style="s2">branch he says that</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.820" end="00:53:33.310" style="s2">was his best gut gifts of the best</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.760" end="00:53:35.860" style="s2">interpretation out there doesn&#39;t say I</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.310" end="00:53:39.850" style="s2">never heard him say that either but</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.860" end="00:53:42.010" style="s2">Murray did write a number of papers on</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.850" end="00:53:44.770" style="s2">the interpretation of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.010" end="00:53:46.990" style="s2">most of them with Jim Hartle who was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.770" end="00:53:48.280" style="s2">good friend of his and they espouse</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.990" end="00:53:50.560" style="s2">something that they called the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.280" end="00:53:52.630" style="s2">consistent histories interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.560" end="00:53:54.310" style="s2">quantum mechanics which I suppose is</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.630" end="00:53:58.570" style="s2">something like what you just described</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.310" end="00:54:00.580" style="s2">it&#39;s an average plus roofer when you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.570" end="00:54:03.070" style="s2">regard the world as real rather than</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.580" end="00:54:05.770" style="s2">just a fictional possibility he</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.070" end="00:54:07.810" style="s2">certainly seemed to be a real estimate</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.770" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">he would denounce people that remember</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.810" end="00:54:10.450" style="s2">him saying once yeah some people say if</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:12.070" style="s2">you don&#39;t look at the moon it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.450" end="00:54:14.140" style="s2">really there that&#39;s ridiculous the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.070" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">moon&#39;s always been there so he would</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.140" end="00:54:17.350" style="s2">certainly seem to have been on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:18.970" style="s2">realist side of your realist</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.350" end="00:54:22.570" style="s2">non-realistic I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.970" end="00:54:25.960" style="s2">he was Jim Harlow was more adventurous</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.570" end="00:54:28.930" style="s2">in his anti-realism he basically said</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.960" end="00:54:31.300" style="s2">realism surrealism we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.930" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">other people&#39;s theories on the realist</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.300" end="00:54:37.300" style="s2">branch Lee what&#39;s your program what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:41.110" style="s2">your best ideas about quantum</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.300" end="00:54:43.600" style="s2">foundations so Jim I see the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.110" end="00:54:46.600" style="s2">quantum foundations as part and parcel</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.600" end="00:54:49.480" style="s2">of the problem of quantum gravity the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.600" end="00:54:52.420" style="s2">problem of how to unify quantum physics</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.480" end="00:54:55.540" style="s2">with our understanding of space and time</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.420" end="00:54:57.550" style="s2">and gravity which mostly but most of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.540" end="00:54:59.340" style="s2">what we know about that is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.550" end="00:55:01.960" style="s2">Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.340" end="00:55:04.150" style="s2">so one way to think about this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.960" end="00:55:07.540" style="s2">unifying quantum mechanics with general</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.150" end="00:55:10.390" style="s2">relativity and to me that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.540" end="00:55:11.020" style="s2">by Einstein&#39;s unfinished revolution I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.390" end="00:55:14.140" style="s2">saying</p>

<p begin="00:55:14.140" end="00:55:19.330" style="s2">for the special theory in there in 1915</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.900" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">ten years later the general theory which</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.330" end="00:55:24.430" style="s2">included space and time and gravity and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:26.590" style="s2">at the same time in 1905 he instigated</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.430" end="00:55:28.450" style="s2">the quantum revolution and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.590" end="00:55:32.050" style="s2">both revolutions are still in progress</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.450" end="00:55:32.760" style="s2">and will culminate simultaneously so for</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.050" end="00:55:35.790" style="s2">me the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.760" end="00:55:38.370" style="s2">this clue is what we&#39;re talking about a</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.370" end="00:55:44.340" style="s2">quantum mechanics is describing a world</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.560" end="00:55:47.160" style="s2">somehow hidden behind our world in which</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.340" end="00:55:49.290" style="s2">space is not fundamental in which</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.160" end="00:55:51.030" style="s2">whether two particles interact has</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.290" end="00:55:52.890" style="s2">something to do with their history but</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.030" end="00:55:55.020" style="s2">not with whether they&#39;re near to each</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.890" end="00:55:56.910" style="s2">other or far to each other at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.020" end="00:55:58.920" style="s2">in other words entanglement to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.910" end="00:56:01.950" style="s2">entanglement is more fundamental than</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.920" end="00:56:05.070" style="s2">space and so I have a program of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.950" end="00:56:07.650" style="s2">research designed to find the completion</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.070" end="00:56:09.630" style="s2">the theory which is the completion both</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.630" end="00:56:16.350" style="s2">and gravity and our theory of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.570" end="00:56:18.060" style="s2">phenomenon and I&#39;m a realist I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.350" end="00:56:21.090" style="s2">very much so so I don&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.060" end="00:56:24.360" style="s2">compromises with complementarity or</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.090" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">Copenhagen now I believe three other</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.360" end="00:56:29.550" style="s2">things to put everything on the table</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:32.970" style="s2">one of them is that between space and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.550" end="00:56:35.700" style="s2">time time is really real time is</p>

<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:57:00.120" style="s2">believe that what&#39;s real and what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.660" end="00:57:02.040" style="s2">in the world is the present moment which</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.880" end="00:57:11.100" style="s2">is that I follow the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.800" end="00:57:14.010" style="s2">Einstein and Mark and going back to some</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.100" end="00:57:16.020" style="s2">great philosopher called lightness but</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.010" end="00:57:18.630" style="s2">the quantities that physics is</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.020" end="00:57:21.360" style="s2">interested in like motion and position</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.630" end="00:57:23.310" style="s2">and state are all about relationships</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.360" end="00:57:25.500" style="s2">they&#39;re about relationships of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.310" end="00:57:27.960" style="s2">particle or the system we&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.500" end="00:57:29.970" style="s2">with the rest of the universe there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.960" end="00:57:32.100" style="s2">no absolute properties there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.970" end="00:57:35.370" style="s2">absolute meaning to where something is</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.100" end="00:57:37.860" style="s2">or how it&#39;s moving all of these are are</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.370" end="00:57:40.650" style="s2">aspects of relationships so I try to</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.860" end="00:57:43.890" style="s2">construct a theory that is realist that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.650" end="00:57:46.710" style="s2">is present is that is relation list</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.890" end="00:57:49.079" style="s2">and that can give us back in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.710" end="00:57:51.299" style="s2">appropriate approximation quantum theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.079" end="00:57:53.849" style="s2">and general relativity so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.299" end="00:57:56.910" style="s2">a tall order that that&#39;s the world that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.849" end="00:57:58.230" style="s2">I plan it goes that I work for I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.910" end="00:58:00.539" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.230" end="00:58:02.609" style="s2">a parallax so to speak on the problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.539" end="00:58:05.220" style="s2">you know people working just in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.609" end="00:58:08.039" style="s2">quantum world are looking at nuances</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.220" end="00:58:10.140" style="s2">there you&#39;re looking at it from both</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.039" end="00:58:13.019" style="s2">within the quantum world but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.140" end="00:58:15.269" style="s2">looking at it from the the relativistic</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.019" end="00:58:17.549" style="s2">large scale at the same time this may</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.269" end="00:58:20.880" style="s2">give you a unique way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.549" end="00:58:24.210" style="s2">the problem yes I think it gives me a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.880" end="00:58:27.150" style="s2">lot of ingredients and direction I agree</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.210" end="00:58:29.700" style="s2">with that I should also say that I have</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.150" end="00:58:32.789" style="s2">wonderful company at different stages</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.700" end="00:58:35.730" style="s2">this work I&#39;ve been definitely blessed</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.789" end="00:58:39.569" style="s2">to have good collaborators and people</p>

<p begin="00:58:42.809" end="00:58:48.299" style="s2">want to mention them Roberto mangabeira</p>

<p begin="00:58:51.690" end="00:58:57.150" style="s2">because without them I would really be</p>

<p begin="01:01:05.220" end="01:01:09.750" style="s2">and it also struck me that maybe there</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.800" end="01:01:15.060" style="s2">was an experimental way to see if that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.750" end="01:01:17.579" style="s2">was true well maybe and we spend some</p>

<p begin="01:01:17.579" end="01:01:23.970" style="s2">was one paper that I wrote with the</p>

<p begin="01:01:49.180" end="01:01:54.250" style="s2">in now so as I said mostly I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.630" end="01:01:56.740" style="s2">working on quantum gravity and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.250" end="01:01:59.650" style="s2">occasionally other questions but every</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.740" end="01:02:01.510" style="s2">five or so years I went back and thought</p>

<p begin="01:02:01.510" end="01:02:06.070" style="s2">foundations and got a little further I</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.180" end="01:02:08.830" style="s2">knew a little more and had a little</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.070" end="01:02:11.110" style="s2">different toolkit and developed a</p>

<p begin="01:02:21.940" end="01:02:28.050" style="s2">kind of culmination of three different</p>

<p begin="01:06:30.489" end="01:06:34.779" style="s2">life has sprouted and where intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.769" end="01:06:37.239" style="s2">life is likely to sprout and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.779" end="01:06:39.789" style="s2">question I asked is first question I</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.239" end="01:06:41.529" style="s2">asked is what&#39;s the time period under</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.789" end="01:06:43.989" style="s2">which we can expect them to check back</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.529" end="01:06:46.779" style="s2">and I thought a few hundred million</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.989" end="01:06:49.679" style="s2">years and that&#39;s also because that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.779" end="01:06:53.229" style="s2">long it would take life to evolve from</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.679" end="01:06:55.689" style="s2">say a stage of just prokaryotes in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.229" end="01:06:57.699" style="s2">ocean in primitive ocean to more</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.689" end="01:07:01.239" style="s2">sophisticated eukaryotes and</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.699" end="01:07:03.369" style="s2">multicellular creatures and you&#39;d only</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.239" end="01:07:05.349" style="s2">have to check back every few hundred</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.369" end="01:07:09.069" style="s2">million years to get an idea of what was</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.349" end="01:07:11.769" style="s2">brewing so to speak and also how long it</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.069" end="01:07:14.890" style="s2">would take to cross the galaxy had a</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.769" end="01:07:17.109" style="s2">fraction of the speed of life figured</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.890" end="01:07:19.900" style="s2">into that so anyway I said so something</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.109" end="01:07:22.689" style="s2">between ten and a hundred a few hundred</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.900" end="01:07:25.119" style="s2">million years then the second question I</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.689" end="01:07:27.269" style="s2">asked coming from that is let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.119" end="01:07:31.150" style="s2">ourselves in their situation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.269" end="01:07:34.599" style="s2">here on a primitive earth they see maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.150" end="01:07:38.380" style="s2">some life in the ocean maybe some plants</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.599" end="01:07:41.979" style="s2">maybe even some very primitive land</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.380" end="01:07:45.219" style="s2">animals and they aren&#39;t gonna come back</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.979" end="01:07:48.519" style="s2">every few hundred million years but just</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.219" end="01:07:51.640" style="s2">in case some intelligent life develops</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.519" end="01:07:54.339" style="s2">quickly unexpectedly before that time or</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.640" end="01:07:56.859" style="s2">maybe intelligent life visits from</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.339" end="01:07:59.289" style="s2">somewhere else which is also possible</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.859" end="01:08:01.449" style="s2">well they would like to leave a message</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.289" end="01:08:03.999" style="s2">where would they leave a message that</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.449" end="01:08:07.299" style="s2">could last a hundred million years so</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.999" end="01:08:08.920" style="s2">that if any intelligent life evolved who</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.299" end="01:08:10.840" style="s2">came by</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.920" end="01:08:13.660" style="s2">they could leave a record of how to get</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.840" end="01:08:16.930" style="s2">in touch and I thought about that and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.660" end="01:08:18.790" style="s2">discussed it with a few friends and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.930" end="01:08:21.160" style="s2">conclusion I came to is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.790" end="01:08:23.170" style="s2">only one reliable place they could leave</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.160" end="01:08:25.450" style="s2">it and that&#39;s in the junk DNA you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.170" end="01:08:28.300" style="s2">whatever species they find in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.450" end="01:08:32.500" style="s2">mitochondrial DNA because that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.300" end="01:08:35.500" style="s2">undergo sexual division and selection so</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.500" end="01:08:38.890" style="s2">I suggested and I don&#39;t know if anybody</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.500" end="01:08:41.770" style="s2">ever took this up going through the junk</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.890" end="01:08:44.500" style="s2">DNA or the mitochondrial DNA of a number</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.770" end="01:08:48.160" style="s2">of species looking for artificial</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.500" end="01:08:51.580" style="s2">messages or patterns of signals patterns</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.160" end="01:08:54.070" style="s2">of the car genetic code that would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.580" end="01:08:57.190" style="s2">through its formal structure unlikely to</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.070" end="01:08:59.260" style="s2">have been generated naturally by natural</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.190" end="01:09:03.070" style="s2">selection wouldn&#39;t that signal have been</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.260" end="01:09:06.300" style="s2">scrambled by now by mutations maybe but</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.070" end="01:09:09.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a mutation rate and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.300" end="01:09:12.640" style="s2">mitochondrial DNA the mutation rate is</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.130" end="01:09:14.320" style="s2">all that matters in the rate here of DNA</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.640" end="01:09:16.780" style="s2">of course it&#39;s scrambled every</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.320" end="01:09:18.910" style="s2">generation sexually yeah and also by</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.780" end="01:09:21.250" style="s2">things like crossover would sir you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.910" end="01:09:22.240" style="s2">above and beyond the normal sexual</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.250" end="01:09:23.950" style="s2">reproduction</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.240" end="01:09:25.360" style="s2">I would agree mitochondria be in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.950" end="01:09:27.400" style="s2">right place would have to look and see</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.360" end="01:09:30.700" style="s2">what the base rate mutation is on base</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.400" end="01:09:32.260" style="s2">pairs and mitochondrial DNA and then of</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.700" end="01:09:34.330" style="s2">course all many of those likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.260" end="01:09:36.490" style="s2">fatal because the mitochondria DNA it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.330" end="01:09:38.200" style="s2">small and it&#39;s very key to our</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.490" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">metabolism but anyway that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.200" end="01:09:43.480" style="s2">interesting idea for any biochemists out</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:43.660" style="s2">there to pick up Lee&#39;s idea and run with</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.480" end="01:09:46.870" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.660" end="01:09:48.370" style="s2">trait I haven&#39;t Jim I haven&#39;t gone back</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.870" end="01:09:52.060" style="s2">and thought about it much since that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.370" end="01:09:54.070" style="s2">book which was 1997 let me ask you about</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.060" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">another one of your ideas from the past</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.070" end="01:10:01.060" style="s2">the idea that our universe is a child of</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:03.960" style="s2">a previous universe which is a child of</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.060" end="01:10:06.340" style="s2">a previous universe universe is bloomed</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.960" end="01:10:10.320" style="s2">essentially out of the backside of black</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.340" end="01:10:13.000" style="s2">holes in their previous universe with a</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.320" end="01:10:15.910" style="s2">small jiggling of the laws of physics</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.000" end="01:10:18.010" style="s2">and that there&#39;s this then tree of</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.910" end="01:10:19.480" style="s2">universes and those universes which have</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.010" end="01:10:22.260" style="s2">lots of black holes have lots of</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.480" end="01:10:24.760" style="s2">children and so universes</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.260" end="01:10:26.760" style="s2">and in the artifice I call that book you</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.760" end="01:10:29.640" style="s2">actually suggested there was some</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.760" end="01:10:32.410" style="s2">counterfactuals that might well soon be</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.640" end="01:10:34.180" style="s2">discovered in terms was it curvature of</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.410" end="01:10:36.010" style="s2">the universe I don&#39;t remember but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.180" end="01:10:37.720" style="s2">if you could update us on the status of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.010" end="01:10:39.700" style="s2">that theory I mean whether there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.720" end="01:10:42.790" style="s2">any new information that would rule that</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.700" end="01:10:45.190" style="s2">one in or out so that theory I call</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.790" end="01:10:47.770" style="s2">cosmological natural selection and it</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.190" end="01:10:48.430" style="s2">was the subject of my first book life of</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.770" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">the cosmos</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.430" end="01:10:55.180" style="s2">there isn&#39;t much new unfortunately I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:58.110" style="s2">sorry to say but the important statement</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.180" end="01:11:02.920" style="s2">is that I made based on that theory in</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.110" end="01:11:06.580" style="s2">1992 two predictions one of them is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.920" end="01:11:08.800" style="s2">the heaviest possible neutron star would</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.580" end="01:11:11.680" style="s2">be no heavier than twice the mass of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.800" end="01:11:15.070" style="s2">Sun the so called upper mass limit for</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.680" end="01:11:18.310" style="s2">neutron stars and the other has to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.070" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">with the hypothesis of inflation that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.310" end="01:11:23.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge expansion very early in</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:27.180" style="s2">the universe that gives new universes</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.290" end="01:11:30.430" style="s2">ultimate size and shape and so forth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.180" end="01:11:33.220" style="s2">the prediction from my theory for</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.430" end="01:11:36.160" style="s2">inflation is that only the simplest</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.220" end="01:11:38.530" style="s2">possible model of inflation so-called</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.160" end="01:11:41.410" style="s2">single field single parameter inflation</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.530" end="01:11:44.220" style="s2">could be correct and if there was a</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.410" end="01:11:46.390" style="s2">measurement of the details of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.220" end="01:11:49.630" style="s2">fluctuations in the microwave background</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.390" end="01:11:51.250" style="s2">or in the distribution of galaxies or in</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.630" end="01:11:53.320" style="s2">the other ways that we can measure the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.250" end="01:11:56.560" style="s2">early state of the universe they would</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.320" end="01:11:58.900" style="s2">have to be explained by that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.560" end="01:12:01.870" style="s2">inflation theory with one field in one</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.900" end="01:12:04.180" style="s2">parameter and so far both of those</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.870" end="01:12:07.000" style="s2">predictions hold up although I should</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.180" end="01:12:10.120" style="s2">say that there are a few observations of</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.000" end="01:12:13.450" style="s2">neutron stars that come in with a higher</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.120" end="01:12:17.230" style="s2">mass as the central value they have</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.450" end="01:12:19.090" style="s2">large error bars and in all the cases in</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.230" end="01:12:22.540" style="s2">which michonne star masses are well</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.090" end="01:12:24.820" style="s2">measured there at most one point nine</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.540" end="01:12:26.890" style="s2">seven times the mass of the Sun so they</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.820" end="01:12:30.070" style="s2">come very close to violating the bound</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.890" end="01:12:31.690" style="s2">but don&#39;t yet violated okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.070" end="01:12:33.760" style="s2">interesting so you were the theory is</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.690" end="01:12:35.130" style="s2">still alive hasn&#39;t been clearly</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.760" end="01:12:36.810" style="s2">falsified</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.130" end="01:12:38.489" style="s2">then there&#39;s no new evidence to support</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.810" end="01:12:42.030" style="s2">it either is that a fair way to describe</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.489" end="01:12:46.110" style="s2">it yes way the way that I saw this</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.030" end="01:12:49.199" style="s2">theory is not III didn&#39;t make a big bed</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.110" end="01:12:51.239" style="s2">personally that the theory would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.199" end="01:12:53.580" style="s2">correct that the assumptions that its</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.239" end="01:12:56.580" style="s2">cosmological natural selection makes did</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.580" end="01:12:59.219" style="s2">you summarize would be correct but it</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.580" end="01:13:02.250" style="s2">demonstrated something which I think is</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.219" end="01:13:05.940" style="s2">very important which is that a theory of</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.250" end="01:13:08.429" style="s2">framework in which laws can evolve over</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.940" end="01:13:11.570" style="s2">time and remember I believe the time is</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.429" end="01:13:15.300" style="s2">real and fundamental has greater</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.570" end="01:13:19.139" style="s2">empirical success in the sense of makes</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.300" end="01:13:21.690" style="s2">more falsifiable predictions then the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.139" end="01:13:25.170" style="s2">theory that assumes that the laws are</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.690" end="01:13:26.219" style="s2">eternal and fixed it&#39;s also somehow I</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.170" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I would call it</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.219" end="01:13:34.530" style="s2">encouraging you know that the future is</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:36.929" style="s2">not laplacian yes I feel that way I</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.530" end="01:13:38.820" style="s2">can&#39;t put my finger on it scientifically</p>

<p begin="01:14:31.860" end="01:14:38.460" style="s2">the foundations of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.770" end="01:14:40.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a proposal by Roger Penrose and</p>

<p begin="01:14:40.800" end="01:14:45.650" style="s2">a part of the wave-particle duality the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.870" end="01:14:49.290" style="s2">so-called wavefunction from time to time</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.650" end="01:14:51.690" style="s2">spontaneously collapses now to give you</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.290" end="01:14:54.270" style="s2">some background for this one of the</p>

<p begin="01:14:54.270" end="01:14:57.600" style="s2">quantum mechanics I described that has</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.890" end="01:15:00.330" style="s2">to do with measurement is that if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.600" end="01:15:03.330" style="s2">have a wavefunction which is spread out</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.330" end="01:15:05.880" style="s2">over a large area and you try to observe</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.330" end="01:15:07.739" style="s2">the position of the particle you will</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.880" end="01:15:09.690" style="s2">discover the particle is at some</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.690" end="01:15:16.320" style="s2">wavefunction collapses to begin growth</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.260" end="01:15:19.050" style="s2">again from a concentration at that point</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.320" end="01:15:21.330" style="s2">where the particle was found and that</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.050" end="01:15:23.880" style="s2">collapsed the wavefunction or the</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.330" end="01:15:26.580" style="s2">projection postulate is called by von</p>

<p begin="01:15:32.640" end="01:15:37.830" style="s2">tells us that this happens whenever we</p>

<p begin="01:15:37.830" end="01:15:42.989" style="s2">it very observer dependent and intention</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.950" end="01:15:45.750" style="s2">and knowledge dependent Roger Penrose</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.989" end="01:15:49.110" style="s2">said maybe there&#39;s some real physical</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.750" end="01:15:52.440" style="s2">reason that tells the wavefunction to</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.110" end="01:15:54.750" style="s2">collapse there&#39;s some criteria that</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.440" end="01:15:56.340" style="s2">maybe is expressed in an equation which</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.750" end="01:15:57.180" style="s2">brings about the collapse of the</p>

<p begin="01:15:57.180" end="01:16:03.719" style="s2">and he hypothesized that this had to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.930" end="01:16:06.150" style="s2">with when gravity would be measurable</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.719" end="01:16:07.800" style="s2">that is if you imagine you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.150" end="01:16:10.590" style="s2">something like the Schrodinger card</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.800" end="01:16:13.680" style="s2">where the cat is either alive or dead if</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.590" end="01:16:16.140" style="s2">there became a separation between the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.680" end="01:16:17.700" style="s2">live in the dead cat large enough to</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.140" end="01:16:19.830" style="s2">make a measurable difference in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.700" end="01:16:21.930" style="s2">gravitational field then that would</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.830" end="01:16:24.650" style="s2">trigger this process of wavefunction</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.930" end="01:16:29.100" style="s2">collapse according to Roger Penrose and</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.650" end="01:16:32.670" style="s2">the sensitivity to do that experiment in</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.100" end="01:16:36.020" style="s2">other words to see a new quantum effect</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.670" end="01:16:40.160" style="s2">which is not part of the standard theory</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.020" end="01:16:43.320" style="s2">coming from trying to locate a mass</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.160" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">which is a big enough mass that is could</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.320" end="01:16:49.270" style="s2">affect the geometry of space and time</p>

<p begin="01:16:49.270" end="01:16:54.910" style="s2">testable right now and there are in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.520" end="01:16:56.860" style="s2">last year a number of papers by several</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.910" end="01:17:00.100" style="s2">different research groups I think all in</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.860" end="01:17:02.950" style="s2">Europe describing concrete plans to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.100" end="01:17:04.840" style="s2">such an experiment and that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.950" end="01:17:08.470" style="s2">exciting the other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.840" end="01:17:12.400" style="s2">extremely exciting to me is the growth</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.470" end="01:17:15.910" style="s2">of in the size of the molecule that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.400" end="01:17:18.670" style="s2">can treat as entangled see I&#39;m described</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.910" end="01:17:22.239" style="s2">entanglement as these correlations or</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.670" end="01:17:26.620" style="s2">shared properties but entanglement has</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.239" end="01:17:28.690" style="s2">an enemy which is noise random thermal</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.620" end="01:17:31.210" style="s2">noise is coming from the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.690" end="01:17:33.670" style="s2">everything is randomly in motion because</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.210" end="01:17:35.910" style="s2">everything is at some temperature and in</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.670" end="01:17:39.100" style="s2">order to see the effects of entanglement</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.910" end="01:17:40.810" style="s2">you have to somehow kill the effects of</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.100" end="01:17:44.050" style="s2">the random noise that permeates</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.810" end="01:17:46.570" style="s2">everywhere and people are learning to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.050" end="01:17:49.930" style="s2">this and as they do it the size of the</p>

<p begin="01:17:53.140" end="01:17:59.710" style="s2">properties gives up a little bit and</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.340" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">there are larger and larger systems of</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.710" end="01:18:05.290" style="s2">entangled quantum states that are being</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:07.840" style="s2">produced in the laboratory and this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.290" end="01:18:10.239" style="s2">very exciting because it seems to me in</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.840" end="01:18:12.190" style="s2">the kind of theories that I make if it&#39;s</p>
