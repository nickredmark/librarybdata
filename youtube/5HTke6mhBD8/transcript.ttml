<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">I think my biography will be a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:39.810" style="s2">bit less lengthly</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:43.790" style="s2">lengthy than some of your guests and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">32 years old so I haven&#39;t too much yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.790" end="00:01:49.410" style="s2">and I guess that the two strands of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">life that I can kind of point to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.410" end="00:01:54.330" style="s2">are probably relevant for this</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">conversation are the work I&#39;ve done in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.330" end="00:01:59.910" style="s2">social and systems change movements</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:03.330" style="s2">these of the Occupy Wall Street and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.910" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">cooperative housing you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.330" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">creating various communities taking part</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">in various communities and then the kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:14.240" style="s2">of more spiritual side where I&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:17.160" style="s2">for about now oh my gosh five years in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.240" end="00:02:19.170" style="s2">kind of intensive meditation communities</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.160" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">mostly in the Theravada Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.170" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">tradition and I currently live at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">place called the monastic Academy in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:28.220" style="s2">Lowell Vermont was like very far north</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">in Vermont right at the Canadian border</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.220" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">where it&#39;s kind of like trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:37.770" style="s2">out what is a monastery for the modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">world and which I love that inquiry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.770" end="00:02:42.270" style="s2">really alive for me and then I also</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.900" end="00:02:44.099" style="s2">probably the reason I&#39;m on this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.270" end="00:02:45.990" style="s2">with you now the reason that we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.099" end="00:02:50.090" style="s2">introduced is because I myself have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:52.590" style="s2">podcast called a merge where you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">essentially I started it off as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.590" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">inquiry that was something like you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">the world feels really broken I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">really know what to do about that or how</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.220" end="00:03:04.860" style="s2">to think about that let&#39;s talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:06.900" style="s2">who seem to have some idea and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.860" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">just sort of like follow my nose follow</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:10.380" style="s2">the ear Oh swell</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:11.700" style="s2">the curiosity that was alive you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.380" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">day-to-day week-to-week I would read a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.700" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">book that really captured my my heart my</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:18.810" style="s2">soul you know you know email I&#39;d find</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:20.069" style="s2">the email for the person be like hey you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.810" end="00:03:22.349" style="s2">want to be in a podcast and were some</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.069" end="00:03:23.700" style="s2">reason that&#39;s persuasive to people in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.349" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">today&#39;s world and they would go on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.700" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">podcast and I would get to talk to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">person I admired for an hour and a half</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">and you know those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:33.569" style="s2">apparently have have resonated with</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:36.569" style="s2">people it&#39;s that podcast his audience</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.569" end="00:03:41.010" style="s2">has grown and in the process I have kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.569" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">of come to a sort of understanding or</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.010" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">vision of the state of play of the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:50.700" style="s2">and the phase shift that is coming at us</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">whether we like it or not and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.700" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">that&#39;s those conversations are probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">why we were connected you know speaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:58.380" style="s2">with people like Jem Bendele and Vinay</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:35.400" style="s2">I love certainly that&#39;s what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.940" end="00:04:37.800" style="s2">but also beyond that part of this post</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.400" end="00:04:39.870" style="s2">doom series is it&#39;s not just sounding</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.800" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">the alarm because really as bio come</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.010" end="00:04:56.700" style="s2">needed now because urgency implies that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.020" end="00:04:58.590" style="s2">if we all if there&#39;s enough of us that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.700" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">get together and do this one thing or</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.590" end="00:05:05.880" style="s2">these few things then dot dot dot we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">avoid the cut yeah yeah it&#39;s almost more</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.880" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">like maybe I would say like turning on</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.100" end="00:05:27.300" style="s2">or at least we need to respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.900" end="00:05:28.980" style="s2">and that might mean slowing down that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.300" end="00:05:31.800" style="s2">might be the appropriate response it</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.980" end="00:05:34.440" style="s2">might mean sinking into presence and</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.470" end="00:06:32.460" style="s2">to his workshop in Costa Rica and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.030" end="00:06:36.420" style="s2">was one of the questions right was that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.460" end="00:06:39.390" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like what is passing what</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.420" end="00:06:43.020" style="s2">in particular is passing away I guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.390" end="00:06:45.510" style="s2">not I think the thing that I see with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.020" end="00:06:46.530" style="s2">lot of my peers who I talk to about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.510" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.530" end="00:06:53.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like collapse becomes this almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:55.920" style="s2">like binary zombie apocalypse where as I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.640" end="00:06:57.860" style="s2">collapse and then poof everything is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.920" end="00:07:00.030" style="s2">just gone it&#39;s like this this just</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.860" end="00:07:03.060" style="s2">turning over of everything but actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.030" end="00:07:05.220" style="s2">as you say there&#39;s opportunities in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.060" end="00:07:07.290" style="s2">that I think we&#39;d be wise to take a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.220" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">take your damage in yeah what language</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.290" end="00:07:12.330" style="s2">do you use or have you used what do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:14.190" style="s2">find most helpful in terms of when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.330" end="00:07:16.170" style="s2">speak and when you think for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.190" end="00:07:19.890" style="s2">about these contracting and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.170" end="00:07:24.210" style="s2">deteriorating times yeah I tend now to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.890" end="00:07:28.350" style="s2">use the couple different terms one is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.210" end="00:07:30.600" style="s2">the meta-crisis omaree&#39;s nobody senate</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.350" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">crisis is the kind of collection of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.600" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">crises that we&#39;re now facing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.150" end="00:07:40.620" style="s2">the bundle and dad and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:42.689" style="s2">phase-shift right and that leaves it</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.620" end="00:07:44.849" style="s2">ambiguous whether we&#39;re gonna phase</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.689" end="00:07:48.300" style="s2">shift into a higher order of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.849" end="00:07:50.009" style="s2">or into a lower order of complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.300" end="00:07:52.919" style="s2">that there&#39;s an inevitable phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.009" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that we&#39;re coming upon and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.919" end="00:07:56.729" style="s2">appreciate that because it doesn&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:58.830" style="s2">sort of bias the interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.729" end="00:08:00.839" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s happening it still allows</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.830" end="00:08:03.240" style="s2">us to participate it you know into</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.839" end="00:08:05.399" style="s2">existence yeah yeah yeah I like that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.240" end="00:08:08.999" style="s2">mean I I personally don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.399" end="00:08:11.580" style="s2">there&#39;s any possibility of a larger</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.999" end="00:08:12.659" style="s2">order of complexity only because one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.580" end="00:08:15.389" style="s2">the things I&#39;ve been studying for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.659" end="00:08:16.979" style="s2">last six years is energy and ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.389" end="00:08:19.169" style="s2">there&#39;s always an upper limit to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.979" end="00:08:21.809" style="s2">complexity before you start reading the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.169" end="00:08:23.819" style="s2">energetic limits but nonetheless I like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.809" end="00:08:26.610" style="s2">that these sort of subtle ambiguity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.819" end="00:08:29.129" style="s2">phase shift that&#39;s so that the your</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.610" end="00:08:30.919" style="s2">reading of energy systems suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.129" end="00:08:33.510" style="s2">we could not achieve a higher order</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.919" end="00:08:37.529" style="s2">complexity civilization correct yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.510" end="00:08:40.979" style="s2">because we&#39;re already into we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.529" end="00:08:43.589" style="s2">more than a decade into the dirtier</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.979" end="00:08:48.360" style="s2">harder to get much more expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.589" end="00:08:51.240" style="s2">much more polluting aspects of dense</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.360" end="00:08:52.709" style="s2">concentrated energy and there&#39;s no other</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.240" end="00:08:54.839" style="s2">place in the solar system</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.709" end="00:08:56.699" style="s2">you know people talking about mining</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.839" end="00:08:59.579" style="s2">other you know asteroids and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.699" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">that there&#39;s no we there&#39;s oh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.579" end="00:09:03.690" style="s2">limit of every planet has a limited</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:06.089" style="s2">amount of dense concentrated energy that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.690" end="00:09:07.649" style="s2">could be used and we&#39;ve we&#39;re now into</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.089" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">the much more difficult harder to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.649" end="00:09:12.779" style="s2">stuff and it turns out that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:15.690" style="s2">energy per capita one of the whites law</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.779" end="00:09:19.829" style="s2">in biology talks about that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.690" end="00:09:23.220" style="s2">complexity of any system is integrally</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.829" end="00:09:25.470" style="s2">tied to its energy use per capita yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.220" end="00:09:27.690" style="s2">so we&#39;re now in a decreasing energy per</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.470" end="00:09:29.910" style="s2">capita and so there will be a decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.690" end="00:09:32.730" style="s2">energy and it&#39;s it&#39;s as solid as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.910" end="00:09:34.639" style="s2">second law of thermodynamics where do</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.730" end="00:09:37.319" style="s2">you where can I read more about that uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.639" end="00:09:39.209" style="s2">there was a guy Sid Smith Connie</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.319" end="00:09:41.430" style="s2">literally just three four five days ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.209" end="00:09:44.499" style="s2">just within the last week we watched a</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.499" end="00:09:49.809" style="s2">did an hour-long presentation I will</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.809" end="00:09:56.889" style="s2">in the in the description box of this as</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.909" end="00:10:02.439" style="s2">well but that&#39;s fabulous also Nate</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.889" end="00:10:05.469" style="s2">Hagen&#39;s Nate has a reality 101 course he</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.439" end="00:10:07.619" style="s2">teaches students freshmen you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.469" end="00:10:10.479" style="s2">an honors level course honor student</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.619" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">course at University of Michigan I mean</p>

<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:19.299" style="s2">covers energy just deeply its energy it</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.649" end="00:10:20.859" style="s2">turns out that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.299" end="00:10:23.429" style="s2">none of us have learned in our families</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.859" end="00:10:27.039" style="s2">our churches our synagogues our you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.429" end="00:10:29.439" style="s2">spiritual communities nor anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.039" end="00:10:32.559" style="s2">about energy and how ecosystems how</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.439" end="00:10:36.129" style="s2">ecology works and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.559" end="00:10:38.709" style="s2">piece the most significant authors in</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.129" end="00:10:41.259" style="s2">that field without a doubt would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.709" end="00:10:43.059" style="s2">William cotton and his book overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.259" end="00:10:46.089" style="s2">the ecological basis of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.059" end="00:10:48.399" style="s2">change and and so is your sense after</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.089" end="00:10:49.749" style="s2">learning all of this and I mean I feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.399" end="00:10:51.459" style="s2">like I almost want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.749" end="00:10:54.779" style="s2">can I ask you questions is that what</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.459" end="00:10:59.799" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely is that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.779" end="00:11:03.429" style="s2">shred in you that senses that we might</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.799" end="00:11:07.379" style="s2">sort of thread the eye of the needle</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.429" end="00:11:09.249" style="s2">here and graduate into a more elegant</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.379" end="00:11:13.209" style="s2">civilizational design that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.249" end="00:11:15.909" style="s2">more beautiful sustainable and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.209" end="00:11:18.129" style="s2">fully planetary no there&#39;s no shred in</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.909" end="00:11:20.819" style="s2">me there&#39;s not one on a scale of zero to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.129" end="00:11:24.279" style="s2">a hundred on a zero on the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.819" end="00:11:26.499" style="s2">and that comes from literally spending</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.279" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">30 to 40 hours sometimes 50 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.499" end="00:11:31.119" style="s2">over the course the last seven years</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">studying ecology and energy at the rise</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.119" end="00:11:35.350" style="s2">and fall of civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:37.779" style="s2">how was it for you growing up and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.350" end="00:11:42.060" style="s2">how did you make whatever shifts you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.779" end="00:11:42.060" style="s2">made to the worldview that you now hold</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.120" end="00:11:47.709" style="s2">yeah so I definitely was raised I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.160" end="00:11:49.930" style="s2">even through osmosis with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.709" end="00:11:54.970" style="s2">sense of infinite growth infinite</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.930" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">progress and as soon as I graduated</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.970" end="00:12:01.660" style="s2">college and started to live in a city I</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:12:03.129" style="s2">lived in Washington DC I had I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.660" end="00:12:05.800" style="s2">recently started meditating and I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.129" end="00:12:08.740" style="s2">sensitive enough that I think I could</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.800" end="00:12:12.879" style="s2">just like feel in my body that something</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.740" end="00:12:14.439" style="s2">was off about like cities and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.879" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">articulate it like intellectually I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.439" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a theory of why that was but</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:26.350" style="s2">there was like something inhuman about</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">it or unnatural and and I left the city</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.350" end="00:12:31.569" style="s2">and I went and lived in a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:34.360" style="s2">center and eventually encountered the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.569" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">work of somebody who&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.360" end="00:12:38.110" style="s2">peak oil and so I got really into peak</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:40.059" style="s2">oil for a while and then that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.110" end="00:12:42.069" style="s2">work out like Peak Oil apparently didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.059" end="00:12:44.259" style="s2">happen and so for a while I had like</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.069" end="00:12:46.360" style="s2">five years where I was like maybe I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.259" end="00:12:49.149" style="s2">wrong like maybe we can keep going</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.360" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s all chill I can get a job at</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.149" end="00:12:54.339" style="s2">a software company and you know I did I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:58.990" style="s2">kind of like played the Millennial dream</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.339" end="00:13:00.459" style="s2">of a decent job at a and making enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.990" end="00:13:04.660" style="s2">money and living in a nice place I lived</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.459" end="00:13:05.889" style="s2">in Boulder Colorado and I did that for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.660" end="00:13:09.819" style="s2">while but then through the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.889" end="00:13:13.870" style="s2">I had my podcast I became it became</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.819" end="00:13:17.589" style="s2">clear to me that that was an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.870" end="00:13:19.420" style="s2">that the way that I was attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.589" end="00:13:23.079" style="s2">live was basically putting my head in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:25.089" style="s2">the sand and it was ignoring the reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.079" end="00:13:29.559" style="s2">of what time it is on the planet and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.089" end="00:13:32.589" style="s2">in order to be right with myself I had</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.559" end="00:13:33.910" style="s2">to move back to the monastery and really</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.589" end="00:13:36.230" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.910" end="00:13:39.399" style="s2">you know and whatever way I could live</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.230" end="00:13:43.879" style="s2">in accordance with that understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.399" end="00:13:51.230" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing to the planet and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.879" end="00:13:53.179" style="s2">is real I suppose and yeah and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.230" end="00:13:56.389" style="s2">kind of where I find myself now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.179" end="00:13:58.369" style="s2">still maybe I haven&#39;t read to overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.389" end="00:14:00.100" style="s2">so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.369" end="00:14:02.269" style="s2">certainty you have and I haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.100" end="00:14:03.949" style="s2">the research you know I&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.269" end="00:14:07.609" style="s2">people in podcasts and I have an</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.949" end="00:14:10.759" style="s2">intuitive sense of like yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.609" end="00:14:12.559" style="s2">impossibility of the way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.759" end="00:14:17.149" style="s2">doing things the civilization that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.559" end="00:14:22.459" style="s2">have now but I also do retain some kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.149" end="00:14:27.100" style="s2">of like hope or that&#39;s not even hope is</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.459" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">the right word it&#39;s like trust or</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.100" end="00:14:34.790" style="s2">willingness to be surprised by humans</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:36.410" style="s2">and by nature like that there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.790" end="00:14:38.299" style="s2">of I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.410" end="00:14:40.790" style="s2">more than there is a sense of doom</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.299" end="00:14:42.949" style="s2">anymore I had a sense of doom for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.790" end="00:14:44.449" style="s2">while I actually moved back to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.949" end="00:14:48.069" style="s2">monastery being kind of carried by that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.449" end="00:14:53.389" style="s2">sense of doom but now when I check in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.069" end="00:14:55.879" style="s2">there&#39;s wonder and there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.389" end="00:14:58.459" style="s2">like whoa what is going to happen like</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.879" end="00:15:01.220" style="s2">stuff is getting crazy what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.459" end="00:15:07.399" style="s2">happen and there&#39;s interest and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.220" end="00:15:12.410" style="s2">amazement and curiosity but not know</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.399" end="00:15:14.209" style="s2">certainty here yeah well I&#39;m a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.410" end="00:15:20.649" style="s2">percent with you in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.209" end="00:15:26.600" style="s2">cultivation and the grounding oneself in</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.600" end="00:15:34.730" style="s2">awestruck wonder interest curiosity I</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.539" end="00:15:35.960" style="s2">love those and that&#39;s where I stay most</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.730" end="00:15:37.730" style="s2">of the time</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.960" end="00:15:42.890" style="s2">you mentioned peak oil one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.730" end="00:15:47.930" style="s2">greatest marketing successes in recent</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.890" end="00:15:51.320" style="s2">decades is the very successful campaign</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.930" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">to discredit peak oil even though it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.320" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">isn&#39;t and didn&#39;t get discredited I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:57.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s actually as real as ever</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.980" end="00:16:00.770" style="s2">we&#39;re over ten you were 11 years or 12</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.290" end="00:16:03.250" style="s2">years depending on I counted into peak</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.770" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">oil into peak conventional petroleum</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.250" end="00:16:08.090" style="s2">sure I mean when I say that I was more</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:10.270" style="s2">referring to the fact that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.090" end="00:16:12.680" style="s2">the book that I read suggested that like</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.270" end="00:16:14.360" style="s2">2012-2013 everything would just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.680" end="00:16:16.040" style="s2">start to follow although I exactly know</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.360" end="00:16:19.610" style="s2">there were many people who were speaking</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.040" end="00:16:21.230" style="s2">from a peak oil perspective and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.610" end="00:16:22.370" style="s2">more than that I never following Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.230" end="00:16:25.070" style="s2">Pinchbeck I don&#39;t you&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.370" end="00:16:28.280" style="s2">his work yes return of Quetzalcoatl and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.070" end="00:16:30.740" style="s2">the whole 2012 mythology like I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.280" end="00:16:32.660" style="s2">do there is there was a feeling in me</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.740" end="00:16:35.000" style="s2">and I actually see this in a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.660" end="00:16:38.780" style="s2">peers like millennial peers of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.000" end="00:16:43.610" style="s2">like fool me once you know with regards</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.780" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">to eschatology like okay maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.610" end="00:16:47.810" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:51.170" style="s2">suspicion of takes on it like especially</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.810" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">certainty right absolutely you know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.170" end="00:16:55.070" style="s2">do you know like these things are so big</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.970" end="00:16:58.460" style="s2">they&#39;re so complex like we&#39;ll figure out</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.070" end="00:17:00.440" style="s2">a way through it and yeah for better for</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.460" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">worse that&#39;s kind of like when I talk to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.440" end="00:17:05.570" style="s2">people in my age or they&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:07.940" style="s2">well maybe yeah and that skepticism is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.570" end="00:17:10.760" style="s2">well-earned and his advisor</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.940" end="00:17:12.740" style="s2">I mean I I one of the again I come back</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.760" end="00:17:14.810" style="s2">to my favorite authors people like John</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.740" end="00:17:18.770" style="s2">Michael Greer whoever had 15 or 14 of</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.810" end="00:17:19.880" style="s2">his books and he is relentless on if I</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.770" end="00:17:24.320" style="s2">keep wrote a whole book called</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.880" end="00:17:26.540" style="s2">apocalypse not everything you know about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.320" end="00:17:29.270" style="s2">Nostradamus 2012 and the rapture is</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.540" end="00:17:32.300" style="s2">wrong and he takes a look at the history</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.270" end="00:17:35.480" style="s2">of apocalyptic thinking from when it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.300" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">first introduced 3200 years ago in</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.480" end="00:17:39.410" style="s2">Persia and a takes a look at all these</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.580" end="00:17:42.650" style="s2">different cultures and believing the end</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.410" end="00:17:46.010" style="s2">of times and so yeah I mean the only to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.650" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">my mind the only meme or the only set of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.010" end="00:17:53.789" style="s2">projections that&#39;s been more inaccurate</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:57.159" style="s2">then anticipated into the world doom is</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.789" end="00:18:00.039" style="s2">anticipated and projections and claims</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.159" end="00:18:02.200" style="s2">of techno utopia that would probably be</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.039" end="00:18:05.830" style="s2">the only thing that would be more in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.200" end="00:18:07.299" style="s2">error or more examples of well that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.830" end="00:18:12.909" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen you know I&#39;m still waiting</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.299" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2">for my jet but but I&#39;d anybody watching</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.909" end="00:18:18.399" style="s2">or listening to this I recommend William</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:21.399" style="s2">I mean I recommend Richard Heinberg book</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.399" end="00:18:25.059" style="s2">after burn society beyond fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.399" end="00:18:26.830" style="s2">because Richard really is the elder or</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.059" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">certainly one of the great elder in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.830" end="00:18:31.389" style="s2">field understanding energy and and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:32.409" style="s2">also counts captain&#39;s overshoot is one</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.389" end="00:18:35.649" style="s2">of the most important books he&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.409" end="00:18:37.779" style="s2">that young quest destinies but his</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.649" end="00:18:39.970" style="s2">little book which I also recorded the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.779" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">audio it&#39;s available free up on up on</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.970" end="00:18:43.779" style="s2">Soundcloud</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:48.309" style="s2">but after burn society beyond fossil</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.779" end="00:18:51.130" style="s2">fuels really he even talks about he says</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.309" end="00:18:53.830" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look at how well I did back</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.130" end="00:18:55.690" style="s2">in 2004 with my first book on Peak Oil</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.830" end="00:18:57.070" style="s2">the party&#39;s over and he takes a look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.690" end="00:18:59.590" style="s2">the major claims there and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.070" end="00:19:02.260" style="s2">reassesses them and so it&#39;s so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.590" end="00:19:05.019" style="s2">here I mean you&#39;re far more into this</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.260" end="00:19:07.299" style="s2">world than I am you know I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.019" end="00:19:10.299" style="s2">responding to it I think intuitively and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.299" end="00:19:12.370" style="s2">with my own just sort of like how I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.299" end="00:19:14.230" style="s2">made a major life decision right to move</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.370" end="00:19:15.850" style="s2">back to the monastery but like what are</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.230" end="00:19:18.039" style="s2">you I mean if you&#39;re happy that you said</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.850" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve had 40 conversations in this area</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.039" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">so far like what are you seeing as</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:27.130" style="s2">realistically plausible like near-term</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:28.600" style="s2">futures like or I guess the question</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.130" end="00:19:30.399" style="s2">that I used to ask to people on my</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.600" end="00:19:32.789" style="s2">podcast I&#39;d be curious to know what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.399" end="00:19:36.580" style="s2">think it&#39;s like if you were talking to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.789" end="00:19:39.309" style="s2">you know some person around my age or</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.580" end="00:19:43.480" style="s2">younger like how would you suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.309" end="00:19:46.090" style="s2">they think about their future given what</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.480" end="00:19:48.970" style="s2">you know yeah well given the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.090" end="00:19:51.100" style="s2">my children are your age I&#39;ve got a 36</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.970" end="00:19:53.260" style="s2">year old daughter a 34 year old son and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.100" end="00:19:54.610" style="s2">a 29 year old daughter who just informed</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.260" end="00:19:57.399" style="s2">me a month ago that she&#39;s pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.610" end="00:19:59.590" style="s2">and and I also have an 8 year old</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.399" end="00:20:02.470" style="s2">granddaughter so this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.590" end="00:20:04.419" style="s2">question but this particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.470" end="00:20:06.700" style="s2">caste is mostly me asking you questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.419" end="00:20:09.549" style="s2">so I feel happy to be interviewed in</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.700" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">your podcast well I will say this that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.549" end="00:20:16.210" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of very close to Jim bundle</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:20.860" style="s2">collapse of complex dissipative</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.210" end="00:20:23.559" style="s2">structures is it absolutely guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.860" end="00:20:27.299" style="s2">it&#39;s a hundred percent inevitable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.559" end="00:20:30.580" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult because certainty is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.299" end="00:20:32.409" style="s2">relationally toxic and so I hesitate to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.580" end="00:20:34.330" style="s2">say that with that kind of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.409" end="00:20:35.950" style="s2">because that sort of stops the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.330" end="00:20:40.419" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s sort of arrogant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.950" end="00:20:42.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just numerous and so and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.419" end="00:20:44.530" style="s2">not you know if somebody were to have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.130" end="00:20:45.700" style="s2">conversation with me and say well no the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.530" end="00:20:48.039" style="s2">earth doesn&#39;t go around the Sun the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.700" end="00:20:49.809" style="s2">goes around the earth you know you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.039" end="00:20:51.669" style="s2">to have some epistemic humility around</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.809" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">that and well no actually there are</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:56.860" style="s2">in reality interchangeably there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.210" end="00:20:58.780" style="s2">certain things in reality to speak</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.860" end="00:21:00.190" style="s2">mythically God has revealed to us</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.780" end="00:21:01.240" style="s2">through evidence that are totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.190" end="00:21:04.210" style="s2">compelling and it would be false</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.809" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">limit is determined by energy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.320" end="00:21:21.640" style="s2">ecological factors other ecological sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:23.230" style="s2">of limits such as Lighting&#39;s law the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.640" end="00:21:24.730" style="s2">minimum that you know I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.230" end="00:21:28.900" style="s2">get into that but they answer your</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.730" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">question I see collapse not as something</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.900" end="00:21:33.640" style="s2">that could happen might happen won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:35.380" style="s2">happen collapses 30 years already</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.640" end="00:21:37.390" style="s2">ongoing I mean both the most in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.380" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">life I mean basically since depending</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.390" end="00:21:42.700" style="s2">upon where you started but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:44.500" style="s2">certainly the mid 70s to mid 80s and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.700" end="00:21:47.380" style="s2">really in some systems collapse since</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.500" end="00:21:49.720" style="s2">the 1950s of the ecosystem so if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.380" end="00:21:52.630" style="s2">look at the water the fisheries the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.720" end="00:21:54.280" style="s2">other species the insects if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.630" end="00:21:56.890" style="s2">carbon in the atmosphere yeah I mean all</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.280" end="00:22:00.580" style="s2">of these earth centered life yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.890" end="00:22:01.210" style="s2">measures yeah yeah that&#39;s very clear to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.580" end="00:22:03.190" style="s2">me too</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.210" end="00:22:06.010" style="s2">I think that that we are already in to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.190" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">collapse and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a stair-step</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.010" end="00:22:10.929" style="s2">and there&#39;s partial recovery so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:13.330" style="s2">the way that virtually all civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.929" end="00:22:15.640" style="s2">city-based civilizations and a city is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.330" end="00:22:19.270" style="s2">almost by definition a human</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.640" end="00:22:21.970" style="s2">ecosystem that has overshot the carrying</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.270" end="00:22:24.910" style="s2">capacity of its region so it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.970" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">draw on resources from outside to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.910" end="00:22:32.140" style="s2">sustain and so that collapse is already</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:34.180" style="s2">ongoing and there will be you know some</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.140" end="00:22:35.650" style="s2">larger downturns and then some shorter</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.180" end="00:22:37.630" style="s2">ones and there&#39;ll be partial recoveries</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.650" end="00:22:39.040" style="s2">that&#39;s why John Michael Greer&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.630" end="00:22:41.290" style="s2">of catabolic collapse is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.040" end="00:22:43.930" style="s2">elegant he talks about anabolic collapse</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.290" end="00:22:46.330" style="s2">which is IDs overextend what they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.930" end="00:22:48.220" style="s2">afford to maintain and they start</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.330" end="00:22:50.050" style="s2">feeding on themselves I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.220" end="00:22:53.230" style="s2">the Rust Belt is in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.050" end="00:22:56.170" style="s2">the Rust Belt is it since 1970 the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.230" end="00:22:58.630" style="s2">United States has been post peak oil and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.170" end="00:23:00.670" style="s2">we are now catabolic we are eating</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.630" end="00:23:02.130" style="s2">ourselves to death and that&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.670" end="00:23:05.050" style="s2">civilizations that&#39;s what city based</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.130" end="00:23:07.330" style="s2">unsustainable civilizations do so for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.050" end="00:23:09.010" style="s2">that is knowing that my children and</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.330" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2">grandchildren are gonna have as long as</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.010" end="00:23:13.210" style="s2">they live that&#39;s gonna be their reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:16.860" style="s2">the reality is dominated by less and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.210" end="00:23:19.450" style="s2">less not more and more yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.860" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to be challenging really</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.450" end="00:23:23.680" style="s2">challenging but also what a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:25.150" style="s2">people by focusing on that don&#39;t see is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.680" end="00:23:28.900" style="s2">that in previous collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.150" end="00:23:31.180" style="s2">civilizations you do often see 2025 % of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.900" end="00:23:33.400" style="s2">the worst of humanity show up but you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.180" end="00:23:35.890" style="s2">also see 75 to 80% of the best of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.400" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">humanity show up people are sacrificial</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.890" end="00:23:40.090" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re engaged in each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">lives because we&#39;re all in it together</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.090" end="00:23:44.440" style="s2">and you and your neighbors or your you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">know the people in your community are in</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.440" end="00:23:50.770" style="s2">it together most people respond in very</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:54.010" style="s2">generous compassionate ways and local</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.770" end="00:23:56.050" style="s2">source of meaning and so for example you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.010" end="00:23:59.050" style="s2">know I&#39;m sure you know this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.050" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">your generation an entire generation of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.050" end="00:24:05.560" style="s2">sort of 15 to 35 year old young men not</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:08.050" style="s2">just in the United States but throughout</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.560" end="00:24:09.820" style="s2">the world the industrial world are</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.050" end="00:24:12.430" style="s2">profoundly addicted to internet gaming</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.820" end="00:24:14.050" style="s2">or internet porn or both well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.430" end="00:24:16.270" style="s2">gonna happen when their communities need</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.050" end="00:24:17.590" style="s2">them they&#39;re gonna be engaged because</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.270" end="00:24:20.620" style="s2">their communities need them not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.590" end="00:24:23.020" style="s2">wasting time in front of a screen so so</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.620" end="00:24:26.200" style="s2">I tend to focus on that that young</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.020" end="00:24:27.580" style="s2">people children one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.200" end="00:24:29.480" style="s2">know about previous collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.580" end="00:24:34.580" style="s2">civilizations is that that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.480" end="00:24:40.070" style="s2">saints sages heroes and Shiro&#39;s hmm ORN</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.580" end="00:24:43.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like the womb for them who often</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.070" end="00:24:45.830" style="s2">are then mythologized in you know a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.130" end="00:24:48.140" style="s2">hundred two hundred years later because</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.830" end="00:24:50.390" style="s2">they were so exemplary in their</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.140" end="00:24:53.630" style="s2">leadership and in their self-sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.390" end="00:24:56.690" style="s2">and in their love and compassion in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.630" end="00:24:59.059" style="s2">process so I I think that collapse is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.690" end="00:25:01.460" style="s2">already ongoing that it&#39;s likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.059" end="00:25:04.730" style="s2">really really challenging and anybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.460" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">who thinks that our species couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.730" end="00:25:09.830" style="s2">possibly go extinct in the next 50 to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:11.390" style="s2">100 years isn&#39;t paying attention we may</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.830" end="00:25:12.830" style="s2">last I actually think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.390" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">decent chance that there will be pockets</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.830" end="00:25:16.669" style="s2">of humanity throughout the world that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:17.990" style="s2">lasts but you know for another million</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.669" end="00:25:19.910" style="s2">or two million years before some</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.990" end="00:25:22.250" style="s2">asteroid or supervolcano or something</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.910" end="00:25:23.179" style="s2">takes us out because no mammal our size</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.250" end="00:25:25.400" style="s2">lasts forever</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.179" end="00:25:28.280" style="s2">I mean most mammals our size last at</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.400" end="00:25:30.650" style="s2">most 3 or 4 million years yeah so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.280" end="00:25:33.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s sort of the approach and and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.650" end="00:25:37.160" style="s2">invite people to really especially young</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.470" end="00:25:39.530" style="s2">people to really get their hearts as</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.160" end="00:25:41.630" style="s2">well as their heads around certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.530" end="00:25:44.840" style="s2">things that are inevitable and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.630" end="00:25:47.090" style="s2">invest so that&#39;s why I have a whole</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.090" end="00:25:51.020" style="s2">otherwise what I talk about thus saith</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.919" end="00:25:53.380" style="s2">reality let&#39;s say if you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.020" end="00:25:56.179" style="s2">reality telling us is inevitable is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.380" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">futile because you want to accept what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.179" end="00:25:59.390" style="s2">inevitable hmm you want to not invest in</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">what&#39;s futile</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.390" end="00:26:03.950" style="s2">let&#39;s genuinely futile and then you want</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:05.570" style="s2">to be able to discern what&#39;s Pro future</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.950" end="00:26:07.460" style="s2">and soul nourishing and then invest</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.570" end="00:26:09.530" style="s2">everything you got in what&#39;s Pro future</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.460" end="00:26:13.179" style="s2">and soul nourishing because that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.530" end="00:26:15.950" style="s2">to give you the most meaningful joyous a</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.500" end="00:27:28.820" style="s2">like calls me forth into a more</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.930" end="00:27:31.420" style="s2">beautiful more meaningful life and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.820" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of how I have found a way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.420" end="00:27:39.820" style="s2">meet collapse and my own existence right</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:43.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually revivified a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.820" end="00:27:45.350" style="s2">day to day in a way that is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.670" end="00:27:47.870" style="s2">and I don&#39;t and it&#39;s funny like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.350" end="00:27:49.730" style="s2">I was actually I just shifted the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.870" end="00:27:51.350" style="s2">inquiry of my podcast because I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.730" end="00:27:54.290" style="s2">of tired of talking about collapse</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.350" end="00:27:57.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like I kind of I get it</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.290" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">like you and like I also love like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.650" end="00:28:02.270" style="s2">know like this new piece around like</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:04.460" style="s2">energy and ecology and overshoot like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.270" end="00:28:06.620" style="s2">want I want to learn that but in general</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.460" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">like I&#39;m more wanting to know like how</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.620" end="00:28:10.790" style="s2">can I be more present with the people in</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:13.910" style="s2">my life yes like what does it really</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.790" end="00:28:17.170" style="s2">mean to be here and be human with each</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.910" end="00:28:20.510" style="s2">other and it&#39;s like that seems really</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.170" end="00:28:23.150" style="s2">amazing and hard and worth doing and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.510" end="00:28:25.490" style="s2">know that in whatever world comes my way</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.150" end="00:28:29.150" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be grateful if I had spent my</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.490" end="00:28:31.490" style="s2">time doing that and that&#39;s seen that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.150" end="00:28:34.090" style="s2">like you and then I can and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.490" end="00:28:38.180" style="s2">it for me I noticed a sense of just like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.090" end="00:28:40.820" style="s2">like releasing of all of that I hope</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.180" end="00:28:42.920" style="s2">that complexity right that it&#39;s so easy</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.820" end="00:28:45.800" style="s2">for me to get invested into it just</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.920" end="00:28:48.500" style="s2">floats away and then like here in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.800" end="00:28:52.460" style="s2">middle of rural Vermont with 15 other</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.500" end="00:28:54.200" style="s2">humans trying to be happy without like</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.460" end="00:28:56.899" style="s2">living together and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.619" end="00:29:12.529" style="s2">G sort of just the universe reality life</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.100" end="00:29:16.009" style="s2">you know they sing Connie and I have had</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.529" end="00:29:18.169" style="s2">this really weird lifestyle for 18 years</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.009" end="00:29:20.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve traveled North America we live in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.169" end="00:29:21.739" style="s2">other people&#39;s homes usually somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.119" end="00:29:23.029" style="s2">second home or vacation home were there</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.739" end="00:29:25.249" style="s2">for a month or two or three at a time</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.029" end="00:29:27.049" style="s2">and then we speak in churches and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.249" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">colleges and universities around that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.049" end="00:29:30.649" style="s2">and meditation centers and others you</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:32.419" style="s2">know within a two-hour radius of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.649" end="00:29:34.279" style="s2">wherever we happen to be living so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.419" end="00:29:37.629" style="s2">speaking to you for example right now in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.279" end="00:29:40.730" style="s2">Vicki Robins house in Langley Washington</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.629" end="00:29:47.359" style="s2">on Whidbey Island because amazing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.730" end="00:29:51.259" style="s2">we&#39;re taking care of Vicki&#39;s cat and but</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.359" end="00:29:54.470" style="s2">but but but by having wealthy people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.259" end="00:29:58.519" style="s2">have surplus housing mmm that have</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.470" end="00:30:01.429" style="s2">offered us to stay for weeks or</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.519" end="00:30:06.769" style="s2">sometimes a few months at a time at no</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.429" end="00:30:09.379" style="s2">cost that has allowed us to become</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.769" end="00:30:12.499" style="s2">independent scholars I mean I spent 20</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.379" end="00:30:15.499" style="s2">30 sometimes 40 or 50 but recently only</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.499" end="00:30:18.619" style="s2">15 to 20 hours a week in study of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.499" end="00:30:22.639" style="s2">complexity and ecology and energy and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.619" end="00:30:24.889" style="s2">collapse and whatever and and I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.639" end="00:30:28.039" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t be able to do that if it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.889" end="00:30:30.169" style="s2">weren&#39;t for the generosity of others who</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.039" end="00:30:31.940" style="s2">are supporting what Connie and I are</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.169" end="00:30:33.590" style="s2">doing in this whole epoch of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.940" end="00:30:35.899" style="s2">sort of what we speak about because</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.590" end="00:30:38.590" style="s2">Connie is a science writer and and her</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.899" end="00:30:41.480" style="s2">passion is assisting trees and migrating</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.590" end="00:30:43.759" style="s2">trees and migrating north faster than</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.480" end="00:30:46.549" style="s2">any other animal can possibly move its</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.759" end="00:30:48.950" style="s2">seeds and so turns out that hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.549" end="00:30:51.590" style="s2">species of plants and trees will go</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.950" end="00:30:53.869" style="s2">extinct absolutely unless humans assist</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.590" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">them in migrating work or migrating</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.869" end="00:30:57.559" style="s2">south of you in the southern hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:59.059" style="s2">but migrating poleward so it&#39;s holy work</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.559" end="00:31:01.549" style="s2">building topsoil and planting trees</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.059" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">especially trees where you get the seeds</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.549" end="00:31:05.509" style="s2">a little bit further south and you plant</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:07.100" style="s2">them at further north this is holy holy</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.509" end="00:31:08.990" style="s2">work yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.100" end="00:31:11.179" style="s2">so what we speak about is where science</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.990" end="00:31:13.130" style="s2">inspiration and sustainability intersect</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.179" end="00:31:14.750" style="s2">but it&#39;s really only been the last seven</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.130" end="00:31:16.850" style="s2">years that we&#39;ve been in to collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.750" end="00:31:19.789" style="s2">the sort of thing and by the grace of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.850" end="00:31:21.860" style="s2">life we&#39;ve been given the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.789" end="00:31:23.630" style="s2">really massively study this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.860" end="00:31:25.280" style="s2">interact with a lot of other people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.630" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">then many of the people who I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.280" end="00:31:29.450" style="s2">interacted with and read are part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">this post doom conversation series yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.450" end="00:31:33.559" style="s2">well it&#39;s fascinating it one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:36.919" style="s2">comes to mind too is you know I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.559" end="00:31:40.250" style="s2">research for an a podcast episode on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.919" end="00:31:43.250" style="s2">topic of like Gen Z politics that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.250" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">the generation after Millennials mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.250" end="00:31:48.110" style="s2">you know people they&#39;re in college right</p>

<p begin="00:31:48.110" end="00:31:54.590" style="s2">to this one researcher their politics</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.409" end="00:31:57.380" style="s2">began with the assumption of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.590" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">collapse of society yes right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.380" end="00:32:01.549" style="s2">how do they respond to it there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:04.370" style="s2">right-leaning response that&#39;s more kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.549" end="00:32:05.690" style="s2">of about acceleration ISM and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.370" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">know and then there&#39;s the more leftist</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.690" end="00:32:09.289" style="s2">response with so there&#39;s a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:12.049" style="s2">a narco primitivism but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.289" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">there&#39;s the the younger generation</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.049" end="00:32:17.690" style="s2">without any kind of as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:20.510" style="s2">very sophisticated like understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.690" end="00:32:23.809" style="s2">energy systems or ecology or complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.510" end="00:32:27.590" style="s2">just knows in their bones that this is</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.890" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">but we also do a practice called</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.090" end="00:34:07.170" style="s2">circling which is like interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:09.960" style="s2">meditation relational meditation we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.170" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">some trauma work together and all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.960" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">this is held in the context of like the</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.530" end="00:34:25.350" style="s2">quite different than most people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.669" end="00:34:27.240" style="s2">vision of a modest area someplace that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.350" end="00:34:29.310" style="s2">just like so they&#39;re totally you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.240" end="00:34:31.710" style="s2">simple like you&#39;re just making bread all</p>

<p begin="00:34:33.150" end="00:34:37.590" style="s2">with a lot of complexity here we may we</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.429" end="00:34:39.210" style="s2">used to make software that taught</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.210" end="00:34:43.590" style="s2">instance so a little bit more like</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.679" end="00:34:47.010" style="s2">modern than most monasteries end up</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.590" end="00:34:49.590" style="s2">being we&#39;re also not actually Buddhist</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.700" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">all the definitions are very particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.210" end="00:35:13.740" style="s2">you know things like that and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:16.230" style="s2">that that&#39;s you know what life is like</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.330" end="00:35:21.330" style="s2">you did that because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:24.870" style="s2">again that I&#39;ve appreciated about</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.330" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">reading histories of the rise and fall</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.870" end="00:35:28.950" style="s2">of civilization Arnold Toynbee</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:31.770" style="s2">Oswald Spengler</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.950" end="00:35:33.510" style="s2">couple T of T stood eco and most of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.770" end="00:35:35.070" style="s2">was I was introduced to through John</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.510" end="00:35:38.430" style="s2">Michael Greer and he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.070" end="00:35:41.370" style="s2">monastic form being perhaps the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.430" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">resilient and a stable form in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.370" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">contracting civilizations in societies</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:49.470" style="s2">and through dark ages that&#39;s right well</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:51.450" style="s2">so and so the other piece to bring in is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.470" end="00:35:53.430" style="s2">that the full name for the this</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.450" end="00:35:55.500" style="s2">monastery is called maple which stands</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.430" end="00:35:58.050" style="s2">for the monastic Academy for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.500" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">preservation of life on Earth and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.050" end="00:36:03.930" style="s2">whole idea of the the founder whose name</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:05.400" style="s2">is sore you for all and he&#39;s just coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.930" end="00:36:07.560" style="s2">out of a two-month solitary retreat</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.400" end="00:36:10.140" style="s2">tomorrow actually so we&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.560" end="00:36:12.620" style="s2">preparing to welcome him back into</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.140" end="00:36:15.180" style="s2">community life the whole idea of it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.620" end="00:36:18.510" style="s2">that he acknowledged from a very young</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.180" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">age that basically we were destroying</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.510" end="00:36:24.990" style="s2">the planet destroying the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:28.020" style="s2">for life to continue as it is and he saw</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.990" end="00:36:30.360" style="s2">exactly as you say that monasteries were</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.020" end="00:36:32.190" style="s2">the most resilient form of human</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.360" end="00:36:34.650" style="s2">organization he said he will always say</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.190" end="00:36:37.410" style="s2">like you know civilizations rise and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.650" end="00:36:40.440" style="s2">fall while these monasteries just</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.410" end="00:36:42.690" style="s2">continue on Amen it&#39;s amazing no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.440" end="00:36:45.900" style="s2">incredible and so perhaps we can create</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.690" end="00:36:48.020" style="s2">the same kinds of conditions here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.900" end="00:36:50.550" style="s2">well and it&#39;s not even a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.020" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">perhaps we can create I mean you guys</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.550" end="00:36:55.560" style="s2">are creating and others are too but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:57.270" style="s2">becomes again natural selection is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.560" end="00:36:59.700" style="s2">when the conditions when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.270" end="00:37:02.040" style="s2">environmental conditions are such that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.700" end="00:37:04.860" style="s2">monastic communities thrive where other</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.040" end="00:37:07.260" style="s2">forms of organization don&#39;t monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.860" end="00:37:08.700" style="s2">will be popping up like new yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.260" end="00:37:10.890" style="s2">and we&#39;re already seeing this actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.700" end="00:37:13.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole new wave of monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.890" end="00:37:14.940" style="s2">I think III expect that we&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.350" end="00:37:17.700" style="s2">the tip of the iceberg I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.940" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">there will be many many many many more</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.700" end="00:37:21.630" style="s2">such kind of organizations in the coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:23.190" style="s2">years and I&#39;m hearing you know various</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.630" end="00:37:25.740" style="s2">kinds of chatter about them emerging</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.190" end="00:37:28.260" style="s2">it&#39;s really fascinating yes exactly I</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.740" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">mean assuming that climate tipping</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.260" end="00:37:31.890" style="s2">points don&#39;t really wag out in the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:34.500" style="s2">severe ways right</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.890" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely count honorable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.500" end="00:37:37.740" style="s2">again we learn this partly through</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:39.840" style="s2">history but also through understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.740" end="00:37:40.820" style="s2">evolution and what the conditions are</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.840" end="00:37:44.340" style="s2">that then</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.820" end="00:37:46.530" style="s2">allow for or facilitate the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.340" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">the title of your podcast emerged but</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.530" end="00:37:52.140" style="s2">the emergence of forms of organization</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:56.340" style="s2">that thrive best in various conditions</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.140" end="00:37:57.810" style="s2">yes yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s right and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.340" end="00:38:01.080" style="s2">I think you know for me I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.810" end="00:38:03.420" style="s2">somebody on my podcast about collapse</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.080" end="00:38:05.580" style="s2">and they said that one way to think</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.420" end="00:38:09.180" style="s2">about it is that it&#39;s like falling down</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.580" end="00:38:11.400" style="s2">a hill like a large hill right and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.180" end="00:38:12.869" style="s2">might happen in fits and starts like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.400" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">might fall down a portion and it might</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.869" end="00:38:15.990" style="s2">really bruise you and then you&#39;ll stand</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:18.150" style="s2">up to you like alright I&#39;m okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.990" end="00:38:21.510" style="s2">you&#39;ll fall down some more and you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.150" end="00:38:23.970" style="s2">keep going you keep going and one way he</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.510" end="00:38:26.430" style="s2">suggested to meet that challenge is just</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.970" end="00:38:28.500" style="s2">to walk in the bottom of the hill right</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.430" end="00:38:29.850" style="s2">just walk to the bottom a hill and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.500" end="00:38:32.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.850" end="00:38:33.960" style="s2">monastic training affords a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.010" end="00:38:36.540" style="s2">of that Sensibility right so many people</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.960" end="00:38:39.420" style="s2">in our culture are addicted to so much</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.540" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">that the idea of say like losing the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.420" end="00:38:46.830" style="s2">ability to use Instagram for a week is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:50.220" style="s2">anathema okay and so you can go and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.830" end="00:38:53.580" style="s2">hear like we can just just you know D</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.220" end="00:38:55.770" style="s2">grow our life essentially and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.580" end="00:38:58.980" style="s2">will tell you you know from personal</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.770" end="00:39:02.010" style="s2">experience you can be happier than you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.980" end="00:39:03.530" style="s2">would imagine possible doing nothing for</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.010" end="00:39:06.540" style="s2">a week</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.530" end="00:39:09.390" style="s2">nothing and so that even just that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.540" end="00:39:12.840" style="s2">should reorient anybody&#39;s relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.390" end="00:39:15.260" style="s2">to like things so any any those three</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.840" end="00:39:17.869" style="s2">human nature the big picture or</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.260" end="00:39:21.150" style="s2">impermanence and death that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.869" end="00:39:24.020" style="s2">just share anything on yeah I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.150" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">me the impermanence and death one is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.020" end="00:39:28.980" style="s2">it&#39;s really fascinating to me because</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:30.510" style="s2">you know in Buddhism which is to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.980" end="00:39:32.130" style="s2">tradition that I mostly practiced and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.510" end="00:39:33.869" style="s2">that&#39;s like its supposed to be a daily</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.130" end="00:39:37.170" style="s2">recollection you know you say something</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.869" end="00:39:40.020" style="s2">like I remember that my body is subject</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.170" end="00:39:41.580" style="s2">to aging and death and thus I practice</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.020" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">you know to work out my salvation or</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.580" end="00:39:45.240" style="s2">however you want to phrase it and for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:47.880" style="s2">as somebody who was like practicing when</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.240" end="00:39:51.420" style="s2">they&#39;re like 25 years old I was always</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.880" end="00:39:54.580" style="s2">thinking like yeah I guess but you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.420" end="00:39:57.460" style="s2">I got a lot of time it&#39;s gonna be fine</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.580" end="00:40:01.510" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll invent some kind of cure for</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.460" end="00:40:04.140" style="s2">death by the time I get real old like 50</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.510" end="00:40:04.140" style="s2">years old or something</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.690" end="00:40:10.150" style="s2">breakers well certainly yes some people</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.210" end="00:40:14.130" style="s2">are still going for that fantasy to live</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.150" end="00:40:18.340" style="s2">in perhaps but but but the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.130" end="00:40:21.010" style="s2">collapse has acted as a forcing function</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.340" end="00:40:23.350" style="s2">for me to contemplate my own demise has</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.010" end="00:40:25.810" style="s2">been incredible and I think that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.350" end="00:40:30.700" style="s2">a large part of what has allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.810" end="00:40:32.680" style="s2">kind of re-enter my life in this second</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.700" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">simplicity that I find myself in where</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.680" end="00:40:40.570" style="s2">it&#39;s just like Oh Who am I with who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:42.430" style="s2">here can I be with you you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.570" end="00:40:45.010" style="s2">so what I&#39;ve what I&#39;ve found is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.430" end="00:40:47.800" style="s2">actually those those recollections of</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.010" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">death have become much more potentiated</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.800" end="00:40:54.150" style="s2">knowing what I now know about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:56.710" style="s2">talking about and I&#39;ve also added in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.150" end="00:40:59.020" style="s2">recollection about the impermanence of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.710" end="00:41:02.170" style="s2">our civilization as a daily recollection</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.020" end="00:41:04.270" style="s2">just to kind of remember at this point I</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.170" end="00:41:06.010" style="s2">think it&#39;s kind of like you I I no</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.270" end="00:41:08.440" style="s2">longer take it for granted it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.010" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">much like I go and walk around right if</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.440" end="00:41:12.760" style="s2">I&#39;m in an airport everything just seems</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:14.650" style="s2">like I&#39;m like oh my goodness like look</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.760" end="00:41:18.600" style="s2">at this house of cards that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.650" end="00:41:21.880" style="s2">incredible amazing amazing amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.600" end="00:41:24.250" style="s2">yeah so that it&#39;s been interesting for</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.880" end="00:41:27.250" style="s2">me I think as somebody who&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.250" end="00:41:32.040" style="s2">younger end of the spectrum to really</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.250" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">feel like perhaps death is actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.040" end="00:41:36.460" style="s2">something coming much sooner than I</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:38.790" style="s2">would have thought even five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.460" end="00:41:40.990" style="s2">back when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.790" end="00:41:42.970" style="s2">voluntarily walking to the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.990" end="00:41:45.270" style="s2">hill reminded me of my favorite books by</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.970" end="00:41:47.860" style="s2">john michael greer which is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.270" end="00:41:50.110" style="s2">some of his blog post didn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.860" end="00:41:52.050" style="s2">into because he posted the art on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.110" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">Archdruid report every Wednesday night</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.050" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">for like 11 years he posted on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:58.540" style="s2">arcuate report and they were like 5060</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.910" style="s2">thousand of us that waited to see his</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.540" end="00:42:04.300" style="s2">posts every Wednesday night and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:06.550" style="s2">recorded like 400 of them I think but</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.300" end="00:42:09.330" style="s2">one of his books is titled collapse now</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.550" end="00:42:09.330" style="s2">and avoid the rush</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.630" end="00:42:18.580" style="s2">exactly the best good report exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:22.140" style="s2">that that sense of being so not just at</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.580" end="00:42:25.590" style="s2">peace with reality but joyously</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.140" end="00:42:28.420" style="s2">celebrational of reality as it really is</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.590" end="00:42:31.060" style="s2">including its challenges including its</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.420" end="00:42:33.490" style="s2">death and its end this being at peace</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.060" end="00:42:37.000" style="s2">with mortality with death with</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.490" end="00:42:38.590" style="s2">impermanence is is utterly invaluable</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.000" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the first steps that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.590" end="00:42:43.090" style="s2">encourage but again at people your age</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:46.270" style="s2">people hasn&#39;t younger 20-somethings</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.090" end="00:42:49.060" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean I I had a I was given a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.270" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">gift that when I was 21 years old or 20</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.060" end="00:42:52.660" style="s2">maybe I was 20 years old I was on top of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:55.000" style="s2">a mountain outside of Frankfurt Germany</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.660" end="00:42:56.980" style="s2">and you know had one of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:42:59.020" style="s2">most amazing mystical experiences of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.980" end="00:43:01.120" style="s2">life on the top of this mountain um</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.020" end="00:43:02.740" style="s2">where I was given a vision of my death</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.120" end="00:43:04.210" style="s2">even if I lived a hundred years and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.740" end="00:43:06.250" style="s2">was totally life-changing I you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.210" end="00:43:09.460" style="s2">most 20 21 year olds don&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.250" end="00:43:11.560" style="s2">mortality and I was I was given that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.460" end="00:43:13.960" style="s2">gift and it&#39;s made a huge difference so</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.560" end="00:43:16.780" style="s2">I did take a training with Joanna Macy</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.960" end="00:43:20.520" style="s2">where we did it some exercises in deep</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.780" end="00:43:23.830" style="s2">time yes and there&#39;s something in that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.520" end="00:43:26.500" style="s2">think that still resonates for me like</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.830" end="00:43:30.090" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;ll be meditating and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.500" end="00:43:33.190" style="s2">just get the perception of myself as</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.090" end="00:43:37.990" style="s2">that part of the earth that breathes</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.190" end="00:43:42.250" style="s2">like this and there&#39;s it&#39;s less about a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.990" end="00:43:45.640" style="s2">kind of temporal cosmology and more a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.250" end="00:43:49.330" style="s2">sense of like yes I am not so different</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.640" end="00:43:51.820" style="s2">than any of this that I see and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.330" end="00:43:53.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a great piece in that for me in</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.820" end="00:43:55.960" style="s2">coming to terms with the cascading</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.830" end="00:43:58.600" style="s2">problems of overshoot resource depletion</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.960" end="00:44:01.180" style="s2">climate breakdown etc have you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.600" end="00:44:03.310" style="s2">encountered stages of grieving that went</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.180" end="00:44:05.110" style="s2">beyond mere acceptance like what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.310" end="00:44:09.900" style="s2">opened up for you on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.110" end="00:44:09.900" style="s2">the post doom doorway there is this</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.960" end="00:44:15.580" style="s2">simplicity of being human that I&#39;ve at</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.690" end="00:44:18.460" style="s2">least for the time being seem to find</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.580" end="00:44:23.110" style="s2">myself in where it&#39;s like yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.460" end="00:44:26.830" style="s2">this is gonna end but here we are now</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.110" end="00:44:30.840" style="s2">and we get to be alive and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.830" end="00:44:34.570" style="s2">kind of gift a good gratefulness in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.840" end="00:44:40.900" style="s2">that&#39;s extremely sweet I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.570" end="00:44:42.070" style="s2">sweet than it ever was before yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.900" end="00:44:43.840" style="s2">actually haven&#39;t had that thought before</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.070" end="00:44:48.220" style="s2">but it does seem that way like that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.840" end="00:44:52.660" style="s2">that seems true to me yeah much more</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.220" end="00:44:55.030" style="s2">precious last question what&#39;s your take</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.660" end="00:44:57.010" style="s2">the it really is the question that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.030" end="00:44:59.170" style="s2">asked me before that I refuse to ask if</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.010" end="00:45:01.960" style="s2">you know what&#39;s your take on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.170" end="00:45:03.970" style="s2">beyond our control like and where we</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.960" end="00:45:05.710" style="s2">still can make a difference individually</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.970" end="00:45:07.600" style="s2">or collectively in other words what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.710" end="00:45:10.410" style="s2">your sense of what&#39;s no longer possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.600" end="00:45:14.080" style="s2">but then what still is possible I</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.410" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t read some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.080" end="00:45:19.090" style="s2">you&#39;ve recommended today and so I might</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:21.220" style="s2">need to recalibrate my vision of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.090" end="00:45:26.590" style="s2">possible based on what I have yet to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.220" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">learn but I do think that people that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.590" end="00:45:31.420" style="s2">see you talking to and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:34.750" style="s2">I&#39;m not so familiar with your work to</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.420" end="00:45:37.270" style="s2">know whether or not you account for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.750" end="00:45:40.630" style="s2">role that exponential technology could</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.270" end="00:45:43.990" style="s2">play as it encounter some of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.630" end="00:45:46.990" style="s2">collapse dynamics but frankly I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.990" end="00:45:51.070" style="s2">I&#39;m unsure I&#39;m unsure what the future is</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.990" end="00:45:54.520" style="s2">going to bring maybe it&#39;s a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.070" end="00:45:57.220" style="s2">understanding but it&#39;s also just a my</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.520" end="00:46:00.820" style="s2">information ecology is perhaps a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.220" end="00:46:03.750" style="s2">bit too wide like I see things from so</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.820" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">many different information sources I see</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.750" end="00:46:09.820" style="s2">so much technology that&#39;s being created</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:12.310" style="s2">that seems like it might solve</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.820" end="00:46:13.990" style="s2">particular dynamics and people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.310" end="00:46:16.030" style="s2">this and people are doing that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.990" end="00:46:18.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s possible but what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.030" end="00:46:22.630" style="s2">what I do know is worth dedicating our</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.370" end="00:46:25.270" style="s2">time to is is rebuilding the social</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.630" end="00:46:27.970" style="s2">networks that exist in locations like</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.270" end="00:46:30.040" style="s2">where I grew up in upstate New York</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.970" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I plan on doing when and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.040" end="00:46:34.450" style="s2">if I leave the monastery right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">sort of like weaving those social ties</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.450" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">together so that you know no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:43.960" style="s2">happens we go through it together</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:46.060" style="s2">yeah and so I think that no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.960" end="00:46:48.540" style="s2">your vision of the future is we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.060" end="00:46:52.180" style="s2">be better off if we have strong</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.540" end="00:46:54.460" style="s2">pro-social groups that are thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.180" end="00:46:57.910" style="s2">feeling and responding to the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.460" end="00:46:59.619" style="s2">together and that&#39;s really for me like</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.910" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">the only thing that I feel totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.619" end="00:47:05.320" style="s2">confident investing in it&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:08.530" style="s2">the the human skills in how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.320" end="00:47:12.520" style="s2">so for me that means healing healing my</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.530" end="00:47:16.359" style="s2">trauma you know waking up growing up</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.520" end="00:47:19.150" style="s2">cleaning up and then the actual like</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.359" end="00:47:23.290" style="s2">time spent in intimacy working together</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.150" end="00:47:26.080" style="s2">that builds those kinds of groups so</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.290" end="00:47:28.740" style="s2">that&#39;s really you know that&#39;s all it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.080" end="00:47:30.730" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s definitely worth it like</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.740" end="00:47:34.630" style="s2">everything else to me seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.730" end="00:47:36.820" style="s2">crapshoot but yeah yeah well I&#39;m so with</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.630" end="00:47:38.500" style="s2">you on that I&#39;m glad you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.820" end="00:47:39.760" style="s2">word technology because we didn&#39;t touch</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.500" end="00:47:42.780" style="s2">on that before when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.760" end="00:47:45.040" style="s2">about energy and ecology and overshoot</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.040" end="00:47:48.670" style="s2">just the summary you don&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.170" end="00:47:50.260" style="s2">read the whole book the summary he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.670" end="00:47:52.900" style="s2">a four page summary that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.260" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">fabulous but it&#39;s called techno fix why</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.900" end="00:47:57.700" style="s2">technology won&#39;t save us or the</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.589" end="00:48:22.570" style="s2">that benefits us hmm what that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.890" end="00:48:24.760" style="s2">harmful or or or toxic or in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.570" end="00:48:26.740" style="s2">just even neutral but if it doesn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.760" end="00:48:28.660" style="s2">into well into consideration the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.740" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">well-being of other species so it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">technology always creates more problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.730" end="00:48:39.220" style="s2">than it solves it just does it over time</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">the only forms of technology and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.220" end="00:48:41.970" style="s2">encourage anybody who is not sure about</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:44.780" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.970" end="00:48:46.980" style="s2">two examples that are counter-examples</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.630" end="00:49:02.510" style="s2">problems than they solve and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.740" end="00:49:05.700" style="s2">out that technologies need energy and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.510" end="00:49:08.790" style="s2">use when you start unpacking the energy</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.700" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">commute home well I I want to be clear I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.790" end="00:49:14.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t just mean like physical material</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:16.859" style="s2">technology I also mean social technology</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.460" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">yes and things like that I used that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.859" end="00:49:20.970" style="s2">more broadly like technique like ways of</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.500" end="00:49:31.800" style="s2">mimicking the wisdom of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.359" end="00:49:33.630" style="s2">technologies there&#39;s lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.800" end="00:49:34.950" style="s2">ways to design technology that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.630" end="00:49:36.420" style="s2">the things that Daniels bodkin Berger</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.950" end="00:49:38.490" style="s2">talks about is how do we design</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.420" end="00:49:41.970" style="s2">technology in a way that accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.490" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">its consequences yes and those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.970" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">pro-social technologies if what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:49.500" style="s2">by technology includes those social</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:52.770" style="s2">dynamics yes there&#39;s there are profound</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.500" end="00:49:54.510" style="s2">ways of organizing ourselves to for</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.510" end="00:49:59.579" style="s2">rather a collective stupidity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.030" end="00:50:02.819" style="s2">right and the emergence of something</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.579" end="00:50:05.250" style="s2">genuinely novel but genuinely life</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.819" end="00:50:06.869" style="s2">centered Pro future yeah and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.250" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">I hear daniel trachtenberg are</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.869" end="00:50:12.119" style="s2">explicitly calling for is AI minus a is</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:14.780" style="s2">more complexity in terms of the social</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.119" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">organism than in terms of the energy</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.780" end="00:50:21.300" style="s2">system any final things you want to say</p>

<p begin="00:50:38.450" end="00:50:42.470" style="s2">like this whole conversation I think I</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.070" end="00:50:52.900" style="s2">just there&#39;s been a sort of silence in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.470" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">me and and I there&#39;s a way in which I</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.900" end="00:51:06.410" style="s2">don&#39;t care about these ideas like I used</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:10.190" style="s2">to and there&#39;s a part of me that&#39;s</p>
