<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">variations of a similar question and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.550" end="00:00:58.440" style="s2">can answer whichever one you feel most</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">inspired to jump off from the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">variation of it is woody how did you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">sort of when you define think about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">work that you do what sort of threads it</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">together what sort of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">thread that you just keep pulling or an</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.960" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">another very that&#39;s looking back and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">another variation of the question is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">looking forward what are the current</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:19.009" style="s2">questions that you are most wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:21.720" style="s2">with you are spending your most time on</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.009" end="00:01:23.939" style="s2">trying to trying to figure out and hope</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.720" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">that you know many years from now when</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.939" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">you were retrospectively looking back at</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">the the work that you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">hope you&#39;ve you know taken a stab at or</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:35.610" style="s2">or made a dent in in in terms of your</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">contribution sure I think one way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.610" end="00:01:43.909" style="s2">talking about the central thread is how</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">do we best help improve humanities</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.909" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">wisdom the way that we individually and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">as various groups and all the way up to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">collectively make sense of what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">important and meaningful what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:01:59.909" style="s2">what the what a good design our strategy</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">to serve what&#39;s meaningful without</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.909" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">causing other problems is and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">make choices and coordinate joyce&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:11.489" style="s2">effectively towards a better world of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">the initiative world and so basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.489" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">sources of unnecessary suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:20.280" style="s2">particularly human induced unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:23.340" style="s2">suffering kind of all or intolerable to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.280" end="00:02:25.850" style="s2">me have always been and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.340" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">them right everything from the animal</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.850" end="00:02:33.050" style="s2">rights species extinction factory farm</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:35.340" style="s2">stuff to environmental devastation to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.050" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">untoward that could have been solved for</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.340" end="00:02:40.730" style="s2">other reasons that have economic</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">incentives and whatever to to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.730" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">escalation of those with increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">population and technology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">globalization and fragility that looks</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:53.640" style="s2">like catastrophic and existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:55.830" style="s2">and given that they there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:02:58.140" style="s2">that they&#39;re really unsolvable at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.830" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">level of each particular instance I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.140" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">been interested in not just how are they</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.019" style="s2">interconnected but what is underneath</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">and driving why humans are behaving in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.019" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">ways that generate those problems and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">that don&#39;t solve them and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:13.980" style="s2">you use the term civilization design</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">which is if we look at say species</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.980" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">extinction species extinction whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.329" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the decrease in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.019" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">whale populations or cutting down of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.329" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">old-growth forests or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:28.470" style="s2">whether we killed the theme for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">direct commoditization of it or we</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.470" end="00:03:31.799" style="s2">killed the habitat land it was because</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:34.440" style="s2">nature was worth more dead than alive so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.799" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">we had a perverse incentive situation we</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.440" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">can see a lot of situations where war is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">great for GDP and not war would be bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:43.860" style="s2">for GDP we&#39;re sick people are better for</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:46.950" style="s2">GDP where addiction is better for GDP</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.860" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">where and GDP as a whole in an aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2">or particular groups and so we start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:53.579" style="s2">look at Oh underneath lots of problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:55.829" style="s2">in the world is perverse incentive</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.579" end="00:03:57.660" style="s2">economic but also political etc so</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.829" end="00:04:00.329" style="s2">issues associated with differential</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.660" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">power and the ability for some agent to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.329" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">get ahead at the expense of other agents</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">or the Commons and then everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">playing those types of games up</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:09.600" style="s2">ratcheting their capacity to get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">at the cost of more expense being</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.600" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">externalized and you&#39;re not just talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:14.459" style="s2">about short term versus long term GDP</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.459" end="00:04:18.600" style="s2">misalignment at times between what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:21.539" style="s2">best for long term b2b or what&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.600" end="00:04:24.330" style="s2">for long term you know civilization well</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.539" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">interestingly what is best for long term</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.330" end="00:04:30.450" style="s2">consideration and what&#39;s best for others</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.820" end="00:04:32.220" style="s2">often times correspond because I might</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.450" end="00:04:34.140" style="s2">have a situation where what seems like</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.220" end="00:04:36.750" style="s2">the rational best choice for me in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.140" end="00:04:38.640" style="s2">short term that ends up damaging the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:40.170" style="s2">Commons or others also damages my</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.640" end="00:04:42.180" style="s2">possibility space in the long term</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.170" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">because now I live on a ecologically</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.180" end="00:04:48.750" style="s2">devastated planet or now I&#39;ve engendered</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:50.520" style="s2">more enmity from the other groups that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.750" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">won the battle but have not won the war</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.520" end="00:04:55.410" style="s2">and I deployed the asymmetric technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:04:58.410" style="s2">now they reverse engineered and are</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.410" end="00:05:00.630" style="s2">gonna deploy it back so we have these</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.410" end="00:05:02.670" style="s2">situations where every agent doing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.630" end="00:05:04.770" style="s2">thing that seems like the rational best</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.670" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">choice in the short term just focusing</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.770" end="00:05:09.660" style="s2">on them creates the worst possibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">space for the whole over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.660" end="00:05:13.170" style="s2">so this is an example of the like</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:14.700" style="s2">coordination failures that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.170" end="00:05:17.010" style="s2">underneath most of the problems in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.700" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">world I don&#39;t want to cut all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.010" end="00:05:21.030" style="s2">trees down and I don&#39;t need to but if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">don&#39;t the other guy&#39;s going to so me not</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.030" end="00:05:24.750" style="s2">doing it doesn&#39;t leave a forest and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:26.850" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna use his increased economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.750" end="00:05:28.410" style="s2">power to beat me in some other important</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.850" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">ways so now we actually race to cut it</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.410" end="00:05:32.820" style="s2">down as fast as possible or do we see</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.470" style="s2">tragedy of the Commons type scenarios or</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.820" end="00:05:36.840" style="s2">we have to race to build the AI weapons</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.470" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">before the other guy so arms races</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">tragedy of the Commons are examples of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">multipolar traps where no one is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:45.870" style="s2">maliciously doing the bad thing and yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:47.760" style="s2">everyone&#39;s racing to do the disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.870" end="00:05:50.670" style="s2">things I think they start codecs called</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.760" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">this Moloch yes the meditations on</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.670" end="00:05:54.900" style="s2">Moloch is required reading yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:05:57.240" style="s2">you know you asked me before we started</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.900" end="00:05:58.890" style="s2">talking how I discovered your work and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.240" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">mentioned I would crypto Rabideau would</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.890" end="00:06:02.520" style="s2">let me do the gaming rathole and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">discovered you know a few years ago sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.520" end="00:06:06.660" style="s2">of this literature around progress and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">and Tyler Cowen and his book stubborn</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.660" end="00:06:11.270" style="s2">attachments and how you know improving</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.400" end="00:06:27.750" style="s2">know I read things like you know</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.750" end="00:06:31.710" style="s2">know says that economic growth is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.310" end="00:06:33.450" style="s2">inherently unsustainable you try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.710" end="00:06:35.250" style="s2">innovate your way through it but you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.450" end="00:06:37.350" style="s2">know that you&#39;ll reach some limits but</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.250" end="00:06:40.540" style="s2">then I read things like Andrew McAfee&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.350" end="00:06:43.030" style="s2">more from West&#39;s where it says hey</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.540" end="00:06:44.980" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve now decoupled resource</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.030" end="00:06:47.320" style="s2">consumption or resource usage from</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.180" end="00:06:53.110" style="s2">who&#39;s right which do we get to innovate</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.490" end="00:06:55.420" style="s2">through it is the only way out is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.110" end="00:06:57.640" style="s2">through or do you have to sub you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.420" end="00:06:59.410" style="s2">have this radical Reformation of how we</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.640" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">how we run our economy more Charles</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.410" end="00:07:04.990" style="s2">Eisenstein stuff and so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">question to you then how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.990" end="00:07:09.510" style="s2">about that yeah so let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:13.720" style="s2">limits of growth and upper bounds and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.510" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">that kind of question so obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.720" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">growth of the materials economy and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:22.870" style="s2">domain of atoms is different than in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">domain of bits and we would be silly to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.870" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">not acknowledge that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">difference and there&#39;s a third</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">difference in terms of the physics of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:31.990" style="s2">the materials economy the domain of</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.030" end="00:07:40.710" style="s2">conservation laws so we have two</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.290" end="00:07:44.200" style="s2">different accounting for them we have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.710" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">finite amount of atoms of various types</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.200" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">and of course via better mining</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">technologies whatever and turning the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">atoms and the molecules for better</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:54.700" style="s2">chemistry type technologies we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:56.440" style="s2">modulate that to some degree but we also</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.700" end="00:07:57.730" style="s2">have upper bounds on that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.440" end="00:07:59.200" style="s2">important to realize that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.730" end="00:08:00.640" style="s2">getting the atoms that&#39;s what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.200" end="00:08:04.300" style="s2">with them after the fact which is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.640" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">waste management so for the most part so</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.300" end="00:08:08.830" style="s2">far humanity&#39;s had a linear materials</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:10.840" style="s2">economy where we take resources out of</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:18.940" style="s2">net depletion and then we use them for</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.940" end="00:08:22.060" style="s2">put them back into the earth in a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.470" end="00:08:24.310" style="s2">that they can&#39;t actually be reabsorbed</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.729" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">in an ecosystem are made of the same</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:45.520" style="s2">recycled and so anything dies and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.930" end="00:08:47.230" style="s2">becomes food for new things and the food</p>

<p begin="00:08:53.740" end="00:08:56.070" style="s2">this issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.460" end="00:08:59.350" style="s2">part of the antifragility of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.070" end="00:09:00.970" style="s2">Ecology&#39;s work so obviously we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.350" end="00:09:03.250" style="s2">move from a linear materials economy to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.970" end="00:09:05.260" style="s2">a closed-loop economy that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.250" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">straightforward where we take</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:11.710" style="s2">atomic cycles so we aren&#39;t producing</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.710" end="00:09:16.210" style="s2">the other now we can keep cycling them</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.650" end="00:09:18.400" style="s2">so we don&#39;t have a situation that once</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.210" end="00:09:19.900" style="s2">we&#39;ve used it it&#39;s gone right but we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.400" end="00:09:22.420" style="s2">have a situation where we start moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.900" end="00:09:25.090" style="s2">from increased growth of the number of</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.560" end="00:09:34.420" style="s2">more interesting forms the forms are</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.420" end="00:09:39.730" style="s2">pattern of bits and obviously the bits</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.730" end="00:09:44.050" style="s2">limit to them than the atoms do so atoms</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.700" end="00:09:47.140" style="s2">we have to think about closed-loop</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.050" end="00:09:50.920" style="s2">accounting on now to be able to process</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.850" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have an indefinite amount</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.340" end="00:10:09.850" style="s2">of energy so we have to be cycling the</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.850" end="00:10:13.510" style="s2">bandwidth and we have basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.290" end="00:10:16.690" style="s2">unlimited amount of bit pattern limited</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.510" end="00:10:18.580" style="s2">only by the energy and atom needs of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:21.730" style="s2">computational substrate but then the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.580" end="00:10:24.990" style="s2">bits are only useful in so far as they</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.730" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">can actually be put into form and or</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.990" end="00:10:29.140" style="s2">there is limited human attention to be</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.180" end="00:10:41.170" style="s2">this equation and so when people look at</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.620" end="00:12:20.200" style="s2">attention is trying to put any degree of</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.760" end="00:12:30.850" style="s2">type warfare so we have to stop thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.370" end="00:12:32.830" style="s2">about the attention economy that way and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.850" end="00:12:34.180" style="s2">so now we can start to look at why we</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.830" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">think of it that way and what would it</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.180" end="00:12:38.200" style="s2">take to change the macro economics</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:40.510" style="s2">underneath that so are there fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.200" end="00:12:43.710" style="s2">limits of growth yes can we create more</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.510" end="00:12:47.350" style="s2">efficiency to where those limits are</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.710" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">extending but still bounded yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.350" end="00:12:51.660" style="s2">you will get to a place of diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:57.130" style="s2">returns on the increased efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">where we don&#39;t have increased resource</p>

<p begin="00:13:02.110" end="00:13:05.710" style="s2">curve forever we&#39;ll get diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.130" end="00:13:09.460" style="s2">return and so we do have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.710" end="00:13:11.620" style="s2">planetary boundaries in a intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.460" end="00:13:13.480" style="s2">way and do we do we have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.620" end="00:13:16.630" style="s2">that in a way that sort of top debt like</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.480" end="00:13:18.190" style="s2">do we steer the market a little bit or</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.630" end="00:13:19.570" style="s2">that you know do we have to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.190" end="00:13:20.739" style="s2">or will the market sort of figure that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.570" end="00:13:24.019" style="s2">out on</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.739" end="00:13:27.290" style="s2">or solve problems on its own agency we</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.249" end="00:13:34.309" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t have been true then and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.929" end="00:13:37.009" style="s2">super not true once you have bank</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.309" end="00:13:40.339" style="s2">bailouts and you subsidize oil companies</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.009" end="00:13:43.369" style="s2">and you have monopolistic kind of</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.369" end="00:13:47.689" style="s2">and things like that so that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.980" end="00:13:51.860" style="s2">self-correcting nature of a market there</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.689" end="00:13:54.139" style="s2">also when you think about fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.860" end="00:13:56.389" style="s2">like theory of why a market would self</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.139" end="00:13:57.709" style="s2">correct you have this idea that humans</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.389" end="00:13:59.059" style="s2">are going to be sense making what they</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.709" end="00:14:00.799" style="s2">actually want that provides a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.059" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">quality of life and that that expresses</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.799" end="00:14:06.470" style="s2">itself as demand and the demand is kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:07.970" style="s2">of the environmental niche if we try and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.470" end="00:14:09.829" style="s2">reify this with evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:12.889" style="s2">refight area of markets devolution in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.829" end="00:14:14.839" style="s2">theory the demand causes an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.889" end="00:14:16.339" style="s2">nation which different providers of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.839" end="00:14:19.129" style="s2">products and services that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.339" end="00:14:20.569" style="s2">demand for emerge and so the variations</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.129" end="00:14:22.209" style="s2">and how they make their product or</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.569" end="00:14:25.009" style="s2">service are kind of like mutation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.209" end="00:14:27.290" style="s2">then some of the companies will succeed</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.009" end="00:14:29.419" style="s2">in to that survival selection and some</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.290" end="00:14:30.860" style="s2">won&#39;t and then a couple companies that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.419" end="00:14:32.419" style="s2">have different IP or a different</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.860" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">approach or different market segments</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.419" end="00:14:36.019" style="s2">might merge and so that&#39;s like mate</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:39.049" style="s2">dynamics where you get combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.019" end="00:14:41.779" style="s2">dynamics so the idea is that markets are</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.049" end="00:14:44.419" style="s2">like evolution and so there is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.779" end="00:14:47.119" style="s2">of correcting increasing complexity type</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.419" end="00:14:49.669" style="s2">dynamic and of course that people</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.119" end="00:14:51.439" style="s2">competing against each other to provide</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.669" end="00:14:53.629" style="s2">the best products and services at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.439" end="00:14:56.119" style="s2">best value to rational agents will pick</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.629" end="00:14:57.799" style="s2">the rationally best choice is what</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.119" end="00:15:00.799" style="s2">actually increases the quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.799" end="00:15:03.559" style="s2">for everyone this is a cute idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.799" end="00:15:05.299" style="s2">obviously silly because there was a meme</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.559" end="00:15:07.699" style="s2">going around on Facebook that said that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.299" end="00:15:10.579" style="s2">the smartest people go to the best</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.699" end="00:15:12.110" style="s2">colleges to go work at the biggest tech</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.329" end="00:15:21.110" style="s2">the market the moment that you can</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.179" end="00:15:26.540" style="s2">important to understand that supply and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.949" end="00:15:27.379" style="s2">demand will have a cemetery between them</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.379" end="00:15:31.220" style="s2">meaning the company that&#39;s supplying in</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.220" end="00:15:34.100" style="s2">but there is no coordination or</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.100" end="00:15:37.339" style="s2">body of all the customers but there is a</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.339" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">side so it&#39;s really the supply supply</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.009" end="00:15:45.290" style="s2">side against a single customer that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:47.180" style="s2">an asymmetric dynamic that doesn&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.160" end="00:16:54.019" style="s2">then that government&#39;s the whole idea of</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.420" end="00:19:39.620" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if I actually answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.880" end="00:19:42.020" style="s2">your question I said that the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.620" end="00:19:43.910" style="s2">myth that there is this thing called a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.020" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">market and it has self-correcting</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.910" end="00:19:49.400" style="s2">properties is is really important leap</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">gibberish and we have to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.400" end="00:19:54.910" style="s2">that if we want to think sanely about</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:58.340" style="s2">things that so here&#39;s to take a stab at</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.910" end="00:20:00.470" style="s2">alternatives or even characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.340" end="00:20:02.330" style="s2">alternatives that could emerge in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.470" end="00:20:03.650" style="s2">maybe the medium term and so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.330" end="00:20:04.669" style="s2">mentioned the attention economy the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.650" end="00:20:07.100" style="s2">problems of that like what&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.669" end="00:20:08.390" style="s2">alternative to that or for exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.100" end="00:20:10.780" style="s2">you you&#39;ve talked to in previous talks</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.390" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">about how you know when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.780" end="00:20:15.559" style="s2">regulating a market people get concerned</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:17.240" style="s2">start thinking about communism and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.559" end="00:20:18.830" style="s2">that&#39;s not really talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.240" end="00:20:20.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve also talked about how you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.830" end="00:20:22.549" style="s2">it&#39;s not democracy is all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.570" end="00:20:24.860" style="s2">failures with it like you all this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.549" end="00:20:28.909" style="s2">that we currently have aren&#39;t up for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.860" end="00:20:31.370" style="s2">task or that don&#39;t meet the the problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.909" end="00:20:36.530" style="s2">that we currently face so what does or</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.370" end="00:20:38.330" style="s2">what could yeah so fundamental principle</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.530" end="00:20:39.380" style="s2">that we have to factor is that any game</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.330" end="00:20:42.860" style="s2">can be gained</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.380" end="00:20:46.130" style="s2">the moment you define what the success</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.860" end="00:20:47.570" style="s2">criteria is and what the laws and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.130" end="00:20:49.190" style="s2">whatever there will be places where you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.570" end="00:20:51.230" style="s2">can violate the spirit of the law while</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.190" end="00:20:52.760" style="s2">meeting the letter of the law there will</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.230" end="00:20:54.530" style="s2">be places where you can figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.760" end="00:20:56.179" style="s2">to externalize some cost to something</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.530" end="00:20:58.280" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t accounted for in the model</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.179" end="00:20:59.690" style="s2">well being able to benefit it the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.280" end="00:21:01.010" style="s2">that was accounted there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.690" end="00:21:03.049" style="s2">place where you can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.010" end="00:21:05.350" style="s2">have plausible deniability or hide</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.049" end="00:21:09.169" style="s2">culpability to be able to get ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.350" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s an important thing to understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.169" end="00:21:13.190" style="s2">there is no such thing as a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:16.460" style="s2">social system and there never will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.190" end="00:21:17.929" style="s2">and meaning when we think about a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.460" end="00:21:21.260" style="s2">perfect social system when we try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.929" end="00:21:23.030" style="s2">imagine what that would be what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.260" end="00:21:24.980" style="s2">usually thinking about is okay how do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.030" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">remove all the perverse incentives from</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.980" end="00:21:29.809" style="s2">the system such that no one ever has an</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:32.570" style="s2">incentive to do something that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.809" end="00:21:35.059" style="s2">for anybody and how do we make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.570" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">the system of incentives predisposes</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.059" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">everyone to make the most on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:39.980" style="s2">considerate positive choices for them in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">the whole in the near term in the long</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.980" end="00:21:46.220" style="s2">term and what we&#39;re actually asking is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:48.169" style="s2">how do we remove choice and make a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.220" end="00:21:51.320" style="s2">system that predisposes everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.169" end="00:21:53.809" style="s2">choice in a particular way and as long</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.320" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">as there is the reality of choices the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.809" end="00:21:59.320" style="s2">reality of the possibility of people</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">making choices that are intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.320" end="00:22:04.010" style="s2">benefiting the whole but wrong mister</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:04.970" style="s2">mistake theory or not intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.010" end="00:22:07.190" style="s2">benefiting the whole or even</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.970" end="00:22:09.530" style="s2">intentionally damaging this this is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.190" end="00:22:12.649" style="s2">important concept I&#39;ll come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.530" end="00:22:14.029" style="s2">more tangible in a moment but I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.649" end="00:22:16.849" style="s2">you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.029" end="00:22:19.549" style="s2">that if you try to define meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.849" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">like the meaningfulness of existence of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.549" end="00:22:24.529" style="s2">life you won&#39;t be able to find any</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:25.999" style="s2">definition that doesn&#39;t bind the concept</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.529" end="00:22:31.309" style="s2">of meaningfulness to the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.999" end="00:22:33.369" style="s2">choice and so insofar as we are we would</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.309" end="00:22:35.719" style="s2">seek to make a system that actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.369" end="00:22:38.539" style="s2">compels people&#39;s choice to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.719" end="00:22:40.249" style="s2">particular way so their choice is no</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.539" end="00:22:41.919" style="s2">longer actually choice it&#39;s the result</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.249" end="00:22:44.389" style="s2">of the causation of social engineering</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.919" end="00:22:47.109" style="s2">we&#39;re actually trying to make a system</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.389" end="00:22:51.159" style="s2">that debases the basis of meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.109" end="00:22:53.869" style="s2">so and i can also say that there will be</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.159" end="00:22:56.929" style="s2">no matter if i have a system that tries</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.869" end="00:22:59.029" style="s2">to look at a bunch of metrics not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.929" end="00:23:00.409" style="s2">GDP but i&#39;m gonna look at a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.029" end="00:23:02.119" style="s2">things that are metrics that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.409" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">uncommon terrible so I&#39;m gonna look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.119" end="00:23:05.869" style="s2">co2 and nitrogen affluence and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:07.849" style="s2">microbiome of the soil whatever all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.869" end="00:23:10.549" style="s2">things I can and factor them into some</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.849" end="00:23:13.279" style="s2">complex system optimization waiting</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.549" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">function there will always be metrics</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.279" end="00:23:16.789" style="s2">that matter that aren&#39;t included that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:19.070" style="s2">don&#39;t even know exist yet the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.789" end="00:23:21.739" style="s2">unknown set is never factorable into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.070" end="00:23:22.099" style="s2">thing and so there isn&#39;t a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.739" end="00:23:23.899" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.099" end="00:23:25.309" style="s2">this is Asimov science as the ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.899" end="00:23:27.469" style="s2">writing of wrong there is only</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.309" end="00:23:29.629" style="s2">progressively hopefully better systems</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.469" end="00:23:31.489" style="s2">where the failures in the current system</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.629" end="00:23:34.070" style="s2">get acknowledged and improved but that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.489" end="00:23:36.289" style="s2">takes humans that have a kind of general</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.070" end="00:23:37.849" style="s2">intelligence beyond the system dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.289" end="00:23:40.099" style="s2">to notice what&#39;s wrong with the system</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.849" end="00:23:41.989" style="s2">and make choices that the system is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.099" end="00:23:44.210" style="s2">predisposing to make good choices</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.989" end="00:23:46.279" style="s2">independent of system predisposition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.210" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">to then also work to improve the system</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.279" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">so we want to make the best systems that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:53.599" style="s2">we can we also want to develop humans</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:55.609" style="s2">that make choices not just influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.599" end="00:23:59.109" style="s2">but beyond the influence of the current</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.609" end="00:24:02.599" style="s2">types of social coordination systems so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.109" end="00:24:05.059" style="s2">the reason I say this is because what</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.599" end="00:24:07.009" style="s2">that means is that there is no answer to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.059" end="00:24:09.559" style="s2">a civilization that doesn&#39;t totally suck</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.770" end="00:29:11.210" style="s2">measure it and so there&#39;s this conundrum</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:19.309" style="s2">and not corrupt it in the process do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.020" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">just acknowledge that there are certain</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:24.860" style="s2">measure and you need to find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:27.080" style="s2">prioritize it or do you get rid of all</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.860" end="00:29:29.270" style="s2">metrics altogether and yet that seems</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.080" end="00:29:31.250" style="s2">exactly these all seem like a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.270" end="00:29:33.559" style="s2">solution of course you don&#39;t get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.250" end="00:29:35.480" style="s2">all metrics but you have a choice making</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.559" end="00:29:37.909" style="s2">process that is informed by but not</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.480" end="00:29:41.059" style="s2">determined by the metrics because there</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.909" end="00:29:43.220" style="s2">will be a general intelligence capacity</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.070" end="00:30:35.149" style="s2">that you did and 90% of them said no we</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.470" end="00:30:36.350" style="s2">actually like we started too and then we</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.149" end="00:30:37.909" style="s2">didn&#39;t believe in it and then they were</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.350" end="00:30:39.350" style="s2">asked did you try and stop and all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.909" end="00:30:41.149" style="s2">them said no we didn&#39;t try and stop and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.350" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">then when asked why they quoted the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.149" end="00:30:44.059" style="s2">German phrase that said something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:46.220" style="s2">officers orders we didn&#39;t have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.059" end="00:30:49.190" style="s2">so the moment that you say fiduciary</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.220" end="00:30:51.049" style="s2">responsibility or company policy or this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.190" end="00:30:53.659" style="s2">is what I gotta do to you know compete</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.049" end="00:30:56.179" style="s2">with the market you can be a Nazi right</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.659" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">you can actually remove all ethical</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.179" end="00:31:00.830" style="s2">culpability by saying you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:02.929" style="s2">choice so the question was how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.830" end="00:31:04.789" style="s2">develop good stewards of choice and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.929" end="00:31:06.289" style="s2">can see that it&#39;s not only the sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.789" end="00:31:07.560" style="s2">making the calculate stuff well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.289" end="00:31:10.020" style="s2">also things like</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.560" end="00:31:12.690" style="s2">it&#39;s also things like depth of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.020" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">congruency and knowing ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.690" end="00:31:16.380" style="s2">your life is in service to and what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:18.330" style="s2">meaningful to you and what matters</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.380" end="00:31:21.690" style="s2">beyond what any dashboard might be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.330" end="00:31:22.890" style="s2">to represent yeah knowing and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.690" end="00:31:25.950" style="s2">difference between virtue and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.890" end="00:31:29.400" style="s2">signaling virtue is where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.950" end="00:31:31.650" style="s2">something that matters to me that is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.400" end="00:31:33.540" style="s2">expressed in some type of game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.650" end="00:31:37.190" style="s2">advantage it&#39;s not expressed in dollars</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.540" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">or likes or tweets or status or election</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.190" end="00:31:42.110" style="s2">that I am willing to sacrifice those</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:46.530" style="s2">game theoretic advantage in service of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.110" end="00:31:48.780" style="s2">virtue signaling is using the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.530" end="00:31:50.670" style="s2">performance of a virtue that people will</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.780" end="00:31:53.250" style="s2">care about to get more game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.670" end="00:31:55.220" style="s2">advantage and when it comes down to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.250" end="00:31:57.480" style="s2">two masters issue of will I actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.220" end="00:31:59.400" style="s2">sacrifice um personal game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.480" end="00:32:01.830" style="s2">advantage and service of this if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.400" end="00:32:04.860" style="s2">answer is no with some justification its</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.830" end="00:32:07.770" style="s2">virtue signaling and so this then</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.860" end="00:32:09.480" style="s2">becomes a core thing and choice is where</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.770" end="00:32:12.180" style="s2">am I willing to do something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.480" end="00:32:13.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t maximize profits it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.180" end="00:32:15.330" style="s2">that it makes me unprofitable or crashes</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.740" end="00:32:16.350" style="s2">my company right but where am I willing</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.330" end="00:32:18.510" style="s2">to do something that doesn&#39;t maximize</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.350" end="00:32:20.430" style="s2">profits or slows the speed of growth or</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.510" end="00:32:22.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t maximize market capture or</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.430" end="00:32:24.540" style="s2">whatever because there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.230" end="00:32:27.690" style="s2">I care about that I&#39;m actually committed</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.540" end="00:32:29.970" style="s2">to that I have devotion to deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.690" end="00:32:32.520" style="s2">that thing and if people don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.970" end="00:32:35.550" style="s2">answer to that then I don&#39;t trust them</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.520" end="00:32:37.530" style="s2">as stewards of choice at all and is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.550" end="00:32:39.750" style="s2">also being good steward of choice is</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.530" end="00:32:42.450" style="s2">understanding the power of but also the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.750" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">limitations of the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.450" end="00:32:48.360" style="s2">or scientism or that as the main sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:50.160" style="s2">guide for how you make decisions or</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.360" end="00:32:53.220" style="s2">determine what&#39;s what&#39;s meaningful or</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.160" end="00:32:54.870" style="s2">makes sense yeah so just like you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.220" end="00:32:56.970" style="s2">saying do we get rid of metrics or not</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.870" end="00:32:59.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a and the answer is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.970" end="00:33:01.380" style="s2">informed by but not determined by we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.370" end="00:33:03.060" style="s2">informed by scientific process and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.380" end="00:33:05.220" style="s2">methodology but that doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.060" end="00:33:08.730" style="s2">determine the choice and so when asked</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.220" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">to ask what is what is the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.730" end="00:33:15.480" style="s2">that is relevant to influencing choice</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:18.270" style="s2">that includes but is not limited to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.480" end="00:33:21.060" style="s2">methods of science because you know we</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.270" end="00:33:21.539" style="s2">have this classic is odd distinction</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.060" end="00:33:23.549" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.539" end="00:33:26.309" style="s2">and science can say what is it can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.549" end="00:33:27.629" style="s2">what odd because science specifically</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.309" end="00:33:28.919" style="s2">the way you know there are some</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.629" end="00:33:31.289" style="s2">extensions but the way we think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.919" end="00:33:33.629" style="s2">science in a pop arian sense is it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.289" end="00:33:35.159" style="s2">the epistemology to study things in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.629" end="00:33:37.080" style="s2">domain of the measurable and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.159" end="00:33:39.359" style="s2">repeatable something has to be both</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.080" end="00:33:41.309" style="s2">measurable and repeatable to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.359" end="00:33:42.690" style="s2">be subject well there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.309" end="00:33:45.029" style="s2">are real that are measurable but not</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.690" end="00:33:46.350" style="s2">repeatable there are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.029" end="00:33:48.509" style="s2">real that are not measurable measurable</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.350" end="00:33:50.669" style="s2">is in the domain of third person and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.509" end="00:33:52.889" style="s2">obviously first person itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.669" end="00:33:55.559" style="s2">measurable you can measure third person</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.889" end="00:33:56.970" style="s2">neural correlates that and then over</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.559" end="00:33:59.639" style="s2">norm how well you think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.970" end="00:34:01.799" style="s2">correlated and use a physicalist</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.639" end="00:34:04.470" style="s2">assumption to say that physical is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.799" end="00:34:06.029" style="s2">primary and first third person was</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.470" end="00:34:08.700" style="s2">primary and first person must have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.029" end="00:34:10.049" style="s2">a phenominal none of which is grounded</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.700" end="00:34:13.169" style="s2">in anything other than a self</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.049" end="00:34:14.790" style="s2">referential assumption so the real is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.169" end="00:34:18.030" style="s2">not exclusively measurable and</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.790" end="00:34:21.030" style="s2">repeatable so science is a necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.030" end="00:34:23.429" style="s2">not sufficient epistemology so when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.030" end="00:34:26.429" style="s2">asking questions about choice making I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.429" end="00:34:27.809" style="s2">asking aunt questions not just it now</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.429" end="00:34:30.270" style="s2">they have to be informed by AZ otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.809" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">they&#39;re ungrounded right so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.270" end="00:34:34.460" style="s2">problems here is that the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:37.079" style="s2">science gave us so much power over</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.460" end="00:34:39.089" style="s2">religions and other things to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.079" end="00:34:40.829" style="s2">understand the physical world and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.089" end="00:34:42.599" style="s2">apply that as technology and engineering</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.829" end="00:34:45.750" style="s2">to have more power over the physical</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.599" end="00:34:47.579" style="s2">world so anyone who paid attention to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.750" end="00:34:49.260" style="s2">Newton&#39;s calculus could make cannon</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.579" end="00:34:51.990" style="s2">balls hit the target way better than the</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.990" end="00:34:56.490" style="s2">lot of things so those who kind of paid</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.329" end="00:34:59.369" style="s2">attention to it just started to win via</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.490" end="00:35:01.890" style="s2">war economic war or military war or</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.369" end="00:35:03.720" style="s2">whatever was but then what happens is we</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.890" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">have a dominant system a dominant kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.720" end="00:35:10.650" style="s2">of philosophic system it says we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:12.839" style="s2">say what a good choice is there is no</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:14.849" style="s2">basis for the there is no reification of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.839" end="00:35:16.650" style="s2">the concept of good or the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.849" end="00:35:18.210" style="s2">choice both of those are concepts that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.650" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">we don&#39;t actually understand so we</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.210" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">assume choices summed up causation from</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:23.609" style="s2">particle physics in the brain or jeans</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.839" end="00:35:26.970" style="s2">or whatever domain we happen to study</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.609" end="00:35:29.220" style="s2">and good is purely a nonsense social</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.970" end="00:35:31.170" style="s2">construct the best we can do is look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.220" end="00:35:32.549" style="s2">evolutionary biology reo fight with game</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.170" end="00:35:34.349" style="s2">theory and say good is that which</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.549" end="00:35:34.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lose in a rival risk context</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.349" end="00:35:36.750" style="s2">maybe trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.920" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">reified down to thermodynamics and say</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.750" end="00:35:42.119" style="s2">who can garner the more the most scarce</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:44.910" style="s2">thermodynamic energy right but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.119" end="00:35:48.540" style="s2">not actually a definition of good in any</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.910" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">meaningful way and so good choice is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.540" end="00:35:52.380" style="s2">both of the words are outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:54.990" style="s2">domain of the philosophy of science and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.380" end="00:35:56.430" style="s2">yet it&#39;s gonna create all the power that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.990" end="00:35:59.099" style="s2">empowers the choices that were making</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.430" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">through whatever methodology to be more</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.099" end="00:36:04.910" style="s2">powerful in this win and so then we say</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:07.049" style="s2">okay well if science gets applied as</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.910" end="00:36:10.109" style="s2">technology which increases our ability</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.049" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">for warfare and economic extraction and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.109" end="00:36:14.760" style="s2">production and narrative control and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">know information control and all those</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.760" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">things then what is guiding how that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:24.299" style="s2">technology is implemented well the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:26.940" style="s2">economics that funds it and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.299" end="00:36:28.950" style="s2">economics is basically saying a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.940" end="00:36:32.730" style="s2">choice is the game theoretic choice that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.950" end="00:36:34.380" style="s2">wins so when you have technology and</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.089" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">that was</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.250" end="00:40:17.000" style="s2">if you look at an ecosystem and you look</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.900" end="00:40:19.250" style="s2">at the relationships of gas exchange</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.000" end="00:40:29.059" style="s2">see that most of the things are actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.270" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">very codependent interdependent you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.059" end="00:40:34.579" style="s2">symbiotic it happens to be that the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:37.010" style="s2">competitive things just stand out in an</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.579" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">interesting way right when when Bucks</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:43.819" style="s2">obviously stands out and it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.780" end="00:40:45.890" style="s2">being that of course really focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.819" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">that whoever really focuses on that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.890" end="00:40:52.010" style="s2">wins Wars those memes get selected for</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:53.329" style="s2">and so in the same way that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.010" end="00:40:55.220" style="s2">genes that have certain camp dominance</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.329" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">get selected for so do memes even if</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.220" end="00:41:00.470" style="s2">they aren&#39;t actually holistic or true or</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:02.270" style="s2">you know in that sense so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.470" end="00:41:05.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot we could talk about of not</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.270" end="00:41:06.260" style="s2">just looking at individual animal</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.030" end="00:41:08.180" style="s2">selection or individual species</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.260" end="00:41:09.980" style="s2">selection but selection at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.180" end="00:41:11.740" style="s2">whole ecosystems that&#39;s really critical</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.980" end="00:41:15.410" style="s2">because obviously if an individual</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.740" end="00:41:17.029" style="s2">species got so successful relative to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.410" end="00:41:19.880" style="s2">the other species that it depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.029" end="00:41:22.369" style="s2">that it debased the ecosystem that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.880" end="00:41:24.670" style="s2">depends on its own short-term success</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.369" end="00:41:26.809" style="s2">would kill its long-term success and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.670" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">this happens right like we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.809" end="00:41:31.069" style="s2">invasive species come in devastate an</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.420" style="s2">ecosystem and then they&#39;re gone and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.069" end="00:41:34.359" style="s2">the only things that make it through</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.420" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">long term are the things that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.359" end="00:41:40.670" style="s2">self stabilizing Ecology&#39;s but when we</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:42.200" style="s2">don&#39;t pay attention to that part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.670" end="00:41:44.900" style="s2">evolutionary theory when we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.200" end="00:41:48.859" style="s2">justifying being the apex predator in</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.900" end="00:41:49.940" style="s2">the market so that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.859" end="00:41:51.859" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things like that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.940" end="00:41:54.279" style="s2">are very important but I think the main</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.859" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">thing I would give is that the moment we</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.279" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">understood how to create tools via</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:42:00.799" style="s2">abstraction we were no longer</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:04.010" style="s2">evolutionarily precedented and so we</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.799" end="00:42:08.210" style="s2">can&#39;t apply evolutionary theory to us in</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.010" end="00:42:10.700" style="s2">the same way and all you&#39;ve got to do is</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.210" end="00:42:12.520" style="s2">just like look at a gorilla attacking</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.700" end="00:42:15.170" style="s2">and then watch a nuclear bomb go off and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.520" end="00:42:15.800" style="s2">look at a beaver cutting trees down and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.170" end="00:42:17.930" style="s2">then watch</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.800" end="00:42:19.940" style="s2">and burn and look at a great white</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.930" end="00:42:22.310" style="s2">eating tuna and then look at a mile-long</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.940" end="00:42:23.750" style="s2">driftnet pulling up you know hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.310" end="00:42:26.360" style="s2">tons of fish and you&#39;re like oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.750" end="00:42:29.630" style="s2">not apex predators right look at</p>

<p begin="00:42:33.830" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">into it and so okay we are not</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:43.880" style="s2">religions talked about us being between</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:42:59.240" style="s2">like the power of what we would ascribe</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.260" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">to who can create and maintain and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.240" end="00:43:05.060" style="s2">destroy the whole and so if you have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:06.950" style="s2">power of gods and you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.060" end="00:43:09.530" style="s2">right choice making to hold that power</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.950" end="00:43:12.430" style="s2">ie the love and wisdom and prudence of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.530" end="00:43:15.050" style="s2">gods then that&#39;s a temporary story</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.430" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">what should serve the role that we that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.050" end="00:43:21.500" style="s2">mainstream thinks evolution serves</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:23.720" style="s2">what&#39;s a different theory or school or</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.500" end="00:43:26.870" style="s2">as it is it created it should be great</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.720" end="00:43:32.420" style="s2">like if we are gone beyond evolution how</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.870" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">do we so evolution is a process by which</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.420" end="00:43:38.270" style="s2">new things come to be that were not</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:40.550" style="s2">before tool-making or technology design</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.270" end="00:43:43.400" style="s2">as a process by which new things come to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.550" end="00:43:45.650" style="s2">be that weren&#39;t before the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.400" end="00:43:48.140" style="s2">relationship between those two self</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.650" end="00:43:51.110" style="s2">terminates at a certain point we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.140" end="00:43:52.670" style="s2">think about in a very general sense and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.110" end="00:43:54.230" style="s2">we could go deeper into this but in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.670" end="00:43:55.880" style="s2">general sense we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.230" end="00:43:57.890" style="s2">evolution as an unconscious process</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.880" end="00:43:59.720" style="s2">there&#39;s not like a central top-down</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.890" end="00:44:02.360" style="s2">mediated to here we want creatures like</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.720" end="00:44:04.490" style="s2">this there&#39;s mutation is an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.360" end="00:44:06.260" style="s2">process and then survival selection</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.490" end="00:44:09.350" style="s2">everybody wants to survive inmate</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.260" end="00:44:11.420" style="s2">selection right so but what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.350" end="00:44:13.460" style="s2">the the fact that mutation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.420" end="00:44:15.730" style="s2">distributed across the whole system and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.460" end="00:44:19.670" style="s2">the Selective pressures are Co selective</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.730" end="00:44:22.070" style="s2">creates a radically decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.670" end="00:44:24.170" style="s2">radically parallel type of process that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.070" end="00:44:26.420" style="s2">ends up being very slow most things fail</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.170" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">but what makes it through are highly</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.420" end="00:44:29.990" style="s2">interoperable increasing in order to</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:33.950" style="s2">complex it equal</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.990" end="00:44:35.420" style="s2">and tool-making so we can think of we</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.950" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">can think of evolution as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.420" end="00:44:42.740" style="s2">decentralized unconscious parallel</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:44.110" style="s2">process but that is actually tending to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.740" end="00:44:46.820" style="s2">the meta stability of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.110" end="00:44:48.890" style="s2">tool-making as a conscious process can</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.820" end="00:44:54.260" style="s2">happen in a single individual can happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.890" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">in or small groups can happen in serial</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.260" end="00:44:58.369" style="s2">not parallel someone can take insights</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:45:02.360" style="s2">and you know recursively work on those</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.369" end="00:45:04.670" style="s2">insights and it creates parts ready to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.360" end="00:45:06.470" style="s2">create up regulates one input variable</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.670" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">relative to others to be able to up</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.470" end="00:45:09.770" style="s2">regulate some output variables relative</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:13.700" style="s2">to others through the conscious ability</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.770" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">to understand that so there is a new</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.700" end="00:45:19.220" style="s2">third creative process so if we say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:22.070" style="s2">evolution is unconscious tending of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.220" end="00:45:23.660" style="s2">holes that obviously I&#39;m simplifying</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.070" end="00:45:25.820" style="s2">radically to make a construction here</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.660" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">and tool-making is conscious creation of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.820" end="00:45:29.390" style="s2">parts then there has to be a new process</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:32.300" style="s2">that is the conscious creation and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.390" end="00:45:34.430" style="s2">tending of holes and because if all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.300" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">the agents are acting like parts and up</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.430" end="00:45:39.770" style="s2">regulating their capacity but breaking</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:41.750" style="s2">the power symmetry that is where the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.770" end="00:45:43.490" style="s2">meta stability comes and not thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.750" end="00:45:45.950" style="s2">the long-term of the whole and it when</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.490" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">anyone deploys more asymmetrical power</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.950" end="00:45:50.510" style="s2">power everyone then ends up reverse</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:51.770" style="s2">engineering it also deploying it you get</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.510" end="00:45:53.210" style="s2">this exponential curve of power</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.770" end="00:45:56.030" style="s2">deployment all of which is driving</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.210" end="00:45:58.490" style="s2">entropy and driving externalization that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.030" end="00:46:00.500" style="s2">ends so as soon as we can affect the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.490" end="00:46:02.390" style="s2">whole that significantly there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.500" end="00:46:03.380" style="s2">conscious governance of how that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.390" end="00:46:06.590" style="s2">which is where there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.380" end="00:46:09.770" style="s2">large-scale sense-making and large scale</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.590" end="00:46:11.600" style="s2">values generation meaning thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.770" end="00:46:13.310" style="s2">what is good beyond just what wins and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.600" end="00:46:17.390" style="s2">rivals contexts and then large scale</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.310" end="00:46:19.100" style="s2">coordination capacity and so and this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.390" end="00:46:21.080" style="s2">where we start to talk about well how do</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.100" end="00:46:22.550" style="s2">we develop humans that can do that how</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.080" end="00:46:24.109" style="s2">do we develop relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.550" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">communication processes and protocols</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.109" end="00:46:29.030" style="s2">that work better at shared sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:30.710" style="s2">and shared values generation to inform</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.030" end="00:46:32.210" style="s2">better shared choice making where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.710" end="00:46:33.859" style="s2">actually have better capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.210" end="00:46:35.510" style="s2">coordinate than getting stuck in things</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.859" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">like perverse incentive and multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.510" end="00:46:40.280" style="s2">traps yeah this making a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:43.340" style="s2">one is as it makes sense to think of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.280" end="00:46:44.190" style="s2">humans as a means to an end in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.340" end="00:46:46.410" style="s2">some other</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.190" end="00:46:48.990" style="s2">being that has you know more powers than</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.410" end="00:46:50.730" style="s2">just like we you know we were some other</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.990" end="00:46:53.789" style="s2">being before us was it was means to to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.730" end="00:46:55.859" style="s2">us and does this resonate or the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.789" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">like global brain or the noosphere or</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.859" end="00:47:03.510" style="s2">like and how do you see that manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:06.660" style="s2">or or playing out do I think that we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.510" end="00:47:08.430" style="s2">part of the Hydra hydrocarbon bootloader</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.660" end="00:47:10.789" style="s2">process to make the advanced</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.430" end="00:47:13.349" style="s2">silica-based a eyes that then deplete</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.789" end="00:47:16.260" style="s2">replace all the hydrocarbons and are</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.349" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">better or that humans give rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.260" end="00:47:21.799" style="s2">trans humans and some sense in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:25.470" style="s2">how we technologically modify ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.799" end="00:47:28.349" style="s2">our physiological substrate both of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.470" end="00:47:31.349" style="s2">those sound pretty dystopic to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.349" end="00:47:33.510" style="s2">would very much like to make sure we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.349" end="00:47:36.569" style="s2">not heading down those trajectories I</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.510" end="00:47:39.690" style="s2">think that we it&#39;s kind of like you see</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.569" end="00:47:41.970" style="s2">a plant that has some traditional</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.690" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">recognized medicinal value and then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.970" end="00:47:46.619" style="s2">try to use scientific method to identify</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">the active ingredient extract that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.619" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">active ingredient potent eyes it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:53.069" style="s2">then give it as a drug and we&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:54.690" style="s2">attention to one thing that that herb</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.069" end="00:47:56.910" style="s2">supposedly did and we&#39;re measuring that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.690" end="00:47:59.279" style="s2">one thing that one metric and we say</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.910" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">look at this is a more powerful but</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.279" end="00:48:04.589" style="s2">there there&#39;s often also a process where</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:06.269" style="s2">now that more powerful thing might also</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.589" end="00:48:07.859" style="s2">cause side effects that the plan didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.269" end="00:48:09.869" style="s2">have there&#39;s externalities because there</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.859" end="00:48:12.359" style="s2">was a synergy of the way the molecules</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.869" end="00:48:13.730" style="s2">work together but it might also be that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.359" end="00:48:16.380" style="s2">there were a bunch of other things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.730" end="00:48:17.730" style="s2">were not the primary objective that were</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.380" end="00:48:21.690" style="s2">positive things that were happening that</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.730" end="00:48:24.660" style="s2">are now lost so oftentimes something</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.690" end="00:48:26.819" style="s2">makes it through whether its genetic or</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.660" end="00:48:28.529" style="s2">mimetic makes it through an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.819" end="00:48:30.930" style="s2">process that factors everything in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.529" end="00:48:33.059" style="s2">closed-loop way and then we try to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.930" end="00:48:35.579" style="s2">understand it by reducing it to some</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.059" end="00:48:37.890" style="s2">number of active metrics that we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.579" end="00:48:40.470" style="s2">then measure and optimize and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.890" end="00:48:41.700" style="s2">unknown unknown set the set of things</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.470" end="00:48:43.019" style="s2">that are relevant that we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.700" end="00:48:45.569" style="s2">know that we don&#39;t know that aren&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.019" end="00:48:49.319" style="s2">our model is more important than we</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.569" end="00:48:50.460" style="s2">account for most of the time and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.319" end="00:48:53.549" style="s2">I think that there is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.460" end="00:48:56.519" style="s2">information theoretic problem and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.549" end="00:48:57.690" style="s2">way we think about AI the way we think</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.519" end="00:49:01.670" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.690" end="00:49:04.200" style="s2">crisper and synthetic biology which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.670" end="00:49:07.710" style="s2">we will define what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.200" end="00:49:10.170" style="s2">achieve as good with one or two or five</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.710" end="00:49:12.059" style="s2">known metrics and we will seek to make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.170" end="00:49:15.059" style="s2">technology that has the first-order</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.059" end="00:49:16.470" style="s2">effect of increasing those metrics right</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.059" end="00:49:19.529" style="s2">the first-order effect meaning a direct</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.470" end="00:49:22.069" style="s2">effect and the calculation to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.529" end="00:49:25.220" style="s2">see a first-order effect on a known</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.069" end="00:49:28.349" style="s2">small set of metrics is relatively easy</p>

<p begin="00:51:44.490" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">questions one is you mentioned in a</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:53.070" style="s2">we have these false paradoxes between</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.060" end="00:51:54.870" style="s2">sort of or false you know false</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.870" end="00:51:59.610" style="s2">brain or are there others I&#39;m curious we</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.030" end="00:52:00.930" style="s2">unpack that a little bit wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.610" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">where it comes from or why it&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.930" end="00:52:04.590" style="s2">and then mention if we think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:07.470" style="s2">science is one tool in the toolkit is</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.590" end="00:52:08.610" style="s2">there what&#39;s another important tool how</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.470" end="00:52:10.860" style="s2">do you think about that that&#39;s woke up</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.610" end="00:52:13.250" style="s2">broadly in terms of you good choice</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.860" end="00:52:16.260" style="s2">making and then maybe this is related to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.250" end="00:52:18.270" style="s2">and I know this is a huge topic so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.260" end="00:52:19.950" style="s2">a little bit of an injustice to just</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.270" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">shrink it to a minute but if you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.950" end="00:52:25.530" style="s2">sort of write the crux of what you find</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:27.090" style="s2">really interesting about forest Landers</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.530" end="00:52:33.030" style="s2">work or what you think is contribution</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.090" end="00:52:42.180" style="s2">is I accept that&#39;s related yeah in terms</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.030" end="00:52:47.010" style="s2">of the need to have a ethical system</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.180" end="00:52:48.930" style="s2">that is commensurable that is able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.010" end="00:52:53.360" style="s2">have logical congruence with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.930" end="00:52:55.260" style="s2">philosophy of science so that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.360" end="00:52:57.420" style="s2">philosophy that gives rise to our</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.260" end="00:52:59.970" style="s2">ability to make more powerful choices is</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.420" end="00:53:02.610" style="s2">also connected to the ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.970" end="00:53:04.980" style="s2">better choices working towards that in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.610" end="00:53:08.820" style="s2">meaningful way is one of the areas that</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.980" end="00:53:11.190" style="s2">forests work has been that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.820" end="00:53:12.870" style="s2">most meaningful of a contribution</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.190" end="00:53:16.380" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of things I think a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.870" end="00:53:18.510" style="s2">meaningful contribution and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.380" end="00:53:20.100" style="s2">again we said the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.510" end="00:53:21.690" style="s2">looks at the domain of the measurable</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.100" end="00:53:24.510" style="s2">and repeatable or we can say the domain</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.690" end="00:53:25.809" style="s2">of measurable repeatable specifically</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.510" end="00:53:30.009" style="s2">which is always going to be third</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.809" end="00:53:32.680" style="s2">and so there are some philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.009" end="00:53:35.319" style="s2">assumptions about what third-person</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.680" end="00:53:36.969" style="s2">means what first-person means and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.319" end="00:53:39.430" style="s2">the relationship between first and third</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.969" end="00:53:41.559" style="s2">person are or reifying what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.430" end="00:53:42.969" style="s2">subjective what we mean by objective and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.559" end="00:53:46.599" style="s2">what the relationship between subjective</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.969" end="00:53:49.959" style="s2">and objective are that forests work</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.599" end="00:53:53.130" style="s2">starts at that level and the reification</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.959" end="00:53:55.449" style="s2">gives the basis to then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.130" end="00:53:57.039" style="s2">ground the philosophy of science and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.449" end="00:53:58.329" style="s2">something deeper than it like well</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.039" end="00:53:59.979" style="s2">obviously if we&#39;re looking at the domain</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.329" end="00:54:01.420" style="s2">of measurable and repeatable we we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.979" end="00:54:03.449" style="s2">to start with measurable and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.420" end="00:54:05.829" style="s2">measurement always involves a measure or</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.449" end="00:54:07.569" style="s2">measuring some measured there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.829" end="00:54:09.549" style="s2">triplicate relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.569" end="00:54:12.759" style="s2">observed the process of observation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.549" end="00:54:16.900" style="s2">the observer and yet then what we try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.759" end="00:54:18.759" style="s2">do is take for the most part the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.900" end="00:54:21.880" style="s2">measurement process and especially the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.759" end="00:54:25.739" style="s2">measure for granted and create an</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.880" end="00:54:28.269" style="s2">ontology of measures even though the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.739" end="00:54:31.380" style="s2">fundamental basis of the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.269" end="00:54:33.969" style="s2">measurement itself isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.380" end="00:54:35.619" style="s2">semantically frame abaut in a logical</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.969" end="00:54:38.920" style="s2">way without those three concepts being</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.619" end="00:54:41.619" style="s2">bound so it&#39;s very interesting if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.920" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">look at kind of vedanta kai deal ism or</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.619" end="00:54:44.949" style="s2">buddhist idealism or solipsism in</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:46.809" style="s2">general on one side and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.949" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">physicalism on the other side i would</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.809" end="00:54:53.279" style="s2">say that they make the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:57.069" style="s2">reductive mistake so physicalism says</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.279" end="00:55:00.400" style="s2">that objective or physical is</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.069" end="00:55:03.130" style="s2">fundamentally real and subjective is</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.400" end="00:55:06.459" style="s2">either not real like it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.130" end="00:55:10.239" style="s2">illusion all uh you know radical limit</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.459" end="00:55:14.380" style="s2">of ism or it&#39;s an epiphenomena it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.239" end="00:55:16.179" style="s2">you know secondary and they have a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.380" end="00:55:18.989" style="s2">compelling argument for that right the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.179" end="00:55:22.299" style="s2">compelling argument is it requires</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.989" end="00:55:23.979" style="s2">assuming a bunch of things as more</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.299" end="00:55:28.809" style="s2">epistemic ly grounded than I think they</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.979" end="00:55:31.029" style="s2">are but so BIGBANG just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.809" end="00:55:32.499" style="s2">plasma and then particles and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.029" end="00:55:34.199" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s anything we</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.499" end="00:55:37.499" style="s2">can call consciousness and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.199" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">eventually planets at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.499" end="00:55:42.220" style="s2">hydrological biological process</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:43.990" style="s2">protocells whatever it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.220" end="00:55:45.940" style="s2">think about consciousness before that so</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.990" end="00:55:47.560" style="s2">it seems like there was physical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.940" end="00:55:49.210" style="s2">before there was consciousness stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.560" end="00:55:52.840" style="s2">then consciousness must have emerged out</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.210" end="00:55:54.430" style="s2">of there and if people can describe</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.840" end="00:55:56.470" style="s2">their subjective experience while hooked</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.430" end="00:55:57.820" style="s2">up to an EEG or an fMRI and we can look</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.470" end="00:55:59.170" style="s2">at their brain and we can see some type</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.820" end="00:56:00.880" style="s2">of statistical correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.170" end="00:56:02.620" style="s2">patterns of brain and their subjective</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.880" end="00:56:04.210" style="s2">experience and we can say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.620" end="00:56:05.890" style="s2">correlation between subjective and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.210" end="00:56:08.080" style="s2">objective but we think that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.890" end="00:56:10.320" style="s2">objective is controlled by the objective</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.080" end="00:56:13.270" style="s2">ie that physics is causally closed</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.320" end="00:56:14.650" style="s2">therefore your brain state this moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.270" end="00:56:18.460" style="s2">as the result of your brain state a</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.650" end="00:56:21.540" style="s2">moment ago and the particle physics that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.460" end="00:56:23.530" style="s2">governs you know ion differentials of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.540" end="00:56:25.990" style="s2">what&#39;s going to actually happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.530" end="00:56:28.300" style="s2">brain in relationship with the body in</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.990" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">the environment so if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.300" end="00:56:33.340" style="s2">one-for-one correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:35.140" style="s2">described subjective States and observed</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.340" end="00:56:36.670" style="s2">objective States and the objective</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.140" end="00:56:38.770" style="s2">states are the result of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.670" end="00:56:42.850" style="s2">causation and this closure over that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.770" end="00:56:45.490" style="s2">then subjectivity must be a a causal</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.850" end="00:56:47.770" style="s2">epiphenomena right like there&#39;s various</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.490" end="00:56:51.070" style="s2">versions of that argument and as you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.770" end="00:56:53.980" style="s2">see you know argument between Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.070" end="00:56:57.070" style="s2">and M Dan Dennett who both would</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.980" end="00:56:58.660" style="s2">typically think of themselves as being</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.070" end="00:57:01.390" style="s2">mostly informed by the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.660" end="00:57:03.640" style="s2">science come to you know Dan Dennett</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.390" end="00:57:05.830" style="s2">says that consciousness is not real but</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.640" end="00:57:08.800" style="s2">free will is and Sam says free will is</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.830" end="00:57:11.410" style="s2">not real but consciousness is and at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.800" end="00:57:13.030" style="s2">end of their argument Sam said something</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.410" end="00:57:14.620" style="s2">like it appears we have fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.030" end="00:57:16.120" style="s2">different intuitions on this which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.620" end="00:57:19.000" style="s2">actually very important which meant that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.120" end="00:57:20.830" style="s2">the symbol grounding was actually the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.000" end="00:57:22.600" style="s2">the key thing and this is where you get</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.830" end="00:57:24.660" style="s2">tarce Keys theorem you know coming out</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.600" end="00:57:27.670" style="s2">of girdle&#39;s theorem which is that any</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.660" end="00:57:29.290" style="s2">formal logical system involves ideas</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.670" end="00:57:32.110" style="s2">that cannot be reified in that system</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.290" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">and that means that there is no logical</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.110" end="00:57:37.930" style="s2">system that is consistent that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:40.120" style="s2">complete and I now this comes back to I</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.930" end="00:57:41.860" style="s2">said there is no perfect social system</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.120" end="00:57:43.660" style="s2">and it comes back to why the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.860" end="00:57:45.730" style="s2">Lao Tzu said when he wrote this book is</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.660" end="00:57:48.820" style="s2">that the DAO that is nameable as eternal</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.730" end="00:57:50.450" style="s2">Dao is the formal system that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.820" end="00:57:54.440" style="s2">complete</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.450" end="00:57:59.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist right okay so we can see</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.440" end="00:58:01.100" style="s2">how basically philosophy of science is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.180" end="00:58:02.600" style="s2">and obviously I&#39;m radically</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.100" end="00:58:06.080" style="s2">oversimplifying to go quickly and we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.600" end="00:58:08.360" style="s2">do the nuance thing at some point so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.080" end="00:58:09.740" style="s2">question what is real philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.360" end="00:58:11.480" style="s2">science says well the stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.740" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">measurable and repeatable seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.480" end="00:58:14.900" style="s2">pretty clearly real because we might</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:16.580" style="s2">think that sound is faster than light</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.900" end="00:58:19.330" style="s2">but we can all measure that it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.580" end="00:58:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the same every time and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.330" end="00:58:24.140" style="s2">congruence of objectivity and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:25.820" style="s2">repeatability of it and its independence</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.140" end="00:58:28.430" style="s2">to our beliefs about it seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.820" end="00:58:29.780" style="s2">good basis for real and then the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.430" end="00:58:31.490" style="s2">that we can make predictions with it and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.780" end="00:58:34.340" style="s2">make out of it and that works and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.490" end="00:58:38.060" style="s2">whatever and so then of course you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.340" end="00:58:40.250" style="s2">an epistemology which is measuring and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.060" end="00:58:42.770" style="s2">repeating and then testing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.250" end="00:58:45.290" style="s2">like that which is given epistemology of</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.770" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">third person that is the epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.290" end="00:58:48.860" style="s2">that makes sense starting with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:50.300" style="s2">oncologic assumption that what is real</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.860" end="00:58:52.940" style="s2">is the stuff that you can assess me</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.300" end="00:58:55.070" style="s2">about epistemology and so then you do a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.940" end="00:58:56.900" style="s2">bunch of third-person assessment and all</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.070" end="00:58:58.790" style="s2">you find is causation and third-person</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.900" end="00:59:01.040" style="s2">and so of course you end up then coming</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.790" end="00:59:02.120" style="s2">to what is real is third-person stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.040" end="00:59:05.000" style="s2">because your whole process has been</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.120" end="00:59:06.710" style="s2">measurements on third-person stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.000" end="00:59:09.170" style="s2">there&#39;s an ontological assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.710" end="00:59:10.190" style="s2">creates an inappropriate epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.170" end="00:59:12.320" style="s2">that then proves the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.190" end="00:59:13.730" style="s2">assumption so then they don tor Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.320" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">did the exact same thing on the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.730" end="00:59:18.650" style="s2">side they say that subjectivity is</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:23.300" style="s2">fundamental and objectivity is either an</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.650" end="00:59:25.220" style="s2">illusion or Maya you know etc or in</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.300" end="00:59:27.350" style="s2">epiphenomena the structures arising</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.220" end="00:59:29.480" style="s2">within consciousness and they argue it</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.350" end="00:59:31.400" style="s2">in a very similar kind of way on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.480" end="00:59:33.950" style="s2">opposite they say well I don&#39;t really I</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.400" end="00:59:35.600" style="s2">can&#39;t prove that I&#39;m not dreaming or in</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.950" end="00:59:37.070" style="s2">a hallucination or anything else so my</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.600" end="00:59:39.320" style="s2">measurements might all be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.070" end="00:59:41.510" style="s2">dream and you and the repeatability of</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.320" end="00:59:44.720" style="s2">it is all part of my dream so I have</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.510" end="00:59:46.430" style="s2">less epistemic ground on the objective</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.720" end="00:59:48.320" style="s2">stuff out here than I have on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.430" end="00:59:49.430" style="s2">that there is an experience arising that</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.320" end="00:59:51.170" style="s2">I&#39;m actually experiencing something</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.430" end="00:59:54.050" style="s2">they&#39;ve Hart said something obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.170" end="00:59:57.410" style="s2">very similar to this and so what I have</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.050" end="00:59:59.930" style="s2">the most epistemic grounding on is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.410" end="01:00:02.180" style="s2">experience is occurring but my</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.930" end="01:00:03.500" style="s2">perception of myself as experience or</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.180" end="01:00:05.000" style="s2">might be an illusion</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.500" end="01:00:06.470" style="s2">is a self here but it might be different</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.000" end="01:00:07.970" style="s2">than I think it is and there&#39;s a world</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.470" end="01:00:11.240" style="s2">but it might be different than I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.970" end="01:00:13.130" style="s2">it is so there is some self experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.240" end="01:00:15.620" style="s2">a world experience or experiencing and</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.130" end="01:00:17.090" style="s2">experienced that they the experienced</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.620" end="01:00:20.360" style="s2">and the experienced or might have</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.090" end="01:00:25.220" style="s2">delusion but the experience is prima</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.360" end="01:00:27.500" style="s2">facie occurring so what I can what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.220" end="01:00:28.850" style="s2">real is that which can be experienced as</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.500" end="01:00:31.390" style="s2">opposed to measured and repeated</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.850" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">therefore I have an epistemology of</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.390" end="01:00:35.570" style="s2">inquiry and noticing the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:37.400" style="s2">experience and running experiments in</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.570" end="01:00:38.330" style="s2">there of moving attention in certain</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.400" end="01:00:39.980" style="s2">ways and seeing what happens with</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.330" end="01:00:43.010" style="s2">experience and so I get a</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.980" end="01:00:45.350" style="s2">phenomenological epistemology and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.010" end="01:00:47.000" style="s2">that ends up confirming see everything</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.350" end="01:00:49.100" style="s2">that I noticed is experience and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.000" end="01:00:51.410" style="s2">everything that is objective is a riot I</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.100" end="01:00:53.060" style="s2">can only say even exists because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.410" end="01:00:54.170" style="s2">experiencing it if I couldn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.060" end="01:00:55.730" style="s2">experience the measurement the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.170" end="01:00:57.020" style="s2">measurement wouldn&#39;t have occurred this</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.730" end="01:01:00.020" style="s2">is the if the tree falls in the forest</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.020" end="01:01:02.030" style="s2">and there&#39;s no one there to hear so I</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.020" end="01:01:05.240" style="s2">would say that they both basically made</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.030" end="01:01:07.820" style="s2">an oncological that then created an</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.240" end="01:01:09.650" style="s2">epistemology that then confirmed the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.820" end="01:01:10.850" style="s2">oncologic assumption in East is East and</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.650" end="01:01:11.180" style="s2">West is West and never the twain shall</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.850" end="01:01:15.110" style="s2">meet</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.180" end="01:01:16.490" style="s2">and then of course Silicon Valley and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.110" end="01:01:20.420" style="s2">whatever we do this very funny thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.490" end="01:01:22.130" style="s2">like take principles of Buddhism to do a</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.420" end="01:01:24.380" style="s2">mindfulness practice to crush the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.130" end="01:01:28.490" style="s2">competition more effectively which is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.380" end="01:01:32.030" style="s2">very funny strange hybrid of kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.490" end="01:01:35.060" style="s2">game theoretic versions of both but</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.030" end="01:01:37.910" style="s2">underneath the experience so ok</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.060" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">the vedantist will walk you through a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.910" end="01:01:41.990" style="s2">process and say notice the tree now</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:43.820" style="s2">notice that you want the tree you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.990" end="01:01:45.320" style="s2">one noticing the tree ok so notice some</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.820" end="01:01:46.610" style="s2">other objects notice that you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.320" end="01:01:47.870" style="s2">those objects you&#39;re the one noticing</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.610" end="01:01:50.180" style="s2">the objects now notice your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.870" end="01:01:52.280" style="s2">those thoughts are objects objects of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.180" end="01:01:53.930" style="s2">attention so notice that you you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.280" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">hold an image of the tree in your mind</p>

<p begin="01:04:54.950" end="01:05:01.190" style="s2">the claim and it was interesting for me</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.490" end="01:05:03.320" style="s2">when I first looked at it and I had you</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.190" end="01:05:04.550" style="s2">know decent background in both science</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.320" end="01:05:07.550" style="s2">and the philosophy of science and</p>

<p begin="01:05:09.140" end="01:05:13.580" style="s2">had done things that were maybe closest</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.060" end="01:05:15.860" style="s2">in that direction it really just looked</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.580" end="01:05:19.400" style="s2">like gibberish when you read the axioms</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.860" end="01:05:20.960" style="s2">and modalities it is hard for it to make</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.400" end="01:05:25.250" style="s2">any sense and it also seemed kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.960" end="01:05:27.350" style="s2">like impenetrable gibberish so if I only</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.250" end="01:05:29.450" style="s2">got the book I would have definitely not</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.350" end="01:05:31.010" style="s2">done much with it after the first half</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.450" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">an hour and then gave up it was only</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.010" end="01:05:34.730" style="s2">because I got to spend a decent bit of</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:38.270" style="s2">time with Forrest and he was able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.730" end="01:05:40.310" style="s2">actually show me the application of it</p>

<p begin="01:05:40.310" end="01:05:45.920" style="s2">I knew well that I&#39;m like oh that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.360" end="01:05:47.870" style="s2">actually a novel insight in the</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.870" end="01:05:51.050" style="s2">and that that happened across enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.460" end="01:05:52.430" style="s2">spaces that I gave the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.050" end="01:05:55.610" style="s2">doubt to say oh there&#39;s actually an</p>

<p begin="01:05:58.070" end="01:06:03.020" style="s2">domain knowledge so then the long haul</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.920" end="01:06:06.860" style="s2">of working to understand it came in and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.020" end="01:06:09.290" style="s2">I will say that it&#39;s been extremely</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.860" end="01:06:11.390" style="s2">helpful in being able to take other</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.290" end="01:06:13.010" style="s2">epistemologies like evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.390" end="01:06:15.320" style="s2">or complexity science or mathematics or</p>

<p begin="01:08:21.330" end="01:08:26.430" style="s2">back to that no consistent system will</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.490" end="01:08:28.200" style="s2">be complete and when you even look at</p>

<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:21.190" style="s2">its behavior perfectly there&#39;s some</p>

<p begin="01:10:36.730" end="01:10:39.909" style="s2">doesn&#39;t follow the model perfectly so it</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.260" end="01:10:41.080" style="s2">has some benefit and then some up</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.909" end="01:10:43.270" style="s2">things right so then we try to make a</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.080" end="01:10:46.949" style="s2">slightly more complicated model so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.270" end="01:10:49.780" style="s2">no false idols is that the model of</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.949" end="01:10:52.710" style="s2">reality is never reality so don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.780" end="01:10:55.090" style="s2">get too attached to it don&#39;t ever get</p>

<p begin="01:11:06.610" end="01:11:10.690" style="s2">so there is a reverence for reality that</p>

<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:19.330" style="s2">making better models while not being</p>

<p begin="01:11:25.660" end="01:11:32.190" style="s2">much better models and then a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.580" end="01:11:35.590" style="s2">years from then again right so religion</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.190" end="01:11:38.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve been reading the founding fathers</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.590" end="01:11:39.790" style="s2">of this country letters to each other a</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.020" end="01:11:43.120" style="s2">lot lately as I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.790" end="01:11:46.420" style="s2">public education and the need for just</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.120" end="01:11:49.410" style="s2">an almost mind-blowing an increase in</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.420" end="01:11:51.580" style="s2">what we would call public education and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.410" end="01:11:53.020" style="s2">one of the things they spoke to again</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.580" end="01:11:55.210" style="s2">again we can think this is an antiquated</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.020" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">idea of a bunch of like old white dudes</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.210" end="01:11:59.260" style="s2">in a time where science had in advance</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:01.930" style="s2">enough and I really think that that is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.260" end="01:12:06.420" style="s2">mistaken assessment they talked about</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.930" end="01:12:11.500" style="s2">the need for a religious education as</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.420" end="01:12:13.330" style="s2">being as critical as a education in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.500" end="01:12:15.610" style="s2">sciences and technology and trades and</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.330" end="01:12:16.960" style="s2">etc and some of them said things like I</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.610" end="01:12:20.710" style="s2">actually don&#39;t care if they&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.960" end="01:12:22.390" style="s2">Confucius or Rumi or you know whatever</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.710" end="01:12:24.940" style="s2">it&#39;s that there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.390" end="01:12:28.150" style="s2">transcendental operator there needs to</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.940" end="01:12:29.680" style="s2">be that whatever our current model is we</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.150" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">need to be able to have at least some</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.680" end="01:12:34.300" style="s2">frames for an intuitive connection to</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:35.680" style="s2">something that is beyond the limit of</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.300" end="01:12:37.690" style="s2">those frames and so this is where I</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.680" end="01:12:39.010" style="s2">would say that you know utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.690" end="01:12:41.320" style="s2">ethics is necessary but not sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.010" end="01:12:44.440" style="s2">virtue ethics also serves a role because</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.320" end="01:12:46.420" style="s2">in utilitarian ethics first if I take</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.440" end="01:12:48.430" style="s2">negative utilitarianism I want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.420" end="01:12:49.840" style="s2">minimize suffering then obviously the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.430" end="01:12:52.210" style="s2">best way to do that is to just kill the</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.840" end="01:12:54.219" style="s2">universe and I&#39;ll have the least area</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.210" end="01:12:56.410" style="s2">under the curve of suffering into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.219" end="01:13:00.610" style="s2">future we can see that every one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.410" end="01:13:02.770" style="s2">utilitarian series if hypotheses if I do</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.610" end="01:13:04.930" style="s2">a reductio ad absurdum I can see that it</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.770" end="01:13:06.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually further and this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.930" end="01:13:08.739" style="s2">again one of these partial</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.760" end="01:13:12.810" style="s2">considerations of something more complex</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.739" end="01:13:17.699" style="s2">than the model can hold and so in</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.810" end="01:13:20.440" style="s2">utilitarian calculus I have to assume</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.699" end="01:13:22.090" style="s2">higher degree of epistemic certainty</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.440" end="01:13:24.429" style="s2">than I usually have when actually making</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.090" end="01:13:26.380" style="s2">choice right because often time</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.429" end="01:13:28.599" style="s2">I&#39;m making a choice in not only the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.380" end="01:13:31.840" style="s2">complex domain but the anthro complex</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.599" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">domain the domain of humans interacting</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.840" end="01:13:34.989" style="s2">with lots of humans interacting with</p>

<p begin="01:13:34.989" end="01:13:39.519" style="s2">technological systems and so what I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.900" end="01:13:41.469" style="s2">end up doing is say ok the things that</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.519" end="01:13:43.059" style="s2">matter are these things and the effect</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.469" end="01:13:46.059" style="s2">of this action is going to be this and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.059" end="01:13:47.860" style="s2">so I&#39;m willing to have the ends justify</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.059" end="01:13:50.530" style="s2">the means and I&#39;ll sacrifice some harm</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.860" end="01:13:53.170" style="s2">here for some greater good here but so</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.530" end="01:13:54.670" style="s2">often I cannot actually say that that</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.170" end="01:13:56.349" style="s2">will be the greater good that in terms</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.670" end="01:13:57.789" style="s2">of the effect of the action that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.349" end="01:13:59.739" style="s2">harm will be limited in that way that</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.789" end="01:14:02.019" style="s2">the benefits will be that because the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.739" end="01:14:03.670" style="s2">unknown unknown set is so large now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.019" end="01:14:06.010" style="s2">not doing a god of the gaps argument I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.670" end="01:14:09.459" style="s2">saying simply we can&#39;t predict the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.010" end="01:14:10.869" style="s2">weather 10 days out and so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.459" end="01:14:15.400" style="s2">place where people start to look at</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.869" end="01:14:17.619" style="s2">virtue ethics is ok be where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.400" end="01:14:19.389" style="s2">have the epistemic certainty to just run</p>

<p begin="01:14:19.389" end="01:14:24.010" style="s2">of metrics is there something that</p>

<p begin="01:14:25.659" end="01:14:29.320" style="s2">greater integrity and we can say that</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.139" end="01:14:51.459" style="s2">know religions were obviously like there</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.900" end="01:14:53.170" style="s2">were philosophers who were wise people</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.519" end="01:15:21.939" style="s2">and I would neither want to have to keep</p>

<p begin="01:16:52.920" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">forward and I think we could look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.889" end="01:16:59.940" style="s2">this in a way that would both clarify</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:01.710" style="s2">and reify previous religions into</p>

<p begin="01:17:33.750" end="01:17:36.840" style="s2">you resonate with her as you see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.130" end="01:17:38.849" style="s2">like differently there&#39;s not not the</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.840" end="01:17:41.639" style="s2">right way to think about I think we have</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.849" end="01:17:43.020" style="s2">to be very careful here because you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.639" end="01:17:45.500" style="s2">we can make the Bertrand Russell</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.020" end="01:17:49.349" style="s2">argument very quickly against them that</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.500" end="01:17:51.119" style="s2">believing nonsense because it seems to</p>

<p begin="01:17:51.119" end="01:17:56.309" style="s2">or have some pragmatic or utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.669" end="01:18:00.030" style="s2">purpose is not a reasonable thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.309" end="01:18:03.149" style="s2">because if it&#39;s not true it&#39;ll end up</p>

<p begin="01:18:08.459" end="01:18:13.439" style="s2">territory in the process so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.829" end="01:18:17.610" style="s2">think it&#39;s that we want to indulge</p>

<p begin="01:18:17.610" end="01:18:23.219" style="s2">comforting I think it&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.769" end="01:18:26.219" style="s2">recognize that the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.219" end="01:18:30.419" style="s2">and utilitarianism do not give us access</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.219" end="01:18:32.879" style="s2">to all of the true and so then we have</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.419" end="01:18:34.949" style="s2">to say what is an expanded epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.879" end="01:18:36.449" style="s2">for the domain of the real not just the</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.949" end="01:18:39.389" style="s2">domain of the repeatable and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.449" end="01:18:41.189" style="s2">objective so in the same way that and</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.389" end="01:18:44.099" style="s2">you know then people very quickly say</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.189" end="01:18:47.369" style="s2">well intuition is just pretty obviously</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.099" end="01:18:50.010" style="s2">corrupted by desires and fears and love</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.369" end="01:18:52.379" style="s2">Oh rationality is obviously corrupted</p>

<p begin="01:18:52.379" end="01:18:56.399" style="s2">is actually what formal logic and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.360" end="01:18:58.679" style="s2">mathematics and critical thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.399" end="01:19:00.209" style="s2">you know all of the domains of learning</p>

<p begin="01:19:00.209" end="01:19:03.119" style="s2">because we&#39;ve all heard people make</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.469" end="01:19:05.550" style="s2">rational arguments that are just utterly</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.119" end="01:19:08.519" style="s2">gibberish because of lots of rational</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.550" end="01:19:11.969" style="s2">mistakes logical fallacies whatever you</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.519" end="01:19:14.669" style="s2">have to train intuition as well and if</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.969" end="01:19:16.619" style="s2">you look at what narcissists and</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.669" end="01:19:18.079" style="s2">sociopaths will do in gaslighting that</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.619" end="01:19:20.489" style="s2">will end up other people up</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.079" end="01:19:22.439" style="s2">gaslighting is usually making a rational</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.439" end="01:19:26.369" style="s2">believe that gets them to override their</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.939" end="01:19:27.809" style="s2">intuition and so someone&#39;s like man</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.369" end="01:19:29.429" style="s2">something feels wrong with this</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.809" end="01:19:30.360" style="s2">person feels like they&#39;re not being</p>

<p begin="01:19:30.360" end="01:19:33.449" style="s2">person makes the argument well enough</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.280" end="01:19:34.709" style="s2">and they&#39;re like okay well I want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.449" end="01:19:36.719" style="s2">give the benefit of the doubt I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.709" end="01:19:37.679" style="s2">want whatever it is and so and then they</p>

<p begin="01:19:41.340" end="01:19:47.959" style="s2">a way that we can use a rationalist</p>

<p begin="01:19:52.349" end="01:19:56.280" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know how to do the</p>

<p begin="01:20:03.190" end="01:20:08.140" style="s2">to smuggle in gibberish but then</p>

<p begin="01:22:23.090" end="01:22:26.690" style="s2">like terrible everywhere because you</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.490" end="01:22:28.420" style="s2">know involved things like well the</p>

<p begin="01:22:33.320" end="01:22:37.690" style="s2">that will end up supporting me</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.970" end="01:22:40.760" style="s2">Amazon therefore we&#39;re making this</p>

<p begin="01:22:43.910" end="01:22:48.590" style="s2">of it and be able to provide you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.490" end="01:22:50.450" style="s2">economic well benefit to those acres</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.590" end="01:22:52.490" style="s2">associate and like okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.450" end="01:22:56.000" style="s2">so right now the indigenous people do</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.490" end="01:22:57.980" style="s2">like a thousand things and making just</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.000" end="01:23:01.340" style="s2">the amount of crafts that they need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.980" end="01:23:03.620" style="s2">live is one of the things that they do</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.340" end="01:23:05.720" style="s2">now as soon as you start providing</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.620" end="01:23:07.100" style="s2">economic advantage and survival to doing</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.720" end="01:23:08.420" style="s2">that one thing and not all the other</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.100" end="01:23:09.620" style="s2">things and you just convert the</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.420" end="01:23:11.720" style="s2">indigenous people to a Chinese sweatshop</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.620" end="01:23:13.190" style="s2">where now everyone just does the artisan</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.720" end="01:23:14.690" style="s2">crafts all of the time and they try and</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.190" end="01:23:15.890" style="s2">bring in more people to do that thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.690" end="01:23:18.650" style="s2">and like if you want to know how to</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.890" end="01:23:21.250" style="s2">destroy an indigenous culture figure out</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.650" end="01:23:23.720" style="s2">how to monetize one part of it heavily</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.250" end="01:23:25.040" style="s2">independent of any kind of value on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.720" end="01:23:27.290" style="s2">other things and this is where we talked</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.040" end="01:23:28.820" style="s2">about values that are extractable and</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.290" end="01:23:30.140" style="s2">exchangeable compared to things that are</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.820" end="01:23:32.000" style="s2">valuable but aren&#39;t extractable and</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.140" end="01:23:33.380" style="s2">exchangeable so it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.000" end="01:23:35.660" style="s2">really think through those strategies</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.380" end="01:23:37.850" style="s2">and say is this going to be an the right</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.660" end="01:23:41.770" style="s2">way to do it and when you start to</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.850" end="01:23:44.300" style="s2">monetize one of the parts that is</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.770" end="01:23:45.800" style="s2">extractable and exchangeable and not all</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.300" end="01:23:47.120" style="s2">the other ones and you confer a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.800" end="01:23:49.010" style="s2">advantage in doing that then obviously</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.120" end="01:23:50.870" style="s2">you start to bias the entire culture</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.010" end="01:23:54.590" style="s2">towards doing that particular thing and</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.870" end="01:23:56.150" style="s2">you lose key other parts so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.590" end="01:23:59.060" style="s2">just as someone has to say will this be</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.150" end="01:24:00.440" style="s2">net positive and in a false dichotomy</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.060" end="01:24:01.700" style="s2">that says well if we don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.440" end="01:24:02.810" style="s2">they&#39;re all burned and slaughtered but</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.700" end="01:24:05.690" style="s2">you have to say are there better</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.810" end="01:24:07.700" style="s2">strategies so this action important</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.690" end="01:24:10.670" style="s2">topic the rationalist community has this</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.700" end="01:24:15.160" style="s2">you know ongoing debate in certain areas</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.670" end="01:24:17.450" style="s2">on mistake theory versus conflict theory</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.160" end="01:24:21.440" style="s2">Michael Vassar turned me on to this</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.450" end="01:24:24.140" style="s2">thinking and there&#39;s this question of do</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.440" end="01:24:25.580" style="s2">we do the dumb things because of a</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.140" end="01:24:26.750" style="s2">mistake theory meaning there was just no</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.580" end="01:24:29.540" style="s2">way we could have predicted that</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.750" end="01:24:32.000" style="s2">externality which is too hard oh</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.540" end="01:24:34.340" style="s2">or conflict theory which was we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.000" end="01:24:36.530" style="s2">really try to predict the externality or</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.340" end="01:24:40.820" style="s2">the problem or we even wanted to cause</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.530" end="01:24:42.890" style="s2">it and while both are true one of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.820" end="01:24:44.570" style="s2">things we have to factor is that mistake</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.890" end="01:24:46.550" style="s2">Theory ends up being a source of</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.570" end="01:24:50.270" style="s2">plausible deniability for conflict</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.550" end="01:24:52.340" style="s2">theory so there are heaps of places</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.270" end="01:24:54.500" style="s2">where we are actually doing something</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.340" end="01:24:57.110" style="s2">that we know is going to cause harm and</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.500" end="01:24:59.930" style="s2">whether it&#39;s PNG not fixing their things</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.110" end="01:25:01.970" style="s2">or the deep shore thing you know not</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.930" end="01:25:03.230" style="s2">fixing its oil rigging or the whatever</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.970" end="01:25:06.080" style="s2">like we know something&#39;s gonna cause a</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.230" end="01:25:07.400" style="s2">problem or we don&#39;t know it is but we</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.080" end="01:25:08.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t really try to do good safety</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.400" end="01:25:10.670" style="s2">analysis either because that would have</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.750" end="01:25:11.810" style="s2">been expensive and then after the fact</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.670" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">we say there&#39;s no way we could have</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.810" end="01:25:16.460" style="s2">known so we&#39;ll end up using complexity</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:18.410" style="s2">and mistake theory as a source of</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.460" end="01:25:24.110" style="s2">plausible deniability for being assholes</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.410" end="01:25:25.790" style="s2">and so we have to be very careful not to</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.110" end="01:25:28.130" style="s2">do that so oftentimes we&#39;ll look at a</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.790" end="01:25:29.900" style="s2">strategy and make a very false</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.130" end="01:25:31.700" style="s2">comparison and say well either we do</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.900" end="01:25:33.020" style="s2">this or don&#39;t do this and if we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.700" end="01:25:34.460" style="s2">it great tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.020" end="01:25:37.280" style="s2">so we strawman all the other</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.460" end="01:25:39.380" style="s2">possibilities to then support why ours</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.280" end="01:25:40.790" style="s2">is utilitarian the best as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.380" end="01:25:43.340" style="s2">really try to think are there better</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.790" end="01:25:44.990" style="s2">strategies and probably there are much</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.340" end="01:25:46.400" style="s2">better strategies but maybe they take</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.990" end="01:25:48.830" style="s2">more thinking and don&#39;t provide as much</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.400" end="01:25:52.310" style="s2">immediate capitalisation for me so again</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.830" end="01:25:54.470" style="s2">there is no answer other than really</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.310" end="01:25:56.840" style="s2">deep earnestness of what you actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.470" end="01:25:59.390" style="s2">care about okay so the reason I brought</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.840" end="01:26:02.180" style="s2">that up is to say are there things that</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.390" end="01:26:04.250" style="s2">are advertised as transitional or game B</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.180" end="01:26:06.680" style="s2">or vectoring in the right direction that</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.250" end="01:26:08.780" style="s2">really should not be considered that yes</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.680" end="01:26:10.640" style="s2">so one has to really do the thoughtful</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.780" end="01:26:13.580" style="s2">sense making if they actually care about</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.640" end="01:26:17.720" style="s2">the direction things are really oriented</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.580" end="01:26:19.670" style="s2">you know attention economy what could be</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.720" end="01:26:23.240" style="s2">done there I haven&#39;t done a thorough</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.670" end="01:26:26.680" style="s2">enough analysis to be able to make false</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.240" end="01:26:29.960" style="s2">suggestions and say that when we run the</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.680" end="01:26:31.490" style="s2">run all of the try and as best we can</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.960" end="01:26:33.050" style="s2">second third order effects that this</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.490" end="01:26:35.000" style="s2">would be the right thing to do but we</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.050" end="01:26:37.870" style="s2">can at least propose in the direction of</p>

<p begin="01:29:51.170" end="01:29:58.400" style="s2">extractive and not creative and so you</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.699" end="01:30:00.380" style="s2">know you look at 1971 Nixon getting us</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.400" end="01:30:03.320" style="s2">off the gold standard and off of the</p>

<p begin="01:30:04.459" end="01:30:07.789" style="s2">deregulation that occurred and you see</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.229" end="01:30:09.170" style="s2">that the government and the market</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.789" end="01:30:10.969" style="s2">stopped innovating in the way that they</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.170" end="01:30:12.860" style="s2">had before we stopped having like</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.969" end="01:30:15.679" style="s2">Apollo projects and then Hatton projects</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.860" end="01:30:17.570" style="s2">we started having stupidly bloated f-35s</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.679" end="01:30:21.289" style="s2">it cost 1.5 trillion dollars that we</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.570" end="01:30:25.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t need in the first place and so I</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.289" end="01:30:28.639" style="s2">think that like China right now because</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.010" end="01:30:31.099" style="s2">and you can see why China has an emperor</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.639" end="01:30:32.929" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have term limits and that</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.099" end="01:30:34.789" style="s2">basically got rid of the multipolar</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.929" end="01:30:36.559" style="s2">traps and created a you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.789" end="01:30:37.880" style="s2">top-down control system so they can</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.559" end="01:30:39.709" style="s2">actually coordinate well there&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.880" end="01:30:42.289" style="s2"> up things of dictatorship that</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.709" end="01:30:43.489" style="s2">there&#39;s also if you a democracy or</p>

<p begin="01:30:54.499" end="01:30:58.189" style="s2">case this thing ends up having so many</p>

<p begin="01:30:58.909" end="01:31:03.679" style="s2">that really you have the simulation of a</p>

<p begin="01:31:08.119" end="01:31:12.740" style="s2">and the short term term limits were no</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.790" end="01:31:14.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll invest in long-term stuff so</p>

<p begin="01:31:31.940" end="01:31:37.700" style="s2"> is the thorium research right like</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.520" end="01:31:39.110" style="s2">the the government should have a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.700" end="01:31:42.320" style="s2">also important understand when you look</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.110" end="01:31:43.940" style="s2">at post-world War two a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.320" end="01:31:45.320" style="s2">things that we attribute to market were</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.940" end="01:31:46.550" style="s2">actually because of government spending</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.320" end="01:31:48.650" style="s2">and the market wouldn&#39;t have done it</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.550" end="01:31:51.220" style="s2">otherwise a lot of like the early</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.650" end="01:31:53.330" style="s2">contracts to HP and IBM were government</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.220" end="01:31:55.220" style="s2">contracts that put the money and to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.330" end="01:31:56.630" style="s2">able to do deep R&amp;D that created stuff</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.220" end="01:31:59.330" style="s2">that than the private sector benefited</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.630" end="01:32:01.700" style="s2">for so government&#39;s actually investing a</p>

<p begin="01:32:01.700" end="01:32:06.680" style="s2">then in infrastructure is important and</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.160" end="01:32:08.120" style="s2">so neither is the public sector as the</p>

<p begin="01:32:11.420" end="01:32:15.950" style="s2">like thorium and trains and whatever so</p>

<p begin="01:32:15.950" end="01:32:19.730" style="s2">broke everything right in the financial</p>

<p begin="01:44:24.010" end="01:44:28.330" style="s2">another thing you&#39;ve said in a different</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.650" end="01:44:29.530" style="s2">episode is you are more excited about</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.330" end="01:44:31.310" style="s2">sort of the enlightenment of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.530" end="01:44:34.460" style="s2">feminine and if</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.310" end="01:44:36.740" style="s2">I&#39;m curious if you could talk a little</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.460" end="01:44:38.600" style="s2">about that and then lastly and this is</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.740" end="01:44:41.600" style="s2">in closing you said you&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.600" end="01:44:42.830" style="s2">a lot about you know education or</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.600" end="01:44:45.140" style="s2">thinking a lot about what the future</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.830" end="01:44:47.630" style="s2">applications and maybe in closing any</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.140" end="01:44:49.340" style="s2">any any thoughts thoughts about that as</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.630" end="01:44:53.480" style="s2">relates to what we&#39;ve been discussing it</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.340" end="01:44:55.460" style="s2">comes to mind I yeah I mean I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.480" end="01:44:58.550" style="s2">say as a general statement</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.460" end="01:44:59.810" style="s2">I think central versus decentralizing</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.550" end="01:45:01.580" style="s2">other one of these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.810" end="01:45:03.710" style="s2">oversimplified narrative warfare things</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.580" end="01:45:06.140" style="s2">where of course there are things that</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.710" end="01:45:07.100" style="s2">are better when they&#39;re centralized and</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.140" end="01:45:09.650" style="s2">there are things that are better when</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.100" end="01:45:11.840" style="s2">they&#39;re decentralized and the best</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.650" end="01:45:14.570" style="s2">systems involve the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.840" end="01:45:16.850" style="s2">those things and in a nuanced and</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.570" end="01:45:18.740" style="s2">contextual way because I can show</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.850" end="01:45:20.570" style="s2">failure modes of D central systems like</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.740" end="01:45:21.860" style="s2">basically why China is doing better at</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.570" end="01:45:24.140" style="s2">infrastructure than the u.s. right now</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.860" end="01:45:25.550" style="s2">actually has to do it&#39;s more centralized</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.140" end="01:45:29.540" style="s2">control that doesn&#39;t create multipolar</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.550" end="01:45:32.600" style="s2">traps but then you also see more</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.540" end="01:45:34.250" style="s2">corruption and control and you know less</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.600" end="01:45:37.100" style="s2">of certain kinds of innovation</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.250" end="01:45:38.870" style="s2">incentives with centralization so I</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.100" end="01:45:40.990" style="s2">think the conversation needs to go</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.870" end="01:45:43.490" style="s2">deeper than it usually does there</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.990" end="01:45:45.230" style="s2">similarly if you apply gibberish market</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.490" end="01:45:48.410" style="s2">theory to government&#39;s and say we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.230" end="01:45:51.020" style="s2">become customers and the company serves</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.410" end="01:45:52.730" style="s2">the customer but we know that the</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.020" end="01:45:54.110" style="s2">company can actually manufacture demand</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.730" end="01:45:56.960" style="s2">and capture the customer when it has</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.110" end="01:45:58.730" style="s2">asymmetric capacities like so basically</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.960" end="01:46:02.840" style="s2">I would say that in the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.730" end="01:46:08.540" style="s2">masculine-feminine I think most of like</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.840" end="01:46:13.390" style="s2">we can see the left having a feminism</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.540" end="01:46:15.860" style="s2">that is moved to kind of LGBTQ trans</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.390" end="01:46:16.850" style="s2">ideology and in a racial ideology that</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.860" end="01:46:20.210" style="s2">is kind of represented in</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.850" end="01:46:22.940" style="s2">intersectionality and then we can see a</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.210" end="01:46:24.710" style="s2">very strong backlash to that and alt</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.940" end="01:46:27.050" style="s2">right kind of thinking and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.710" end="01:46:30.530" style="s2">like massively charged stuff here and I</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.050" end="01:46:34.370" style="s2">think the general the underlying ideas</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.530" end="01:46:36.440" style="s2">of what is true and what is good or we</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.370" end="01:46:38.660" style="s2">need to go much deeper on I think the</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.440" end="01:46:40.400" style="s2">Kahn I think the conversation is usually</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.660" end="01:46:42.920" style="s2">framed in a way where I&#39;m rejecting the</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.400" end="01:46:45.170" style="s2">frames and would want to reconstruct the</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.920" end="01:46:47.929" style="s2">frames so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.170" end="01:46:49.429" style="s2">longer conversations totally perfect</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.929" end="01:46:51.560" style="s2">that&#39;s it perfect note to close on</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.429" end="01:46:53.330" style="s2">dinner thank you so much for coming up</p>
