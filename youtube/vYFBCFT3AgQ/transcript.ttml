<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:09.150" style="s2">what is the magellan course in part</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">three we looked at dialectical reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.150" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">in relationship to the evolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:17.039" style="s2">structures of consciousness today in</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:19.590" style="s2">part four we&#39;re going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.039" end="00:00:22.830" style="s2">dialectics and dialectical reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.590" end="00:00:29.220" style="s2">with respect to some contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.830" end="00:00:31.500" style="s2">theories of cognitive development now</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.220" end="00:00:37.850" style="s2">the interesting thing in doing this</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.500" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">video is that to look at the role of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.850" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">dialectical reasoning in cognition we</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">are forced to choose what model of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">development we will consider because the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">model that we choose greatly influences</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">or determines how we answer this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">question what is the role of dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">reasoning in cognitive development and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:22.740" style="s2">so in order to make these this choice in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">this video transparent I wanted to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.740" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">over an overview of the different models</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">of development current models of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">development little brief history of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:38.009" style="s2">models of development now interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:39.810" style="s2">enough when we look at the categories or</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.009" end="00:01:43.799" style="s2">we categorize the models of development</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">we find that they themselves are set up</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.799" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">in a sort of polar relationship so for</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:02:00.509" style="s2">the purposes of this video we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:02:06.439" style="s2">considering Western in other words not</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.509" end="00:02:09.179" style="s2">eastern versions and even within the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.439" end="00:02:13.080" style="s2">choice of the Western model of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.179" end="00:02:15.739" style="s2">development we are going to consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.080" end="00:02:15.739" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">anglo-american and not the Contra</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">distinction which is more continental or</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:40.170" style="s2">Marxian influence so I think this is you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">know this itself links to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.170" end="00:02:47.090" style="s2">dialectical mind of the dualistic mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:52.980" style="s2">we have within just this inquiry the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.090" end="00:02:56.060" style="s2">problem of choosing East versus Western</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.980" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">versions of cognitive psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.060" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">then even within the Western version we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">have the choice of biasing either an</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:11.510" style="s2">anglo-american approach or a continental</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:14.870" style="s2">Marxian approach and just to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:18.739" style="s2">short taste of what that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.870" end="00:03:30.860" style="s2">anglo-american approach is biased toward</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.739" end="00:03:35.239" style="s2">nature in genetics and structuralism in</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.860" end="00:03:42.420" style="s2">the continental Marxian approach is more</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.239" end="00:03:48.230" style="s2">emphasizes culture nurture and related</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.420" end="00:03:52.760" style="s2">nurture and relatedness relational ism</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.230" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">and also in terms of the anglo-american</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.760" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">the emphasis is on individual capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:13.560" style="s2">and the emphasis over here is on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:16.200" style="s2">role of world or life experience and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.560" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that there are some of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.200" end="00:04:21.720" style="s2">tension even within the anglo-american</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:24.090" style="s2">field but within the American</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.720" end="00:04:28.139" style="s2">anglo-american field we&#39;re going to look</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.090" end="00:04:34.469" style="s2">at again another</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.139" end="00:04:38.750" style="s2">in the preferences for modeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.469" end="00:04:44.520" style="s2">cognitive development and this is a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.750" end="00:04:49.710" style="s2">current very update division that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.520" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">that we will see and look at so within</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.710" end="00:04:57.000" style="s2">this bias of primarily and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">anglo-american models of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.000" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">development we have to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:08.879" style="s2">we&#39;re limiting ourselves to that there</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">are two major camps that we can spell</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.879" end="00:05:14.150" style="s2">out that we&#39;ll look at in a little more</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:18.199" style="s2">detail today and the first camp</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.150" end="00:05:20.969" style="s2">emphasizes skills in the second camp</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.199" end="00:05:27.270" style="s2">emphasizes what we might say meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.969" end="00:05:31.080" style="s2">making we might say that for those of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.270" end="00:05:34.669" style="s2">you who know some of the significant</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.080" end="00:05:38.449" style="s2">players here that the skills camp is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.669" end="00:05:43.169" style="s2">exemplified by Piaget and the Neal</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.449" end="00:05:48.029" style="s2">Piaget and the meaning camp by Jane</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.169" end="00:05:50.849" style="s2">Levenger and of course there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.029" end="00:05:57.449" style="s2">a tendency to see this is a masculine</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.849" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">feminine tendency here - okay the skills</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.449" end="00:06:03.060" style="s2">camp under tend to measure so what do</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:12.259" style="s2">they measure they tend to measure</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.060" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">cognitive capacity and in the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.259" end="00:06:24.270" style="s2">models tend to measure languages the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:28.159" style="s2">experiments in the skills models are</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.030" end="00:06:42.110" style="s2">whereas the experiments in the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.030" end="00:06:48.730" style="s2">models are sentence completion tests in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.110" end="00:06:48.730" style="s2">how individuals process and manipulate</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.940" end="00:07:13.130" style="s2">through language the skills models tend</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.700" end="00:07:19.490" style="s2">to be more mathematically measurable and</p>

<p begin="00:07:19.490" end="00:07:26.630" style="s2">tend to require a great deal of</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.630" end="00:07:32.660" style="s2">is a contention between them because</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.660" end="00:07:48.680" style="s2">this is empirical work and this is less</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.880" end="00:07:52.130" style="s2">than empirical this skills models tend</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.680" end="00:07:58.670" style="s2">to emphasize what Piaget is known as</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.130" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">genetic epistemology in other words that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.670" end="00:08:10.730" style="s2">there are genetically inherited</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.420" end="00:08:37.150" style="s2">life it&#39;s a little more fuzzy complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.130" end="00:08:51.330" style="s2">the meaning-making people are attempting</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.580" end="00:08:53.730" style="s2">to become established as being more</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.330" end="00:08:58.920" style="s2">empirical and to make stronger</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.730" end="00:09:01.140" style="s2">statements about structure of stages but</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.920" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">from the perspective of the skills</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.140" end="00:09:08.030" style="s2">models the judgment is that they fail at</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:14.310" style="s2">doing that because they&#39;re not as</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.030" end="00:09:18.150" style="s2">mathematically measurable and then there</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.310" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">is a kind of line drawn in the sand</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.960" end="00:09:35.640" style="s2">genetic stages there are that all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.590" end="00:09:40.430" style="s2">genetic stages go from pre-operational</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.640" end="00:09:44.600" style="s2">these are Piaget Piaget&#39;s stages</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.430" end="00:09:47.610" style="s2">pre-operational the concrete operational</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.600" end="00:09:53.250" style="s2">to formal operational and at formal</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.610" end="00:09:57.710" style="s2">operational we are measuring skills that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.250" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">have to do with abstractions and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.710" end="00:10:03.180" style="s2">according to the skills models there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">nothing higher than formal operations</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.180" end="00:10:08.700" style="s2">although the current the most recent</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:13.050" style="s2">models have outlined very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.700" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">high-level ways of working with</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.050" end="00:10:19.770" style="s2">abstractions and abstract systems but in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:24.060" style="s2">this line of cognitive development</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.770" end="00:10:27.330" style="s2">Theory there is no clear agreement that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.060" end="00:10:34.310" style="s2">there&#39;s any actual genetic stage above</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.330" end="00:10:38.310" style="s2">formal operations whereas this line of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.310" end="00:10:41.580" style="s2">cognitive developmental models makes a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.310" end="00:10:45.570" style="s2">claim that there are actually stages and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.580" end="00:10:47.710" style="s2">adult development when you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.570" end="00:10:53.470" style="s2">the whole picture</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.710" end="00:10:57.730" style="s2">that are clearly beyond and discreet and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.470" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">different and and novel from formal</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.730" end="00:11:05.560" style="s2">operations stages and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:12.340" style="s2">significance is is that it rejects a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.560" end="00:11:15.850" style="s2">of the claims of formal operations so it</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.340" end="00:11:19.030" style="s2">rejects the claims of under that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.850" end="00:11:22.270" style="s2">formal operations it makes meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.030" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">beyond the operations or the claims of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.270" end="00:11:30.010" style="s2">formal operations and so that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:35.280" style="s2">the reasons why we are going to look a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.010" end="00:11:40.450" style="s2">bit into this camp but we will emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.280" end="00:11:43.840" style="s2">the more recent work in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.450" end="00:11:47.070" style="s2">meaning-making area of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.840" end="00:11:51.310" style="s2">development because we are interested in</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.310" end="00:11:59.520" style="s2">development beyond the level of formal</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.840" end="00:12:07.030" style="s2">operations and only people studying in</p>
