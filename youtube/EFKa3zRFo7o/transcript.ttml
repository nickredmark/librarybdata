<p begin="00:01:11.750" end="00:01:14.390" style="s2">and share their thoughts and then we</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:56.120" style="s2">we find ourselves in you know the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.600" end="00:02:59.210" style="s2">is like nothing of course I&#39;ve seen in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.120" end="00:03:02.510" style="s2">my lifetime but you know at the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.210" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">time it&#39;s a it&#39;s a terrible crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.510" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s not an easy exit to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:11.000" style="s2">one but at the same time it gives us</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:15.530" style="s2">it&#39;s the crisis is almost tailor-made</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.000" end="00:03:17.180" style="s2">for a kind of reasonable attitude toward</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.530" end="00:03:19.910" style="s2">the future our thinking about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.180" end="00:03:23.020" style="s2">what&#39;s coming down ahead of us I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.910" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">right now everyone is thinking in future</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.020" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">in terms that we could call future all</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:31.610" style="s2">that is that is to say looking back at</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:34.760" style="s2">where we are now from some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.610" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">imagined place out there which may or</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">may not be one a place we want to go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:42.920" style="s2">so so is very it&#39;s a very good time to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:46.790" style="s2">do some thinking about some long-range</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.920" end="00:03:48.830" style="s2">thinking and that&#39;s that&#39;s what I what</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.790" end="00:03:52.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing I&#39;ve been thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.830" end="00:03:57.800" style="s2">about the way we engage each other in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.930" end="00:04:00.770" style="s2">all kinds of social relations of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.800" end="00:04:03.950" style="s2">the political the whole political world</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.770" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">is in turmoil we have to do some very</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.950" end="00:04:09.260" style="s2">careful thinking about that and so I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:12.410" style="s2">I can discuss any of these issues with</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.260" end="00:04:17.690" style="s2">you anything that is of immediate</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.410" end="00:04:20.299" style="s2">importance to you or significance yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.690" end="00:04:21.859" style="s2">have a few but I wonder what&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.299" end="00:04:23.150" style="s2">alive for you when you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.859" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">thinking about this current situation</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.150" end="00:04:32.570" style="s2">and what&#39;s most alive for me is I is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:38.590" style="s2">think that there&#39;s got to be we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.570" end="00:04:41.419" style="s2">make our way to a more civilized place</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.590" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">we&#39;re in a kind of civilization but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.419" end="00:04:48.530" style="s2">in it&#39;s also in Christ</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:50.840" style="s2">and so I&#39;m looking for ways to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.530" end="00:04:52.819" style="s2">ourselves more civilized and so those</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.840" end="00:04:56.210" style="s2">are those that means addressing some</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.819" end="00:04:58.520" style="s2">very big issues for example racial</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.210" end="00:05:02.180" style="s2">discrimination that&#39;s one of course a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.520" end="00:05:05.000" style="s2">very big one very important another one</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:07.909" style="s2">is the the use of the environment the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.000" end="00:05:12.430" style="s2">use of our land and in both cases it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.909" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">very painful because as Americans as</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.430" end="00:05:19.849" style="s2">being the nation we are we have not done</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:21.830" style="s2">a good job with either of those</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.849" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">categories in the first place we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.830" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">living on stolen land this land really</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:30.020" style="s2">belongs to but you know it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:34.340" style="s2">funny thing when America&#39;s best food</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2">cheap I came to the new world he he</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:40.610" style="s2">actually used the term new world he came</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:42.860" style="s2">right after Columbus was here and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.610" end="00:05:46.569" style="s2">have his we borrowed his name his first</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.860" end="00:05:50.300" style="s2">name Amerigo for the the word American</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.569" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">but when he came he was he was not</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.300" end="00:05:55.789" style="s2">looking for a new world he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:59.090" style="s2">bring the old world with him and what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.789" end="00:06:01.880" style="s2">would like to do is look forward in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.090" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">way that looks toward a new world a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.880" end="00:06:06.979" style="s2">of new categories and so on a lot of new</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:09.830" style="s2">ways to approach things I mean even for</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.979" end="00:06:12.379" style="s2">something as simple as schooling or</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.830" end="00:06:15.319" style="s2">education in the large sense I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.379" end="00:06:16.909" style="s2">could talk about that at length but but</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.319" end="00:06:20.750" style="s2">that that&#39;s now becomes very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.909" end="00:06:23.330" style="s2">important most important for me now even</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.750" end="00:06:27.050" style="s2">though a lot of the future is being</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.330" end="00:06:29.750" style="s2">thought about in technological terms or</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.050" end="00:06:31.310" style="s2">in mechanical terms and so on I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.750" end="00:06:34.310" style="s2">what we need is an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:36.860" style="s2">revolution not so much a revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.310" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">engineering or technology we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.860" end="00:06:43.610" style="s2">enough of that so I&#39;m thinking in those</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:44.930" style="s2">kind of those categories yeah I have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.610" end="00:06:46.909" style="s2">double-click on the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.930" end="00:06:49.009" style="s2">revolution because that speaks to me and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.909" end="00:06:50.029" style="s2">a lot of us here at the stove can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.009" end="00:06:52.399" style="s2">speak more on that what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.029" end="00:06:54.670" style="s2">an intellectual revolution well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.399" end="00:06:58.600" style="s2">rethinking what we do I</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.670" end="00:07:00.250" style="s2">I I I&#39;m as you know from reading my book</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.600" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">I&#39;m heavily influenced by the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.250" end="00:07:05.050" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:07.720" style="s2">I&#39;m also heavily influenced by the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.050" end="00:07:11.350" style="s2">Hebrew tradition the Jews the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.720" end="00:07:16.590" style="s2">tradition especially the rabbinical</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.350" end="00:07:18.790" style="s2">tradition those two combined are</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.590" end="00:07:22.390" style="s2">fascinating in the following way</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.790" end="00:07:24.700" style="s2">that once you get into a deep discussion</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.390" end="00:07:27.430" style="s2">the self-examination what the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.700" end="00:07:30.490" style="s2">called dialectic and what the the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.430" end="00:07:34.290" style="s2">call Talmud the conversation itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.490" end="00:07:39.010" style="s2">begins to convert to community and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.290" end="00:07:41.320" style="s2">becomes a kind of it becomes a people I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.010" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">mean we saw this happen within in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.320" end="00:07:47.350" style="s2">Jewish tradition over the 2,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:51.060" style="s2">since they had the destruction of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.350" end="00:07:53.860" style="s2">Temple in Jerusalem they became a people</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.060" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">by by way of conversation with each</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.860" end="00:07:57.760" style="s2">other it&#39;s quite quite remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.810" end="00:08:00.190" style="s2">and so what I want to do is get into</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.760" end="00:08:02.200" style="s2">that kind of deep conversation about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.190" end="00:08:05.050" style="s2">future deep enough that it creates</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.200" end="00:08:09.460" style="s2">community as well as intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.050" end="00:08:13.350" style="s2">clarity and I know as a you&#39;re leaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.460" end="00:08:17.080" style="s2">toward the Stoics of course they had</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.350" end="00:08:21.190" style="s2">similar similar attitude but but</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.080" end="00:08:24.100" style="s2">basically I consider myself shall we say</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.190" end="00:08:26.890" style="s2">a dialectical thinker that as I want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.100" end="00:08:30.040" style="s2">I want to question where we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.890" end="00:08:34.630" style="s2">look look deeply into it and then see</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.040" end="00:08:36.460" style="s2">where we can go from here yes yes that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.630" end="00:08:41.530" style="s2">resonates a lot that&#39;s sort of like our</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.460" end="00:08:44.260" style="s2">Jam here at the stoah do you see any</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.530" end="00:08:47.020" style="s2">communities that are embodying this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.260" end="00:08:48.670" style="s2">right now well you know I don&#39;t much</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.020" end="00:08:53.740" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you one thing I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.670" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">disappointed in the I&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.740" end="00:09:03.520" style="s2">little history just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:07.000" style="s2">history so so Plato in 400 years in 400</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.520" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">BC roughly found in the Academy he</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.000" end="00:09:12.350" style="s2">bought up he born</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">an olive grove and decided to meet</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.350" end="00:09:18.350" style="s2">students there and established an</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:21.530" style="s2">academy well the Academy lasted seventy</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.350" end="00:09:24.920" style="s2">seven hundred and fifty years quite an</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.530" end="00:09:27.710" style="s2">extraordinary run and there it began not</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.920" end="00:09:34.460" style="s2">only stoicism but also all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.710" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">other movements different different you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.460" end="00:09:40.130" style="s2">know different varieties of Neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:42.230" style="s2">and Platonism aristotelianism and so on</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.130" end="00:09:45.980" style="s2">and Aristotle himself had a school that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.230" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">lasted for for a long time but but and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.980" end="00:09:51.740" style="s2">that school then became over time a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:55.310" style="s2">model for the University now the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.740" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">university in in the it was was really</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.310" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">kind of conceived roughly in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:04.430" style="s2">Platonic mode that is to say a group of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:07.280" style="s2">people getting together talking deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.430" end="00:10:09.650" style="s2">with each other over issues that should</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.280" end="00:10:14.300" style="s2">be of concern to the entire community</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.650" end="00:10:19.910" style="s2">well the what happens happened over time</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.300" end="00:10:21.560" style="s2">is that the the university the modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.910" end="00:10:25.339" style="s2">university has become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.560" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">expensive to operate and therefore in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.339" end="00:10:30.140" style="s2">kind of quest for money they&#39;ve allowed</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">themselves to be influenced by outside</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.140" end="00:10:37.210" style="s2">money and in some ways that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:40.850" style="s2">actually that that money now is</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.210" end="00:10:44.690" style="s2">determining what we know is choosing</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.850" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">what research scientists are yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.690" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">know another they&#39;re making up the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:50.210" style="s2">knowledge we&#39;re going to have whereas</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:53.720" style="s2">for Plato in that in that August</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.210" end="00:10:55.970" style="s2">classical tradition you didn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.720" end="00:10:59.060" style="s2">idea ahead of what you&#39;re going to find</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.970" end="00:11:01.400" style="s2">you you went out on a free search to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.060" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">what was there what you could what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.400" end="00:11:06.110" style="s2">could find but but this is not the case</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:08.900" style="s2">on the modern University and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.110" end="00:11:11.390" style="s2">upset about it I think that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.900" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">happened is that a lot of faculty have</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.390" end="00:11:18.680" style="s2">sold themselves to moneyed supporters</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:21.370" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of selling out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.680" end="00:11:24.950" style="s2">the university itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.370" end="00:11:27.649" style="s2">yeah so one thing we talk about here is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.950" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">like thinking in public and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.649" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">difficult it is so I&#39;m curious in order</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">for this intellectual revolution to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:36.260" style="s2">emerge what do you think are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:37.399" style="s2">barriers that need to be removed and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.260" end="00:11:38.810" style="s2">what do you think are the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.399" end="00:11:41.690" style="s2">that need to be in place for it to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.810" end="00:11:45.019" style="s2">happen well I think the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.690" end="00:11:49.000" style="s2">do is open the university right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.019" end="00:11:52.570" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck in a kind of meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.000" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">situation where people where</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.570" end="00:11:59.870" style="s2">universities are now selecting students</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:03.110" style="s2">because they can grade highly on certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.870" end="00:12:05.149" style="s2">tests and so on and this create this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.110" end="00:12:08.329" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s complicated to explain but</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.149" end="00:12:12.380" style="s2">the meritocracy is attempting to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.329" end="00:12:15.860" style="s2">a kind of permanent upper class of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.380" end="00:12:18.589" style="s2">financial a financial class and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.860" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">it&#39;s terrifically unfair so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.589" end="00:12:26.450" style="s2">thinking about ways of counteracting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:28.940" style="s2">meritocracy in one way just to give you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.450" end="00:12:31.610" style="s2">a shocking idea of some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.940" end="00:12:36.440" style="s2">that&#39;s in my head I would like to to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.610" end="00:12:39.740" style="s2">professionalize student students not</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.440" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">give them scholarships hire them to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.740" end="00:12:46.550" style="s2">students and and break up universities</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:50.360" style="s2">into intellectual centers rather than</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.550" end="00:12:53.209" style="s2">the four-year march through you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.360" end="00:12:56.510" style="s2">the 8th semester program which by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.209" end="00:12:58.130" style="s2">way is completely arbitrary anyway that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.510" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">was never a part of the university</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.130" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">system when it was founded back in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:09.079" style="s2">12th century so so the the what I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">like to see is it&#39;s a whole new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.079" end="00:13:17.209" style="s2">approach to teaching where we spend a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.100" end="00:13:18.709" style="s2">lot of money on education now now people</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.209" end="00:13:22.339" style="s2">are going to save right away well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.709" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">where do we get that money well by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.339" end="00:13:28.630" style="s2">way we are spending over a trillion</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:32.930" style="s2">dollars every year those Americans are</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.630" end="00:13:34.470" style="s2">on the military and if we can pay that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.930" end="00:13:37.199" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.470" end="00:13:40.740" style="s2">two people to go to war we can pay that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.199" end="00:13:42.810" style="s2">much two people to go to school so but</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.740" end="00:13:45.420" style="s2">when I&#39;m what I&#39;m proposing is a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.810" end="00:13:47.310" style="s2">big shift in the way we think about our</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.420" end="00:13:49.500" style="s2">money we think about our future we think</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.310" end="00:13:53.009" style="s2">about our education and we think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.500" end="00:13:55.110" style="s2">the coming crisis which is actually I</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.009" end="00:13:57.149" style="s2">mean the the current crisis is bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.110" end="00:14:00.800" style="s2">enough but the coming crisis is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.149" end="00:14:03.509" style="s2">really bad one that environmental crisis</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:05.459" style="s2">so anyway that&#39;s the way my thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.509" end="00:14:08.129" style="s2">doing this for example that&#39;s one at one</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.459" end="00:14:10.740" style="s2">example of it yeah I love it get you</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.129" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">another example yeah I would say one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.740" end="00:14:15.000" style="s2">the things we have to start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">about it&#39;s an alternative to Ottoman to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.000" end="00:14:19.529" style="s2">the automobile and if you if you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">about it the automobile has now been</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.529" end="00:14:27.449" style="s2">available commercially for a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">fifty years and about an era now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.449" end="00:14:32.360" style="s2">mean just automobiles I mean the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:36.029" style="s2">way of moving ourselves around</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.360" end="00:14:38.339" style="s2">transporting ourselves has been around</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.029" end="00:14:42.889" style="s2">including airplanes beginning in 1903</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.339" end="00:14:45.990" style="s2">with the first flight in in Kitty Hawk</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.889" end="00:14:47.430" style="s2">and then I mean it&#39;s okay it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.990" end="00:14:49.350" style="s2">Peter in a way when you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.430" end="00:14:53.639" style="s2">you see how fast this technology&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.350" end="00:14:55.019" style="s2">developed in 1903 well it sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.639" end="00:14:58.290" style="s2">middle of the nineteenth century they</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.019" end="00:15:00.660" style="s2">began doing the the internal combustion</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.290" end="00:15:03.870" style="s2">engine and and began selling it</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.660" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">commercially then 1903 50 years later</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.870" end="00:15:11.009" style="s2">basically we got off the off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:13.620" style="s2">into the sky and then only 66 years</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.009" end="00:15:16.319" style="s2">later we got a gun we get people on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.620" end="00:15:19.559" style="s2">moon which you know that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.319" end="00:15:21.540" style="s2">very rapid technology but we have we</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.559" end="00:15:23.959" style="s2">have to consider a bit won&#39;t look more</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.190" end="00:16:28.260" style="s2">email is like there&#39;s an ecology of</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.340" end="00:18:39.420" style="s2">think when we when we when we get</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.900" end="00:18:41.100" style="s2">together and talk about real issues we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.420" end="00:18:43.680" style="s2">can start doing that I mean we could</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.100" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">start with with race with distribution</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.680" end="00:18:49.050" style="s2">with the with the way cities are</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:55.350" style="s2">organized with the way we&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.050" end="00:18:57.420" style="s2">suburbs with the way we have taken the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.350" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">heart out of cities but I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.420" end="00:19:03.180" style="s2">look at the ways in which we create art</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">what I mean our do we want museums to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.180" end="00:19:08.280" style="s2">operate the way they do or do we want</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:11.460" style="s2">them right now a museum is a place where</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.280" end="00:19:14.340" style="s2">art ends up I want to see it as a place</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.460" end="00:19:17.310" style="s2">where art starts off I&#39;m gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.340" end="00:19:20.460" style="s2">museums convert to schools to training</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.310" end="00:19:22.370" style="s2">centers and so on among other things I</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.460" end="00:19:26.910" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna see jails</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.370" end="00:19:30.750" style="s2">treated like school it&#39;s not like not</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.910" end="00:19:34.170" style="s2">like like for wall prisons but put a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.750" end="00:19:36.540" style="s2">jail in a in a in a campus and and have</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.170" end="00:19:42.300" style="s2">and have really qualified talented</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.540" end="00:19:45.330" style="s2">teachers and so on so honor codes and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.300" end="00:19:47.610" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of thinkers like I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.330" end="00:19:49.350" style="s2">guess pair academic thinkers that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.610" end="00:19:51.240" style="s2">converging on what you just talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.350" end="00:19:56.280" style="s2">this idea that we need dialogue like</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.240" end="00:19:57.870" style="s2">real dialogue or some logos and it what</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.280" end="00:19:59.580" style="s2">what is that like again the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.870" end="00:20:00.930" style="s2">of the intellectual revolution needs to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.580" end="00:20:05.580" style="s2">occur but what are the conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.930" end="00:20:09.570" style="s2">like genuine dialogue well the the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.580" end="00:20:10.170" style="s2">thing is we need someone you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.570" end="00:20:12.690" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.170" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m again using the classical</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.690" end="00:20:16.680" style="s2">model and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:21.810" style="s2">all died actually Plato remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.680" end="00:20:23.490" style="s2">invented dialogue and and invented what</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.810" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">he called yeah I mean of course the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.490" end="00:20:34.250" style="s2">Greek word is dialectic a dialect</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:37.800" style="s2">dialect and what what he meant by it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.250" end="00:20:41.580" style="s2">someone challenging one person</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.800" end="00:20:44.280" style="s2">challenging another are beginning to ask</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.580" end="00:20:46.770" style="s2">what is it you know how well do you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.280" end="00:20:48.750" style="s2">it and here&#39;s what I think about what</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.770" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">you know and then the other person</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.750" end="00:20:53.850" style="s2">answers and so on and they keep going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:56.190" style="s2">on this exchange and it&#39;s a kind of and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.850" end="00:20:59.070" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s a challenge in a way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.190" end="00:21:00.330" style="s2">a it&#39;s a denial it&#39;s a way of saying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.070" end="00:21:02.520" style="s2">each other I don&#39;t think you&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.330" end="00:21:06.390" style="s2">right about that we want to look more</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.520" end="00:21:09.240" style="s2">deeply into it but but also it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.390" end="00:21:10.980" style="s2">kind of discourse it has no end</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.240" end="00:21:13.590" style="s2">I mean if you read for example if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.980" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">read the Platonic dialogues they never</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.590" end="00:21:18.990" style="s2">come out with a conclusion and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:20.490" style="s2">Aristotle himself even though he took a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.990" end="00:21:25.650" style="s2">lot of very famous views on different</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.490" end="00:21:28.890" style="s2">subjects subjects he he always hesitated</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.650" end="00:21:31.320" style="s2">to come down and fixed on anything and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.890" end="00:21:39.380" style="s2">think that too is a model keep our minds</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.320" end="00:21:45.000" style="s2">open I mean I can go on about this but</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.380" end="00:21:47.640" style="s2">yeah I like that so we&#39;re gonna turn our</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.000" end="00:21:49.770" style="s2">attention to the chat in a moment the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.640" end="00:21:51.390" style="s2">last question you got a book you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.770" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">writing or is coming out can you speak a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.390" end="00:21:56.670" style="s2">little bit more on that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:22:00.810" style="s2">oh yes I&#39;ve written a book I call the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.670" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">poetry of money the poetry of money and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.810" end="00:22:07.650" style="s2">what I mean by that I&#39;m taking again the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:09.720" style="s2">word poetry from the classics places I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.650" end="00:22:11.880" style="s2">actually wrote some about something</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.720" end="00:22:14.160" style="s2">about that in the games book I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.880" end="00:22:16.760" style="s2">little bit of a summary of what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.160" end="00:22:20.520" style="s2">Greeks meant by places which is poetry</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.760" end="00:22:22.230" style="s2">they meant by it the the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.520" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">something absolutely new they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.230" end="00:22:26.170" style="s2">they didn&#39;t mean only verse I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:31.660" style="s2">meant that too but</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.170" end="00:22:33.820" style="s2">but mainly it was kind of someone</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.660" end="00:22:35.830" style="s2">engaged in creative work would start</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.820" end="00:22:38.530" style="s2">something and not know exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.830" end="00:22:41.140" style="s2">they&#39;re going to end to take off with</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.530" end="00:22:43.960" style="s2">without any borders or limits or</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.140" end="00:22:46.990" style="s2">necessary requirements and so on and see</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.960" end="00:22:50.020" style="s2">where it were developed they put this in</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.990" end="00:22:52.890" style="s2">opposition to what they called techno</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.020" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">which which we translate as craft or</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.890" end="00:23:00.610" style="s2">artisanship that&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">so techno techno and poesis are two</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.610" end="00:23:07.660" style="s2">different things all together and when</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:10.660" style="s2">we when we use a technique or technique</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.660" end="00:23:15.490" style="s2">with money mainly what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.660" end="00:23:18.820" style="s2">do is make it it is develop riches out</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.490" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">of what I call Richards whereas to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.820" end="00:23:24.550" style="s2">something creative with money is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:26.230" style="s2">only to and enlarge the money but to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.550" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">enlarge in such a way that it creates</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.230" end="00:23:32.830" style="s2">possibilities out ahead of itself the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">model would be Plato&#39;s Academy he paid</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.830" end="00:23:40.290" style="s2">cash for it he came he paid gold gold</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:43.390" style="s2">coins stamped gold coins and bought this</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.290" end="00:23:45.910" style="s2">this olive grove I&#39;m sure it paid off a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.390" end="00:23:48.550" style="s2">little but that&#39;s not yeah the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.910" end="00:23:50.410" style="s2">not to make money from olives the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.550" end="00:23:52.810" style="s2">was to engage in this course with people</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.410" end="00:23:55.890" style="s2">and that was a payoff that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.810" end="00:23:59.020" style="s2">investment paid off like nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.890" end="00:24:01.270" style="s2">750 years with that heavy intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.020" end="00:24:03.730" style="s2">contribution really shaped thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.270" end="00:24:06.330" style="s2">the entire western world I mean an</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.730" end="00:24:09.430" style="s2">awesome contribution so I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.330" end="00:24:11.770" style="s2">trying to find ways of using money</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.430" end="00:24:18.220" style="s2">spending money that have that creative</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.770" end="00:24:23.370" style="s2">outcome if we use money to to to produce</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.220" end="00:24:26.920" style="s2">to get more money to add to our riches</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.370" end="00:24:30.280" style="s2">that that actually doesn&#39;t work well in</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.920" end="00:24:34.600" style="s2">a society it tends to create classes it</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.280" end="00:24:38.440" style="s2">tends to distort politics and and does a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.600" end="00:24:38.990" style="s2">lot of damage to the economy so I I want</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.440" end="00:24:41.540" style="s2">to try</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.990" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">revision of our thinking about the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.540" end="00:24:49.190" style="s2">we use money I dig it man I dig it so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:51.260" style="s2">just before I ask a choir calling</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.190" end="00:24:53.420" style="s2">someone from the chat to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.260" end="00:24:58.510" style="s2">someone said cars for president 2020 is</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.420" end="00:25:01.270" style="s2">that is that a possibility no okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.510" end="00:25:03.260" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna turn to the questions now</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.270" end="00:25:04.309" style="s2">when I call on you and meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.260" end="00:25:05.990" style="s2">unless you want me to read on your</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.309" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">behalf again this is going to go on</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.990" end="00:25:14.210" style="s2">YouTube please be concise with your</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">question and yeah so let&#39;s do point I</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.210" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to read all the questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:18.470" style="s2">obviously and it won&#39;t be in the order</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:21.070" style="s2">so just FYI fan don&#39;t get to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.470" end="00:25:24.530" style="s2">question so Moritz you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.070" end="00:25:26.770" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be yourself so my question</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.530" end="00:25:29.720" style="s2">is how do you deal with groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.770" end="00:25:31.370" style="s2">playing finite games and that are not</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.720" end="00:25:40.340" style="s2">interested in playing infinite games</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.370" end="00:25:43.070" style="s2">oh no I know it&#39;s what you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.340" end="00:25:45.559" style="s2">have to find ways to talk to people I</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.070" end="00:25:47.030" style="s2">mean they actually what they want you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.559" end="00:25:49.880" style="s2">do what a group is playing when a group</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.030" end="00:25:51.980" style="s2">is playing a finite game and and wants</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.880" end="00:25:54.559" style="s2">to finish that game and so on there</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.980" end="00:25:57.890" style="s2">they&#39;re very unlikely to ask anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.559" end="00:26:00.650" style="s2">join them it&#39;s an exclusive operation so</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.890" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">what you want to do is hang around them</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.650" end="00:26:06.140" style="s2">stay with them learn their language and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:11.720" style="s2">find ways of talking with them outside</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.140" end="00:26:13.730" style="s2">the game now when when some of the I had</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.720" end="00:26:17.179" style="s2">an experience when I was a kid I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.730" end="00:26:19.160" style="s2">through very quickly we we played we had</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.179" end="00:26:22.340" style="s2">a little I was living in Chicago at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.160" end="00:26:24.500" style="s2">time and there were a couple vacant lots</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.340" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">near us we played a softball game there</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.500" end="00:26:28.760" style="s2">every day actually just played softball</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:30.950" style="s2">the game went all day long come and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.760" end="00:26:32.809" style="s2">people come and go and so on every once</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.950" end="00:26:34.820" style="s2">in a while a few brutes would come by</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.809" end="00:26:36.260" style="s2">and they&#39;d want to break up the game</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.820" end="00:26:38.210" style="s2">they want to win the game you know they</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.260" end="00:26:41.179" style="s2">want to get in there but there was a guy</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.210" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">who became a model for me in my in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.179" end="00:26:46.160" style="s2">life a little guy named John filling him</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:49.560" style="s2">he was probably the smallest guy in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.160" end="00:26:52.350" style="s2">whole outfit among my friends</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.560" end="00:26:55.500" style="s2">whose - who who started giving these</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.700" end="00:27:08.040" style="s2">and then got them into the game by way</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.730" end="00:27:10.620" style="s2">of their of their of their label they</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.020" end="00:27:19.230" style="s2">because he found a way of getting into</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.300" end="00:27:20.910" style="s2">their discourse and that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.230" end="00:27:22.920" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do this you&#39;re not going</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.660" end="00:27:37.820" style="s2">with them that is part of their their</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.400" end="00:27:40.140" style="s2">vernacular part of their their their</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.820" end="00:27:41.870" style="s2">dialectic within themselves part of</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.070" end="00:27:52.190" style="s2">good luck great</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.450" end="00:27:52.190" style="s2">Nicholas Benjamin you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.150" end="00:28:01.910" style="s2">here I did thank you so much for writing</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.050" end="00:28:01.910" style="s2">this book for doing all of that research</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.180" end="00:28:11.490" style="s2">on that note it&#39;s with perfect hindsight</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.150" end="00:28:13.470" style="s2">given what you know about the world now</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.490" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">where we are now and where we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.470" end="00:28:19.830" style="s2">you can rewrite finite an evening game</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.760" end="00:28:24.810" style="s2">editor for the first time which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.830" end="00:28:26.820" style="s2">which topic well I</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.810" end="00:28:31.410" style="s2">one thing I didn&#39;t talk about it all in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.820" end="00:28:34.620" style="s2">the in the games book is money you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.410" end="00:28:37.320" style="s2">economics and so on I talk a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.620" end="00:28:40.410" style="s2">it has a kind of political caste if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.320" end="00:28:41.790" style="s2">if you think about it what am I one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.410" end="00:28:44.340" style="s2">the points I want to make in the book</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.790" end="00:28:46.590" style="s2">although it&#39;s a small it makes get a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.340" end="00:28:49.740" style="s2">small point it&#39;s a big point in my head</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.590" end="00:28:53.460" style="s2">and that is we should all be political</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.740" end="00:28:56.280" style="s2">but not have a politics that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.460" end="00:28:59.490" style="s2">that&#39;s what gets us in trouble having a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.280" end="00:29:02.190" style="s2">very fixed idea of what our society</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.490" end="00:29:03.570" style="s2">should be and then trying to go do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.190" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.570" end="00:29:09.179" style="s2">that&#39;s what that was that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:11.789" style="s2">learned from from years of reading marks</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.179" end="00:29:14.309" style="s2">to marks had a very specific idea about</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.789" end="00:29:16.979" style="s2">about the way he wanted to go and it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.309" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">too specific yeah in the end he foiled</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.979" end="00:29:22.049" style="s2">himself he can&#39;t fell into contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:24.509" style="s2">himself and one of the things I would I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.049" end="00:29:28.739" style="s2">would like to do is to look more closely</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.509" end="00:29:33.269" style="s2">at the way we spend money the way we use</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.739" end="00:29:35.999" style="s2">our resources are finite resources and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.269" end="00:29:38.399" style="s2">in a kind of material way I didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.999" end="00:29:41.429" style="s2">that so much in the games but I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:43.379" style="s2">that now with a new book but at least</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.429" end="00:29:45.989" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I wish I had done</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.379" end="00:29:49.320" style="s2">probably one more thing I wish I had</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.989" end="00:29:53.849" style="s2">stressed the importance of evil a little</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.320" end="00:29:56.340" style="s2">bit more because I think we have in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.849" end="00:30:00.690" style="s2">sense well in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.340" end="00:30:05.070" style="s2">remember we killed over 200 million</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.690" end="00:30:08.580" style="s2">people by government action I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.070" end="00:30:11.999" style="s2">this is extraordinary that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.580" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">evil but anyone&#39;s definition so we need</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.999" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">we need to read rethink some of that too</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.489" end="00:30:20.549" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.729" end="00:30:23.309" style="s2">thank you it&#39;s some some delicious</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">pretty critical of our societies like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.309" end="00:30:42.090" style="s2">intensely competitive culture I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:43.470" style="s2">wondering if you see any role for</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.849" end="00:30:49.559" style="s2">might look like oh thank you that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.859" end="00:30:51.090" style="s2">good question yes I do I I think we are</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.090" end="00:30:55.169" style="s2">I think we&#39;re born competitive actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.029" end="00:31:03.690" style="s2">just let me give you a little bit of</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.509" end="00:31:11.669" style="s2">seven and near the end of the 17th</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.070" end="00:31:15.059" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.669" end="00:31:17.299" style="s2">well Hobbes Hobbes made the point that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.059" end="00:31:22.700" style="s2">was not born</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.299" end="00:31:26.600" style="s2">hello oh yeah it&#39;s okay someone just</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.700" end="00:31:34.879" style="s2">went off you dick Hobbs made the point</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.600" end="00:31:37.879" style="s2">that if I still talking to ya I really</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.879" end="00:31:40.129" style="s2">the point that we are born competitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.879" end="00:31:42.440" style="s2">and as soon as we come out of the womb</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.129" end="00:31:44.090" style="s2">we&#39;re grabbing for things said we want</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.440" end="00:31:46.970" style="s2">that stuff we want that one with this</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.090" end="00:31:49.700" style="s2">one and so he invented a figure called</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.970" end="00:31:53.179" style="s2">the Leviathan that that rules over</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.700" end="00:31:54.919" style="s2">society and keeps people from from</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.179" end="00:31:57.289" style="s2">attacking each other eating each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.919" end="00:32:00.230" style="s2">up and so on he&#39;s trying to prevent what</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.289" end="00:32:02.929" style="s2">he called the war of war again the war</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.230" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">of all wars were there where we go into</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.929" end="00:32:10.909" style="s2">battle with each other and and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">loses but but he had a point which i</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.909" end="00:32:16.070" style="s2">think is very important competition</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:18.619" style="s2">comes with being human so a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.070" end="00:32:21.409" style="s2">things we desire we desire them not</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.619" end="00:32:23.330" style="s2">because there&#39;s a shortage of them but</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.409" end="00:32:26.059" style="s2">because we&#39;re competitive for them and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.330" end="00:32:29.210" style="s2">so I think one thing we do is look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.059" end="00:32:32.210" style="s2">the kinds of things we want out of our</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.210" end="00:32:34.489" style="s2">life and try to peg that to our own</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.210" end="00:32:36.649" style="s2">natural competition do we want it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.489" end="00:32:38.809" style="s2">because it will make us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.649" end="00:32:41.330" style="s2">better a little higher a little farther</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.809" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">out than someone else or do we want it</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.330" end="00:32:47.509" style="s2">because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s my own</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.960" end="00:32:49.269" style="s2">desire period that&#39;s that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.509" end="00:32:53.859" style="s2">way of different level of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.269" end="00:32:57.080" style="s2">so yeah I think we remain competitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.859" end="00:33:00.679" style="s2">that&#39;s fine I I like competition</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.080" end="00:33:02.149" style="s2">competition you know there are two</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.679" end="00:33:05.989" style="s2">things that happen when a baby is born</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.149" end="00:33:08.899" style="s2">either it&#39;s very we&#39;re born with two</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.989" end="00:33:11.059" style="s2">kind of contrary instincts the one is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.899" end="00:33:13.129" style="s2">be competitive in a warrior sense and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.059" end="00:33:17.080" style="s2">the other is to be competitive in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.129" end="00:33:19.850" style="s2">playful sense and and I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.080" end="00:33:22.519" style="s2">warrior at times dominates in the player</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.850" end="00:33:25.490" style="s2">at times dominates and so we want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.519" end="00:33:27.799" style="s2">remember that the player is interested</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.490" end="00:33:30.139" style="s2">in keeping the country keeping a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.799" end="00:33:30.740" style="s2">competition going whereas the warrior</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.139" end="00:33:34.490" style="s2">wants to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.740" end="00:33:37.550" style="s2">wants to end it in his or her favor so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.490" end="00:33:39.590" style="s2">so look at yourself that way is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.550" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">kind of a finite player if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.590" end="00:33:44.990" style="s2">something you want if what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:47.929" style="s2">is supporting emphasizing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.990" end="00:33:51.559" style="s2">reinforcing the competitive character of</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.929" end="00:33:53.390" style="s2">human nature then you&#39;re fine if what</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.559" end="00:33:54.860" style="s2">you want to shut people up and make them</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.390" end="00:34:01.010" style="s2">do what you want them to do not what</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.860" end="00:34:08.300" style="s2">they want to do that&#39;s not so good on</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.010" end="00:34:09.950" style="s2">John you had a question they think</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.300" end="00:34:13.820" style="s2">thanks James I&#39;m gonna read out my</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.950" end="00:34:16.940" style="s2">question yeah what do you feel people</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.820" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">most misunderstand misconstrue about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.940" end="00:34:22.340" style="s2">concept of infinite and finite games and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:23.740" style="s2">to ask a slight follow-up what aspects</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.340" end="00:34:26.570" style="s2">of the framework do you think are</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.740" end="00:34:31.940" style="s2">overhyped which aspects do you feel are</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.570" end="00:34:36.530" style="s2">underhyped yeah I can answer that the a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.940" end="00:34:38.649" style="s2">lot of people read the notion a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.530" end="00:34:43.340" style="s2">people when they first hear the term</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.649" end="00:34:46.570" style="s2">infinite tend to think something very</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.340" end="00:34:48.830" style="s2">large happening for them or to them I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.570" end="00:34:52.389" style="s2">I&#39;ve been struck by the number of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.830" end="00:34:56.450" style="s2">business people who&#39;ve who&#39;ve written me</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.389" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">with interest about the infinite game I</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.450" end="00:35:01.640" style="s2">think for some of them they have a kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">of fantasy of an infinite income you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.640" end="00:35:07.790" style="s2">know of multiplying their income many</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:10.940" style="s2">times but that&#39;s not really what I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.790" end="00:35:15.290" style="s2">in mind what I have in mind is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.940" end="00:35:17.480" style="s2">consecutive is a series of engagements</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.290" end="00:35:20.330" style="s2">with each other in which a number of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.480" end="00:35:26.450" style="s2">things happen for one thing it builds</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.330" end="00:35:28.700" style="s2">community we once those who play</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.450" end="00:35:31.070" style="s2">together stay together and use a really</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.700" end="00:35:35.090" style="s2">corny term but but I think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.070" end="00:35:37.220" style="s2">and and so the kind of verbal dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.090" end="00:35:39.560" style="s2">we have with each other the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.220" end="00:35:41.630" style="s2">competition over anything we have with</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.560" end="00:35:44.330" style="s2">each other as long as we are affirming</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.630" end="00:35:47.510" style="s2">our competitive spirit</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.330" end="00:35:51.020" style="s2">then we&#39;re we&#39;re I think on our way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.510" end="00:35:53.540" style="s2">what I would call infinite play but but</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.020" end="00:35:55.850" style="s2">the distortion comes when people think</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.540" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to be the recipient</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.850" end="00:35:59.510" style="s2">of something very large very you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:04.550" style="s2">sort of very big infinite thing out</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.510" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">there well say our riches that&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.550" end="00:36:11.540" style="s2">think is one of the ways in which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:16.190" style="s2">it&#39;s distorted great Dan Feldman he had</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.540" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">a question yes James I have a question</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.190" end="00:36:22.370" style="s2">for you um how does reclaiming the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:26.300" style="s2">Commons relate to infinite games if at</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.370" end="00:36:28.850" style="s2">all say a little more about that we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.300" end="00:36:31.880" style="s2">good well right now we have essentially</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.850" end="00:36:34.610" style="s2">the state and the market and the mark</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.880" end="00:36:37.870" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically a state that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.610" end="00:36:40.430" style="s2">captured by the market and in the last</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.870" end="00:36:42.380" style="s2">at least the last 50 years and probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.430" end="00:36:46.430" style="s2">last since the dawn of the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.380" end="00:36:48.890" style="s2">Revolution maybe back to log enclosures</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.430" end="00:36:52.100" style="s2">and stuff we got rid of we got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.890" end="00:36:53.630" style="s2">the Acamas since then under the forests</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.100" end="00:36:55.310" style="s2">and so on and so forth oh I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.630" end="00:37:00.080" style="s2">reclaiming comments in that sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.310" end="00:37:03.980" style="s2">oh I&#39;m very much before that the I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.080" end="00:37:06.980" style="s2">what happened is what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.980" end="00:37:09.320" style="s2">economically in the last and politically</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.980" end="00:37:11.030" style="s2">of course at the same time in the last</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.320" end="00:37:16.070" style="s2">several centuries I go back to Adam</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.030" end="00:37:19.240" style="s2">Smith on this one Smith as you know had</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.070" end="00:37:23.780" style="s2">the idea of an invisible hand where the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.240" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">market operated on its own by itself it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.780" end="00:37:28.310" style="s2">was a kind of a it&#39;s interesting Smith</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:31.610" style="s2">wrote at the beginning of the mechanic</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.310" end="00:37:36.950" style="s2">of the Industrial Age and so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.610" end="00:37:39.050" style="s2">he had a mechanistic notion of the of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.950" end="00:37:42.530" style="s2">the market in fact it was only a couple</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.050" end="00:37:46.340" style="s2">years after he published his his great</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.530" end="00:37:49.100" style="s2">book for Wealth of Nations when this guy</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.340" end="00:37:53.360" style="s2">this poor guy Lud tried to destroy a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.100" end="00:37:54.280" style="s2">machine and in England so I mean it came</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.360" end="00:37:56.950" style="s2">in that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.280" end="00:37:59.470" style="s2">and that kind of spirit but that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.950" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">notion of a mechanism of a market</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.470" end="00:38:05.140" style="s2">mechanism still dominates today so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:08.050" style="s2">of people think that the market is out</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.140" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">there doing its thing when as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.050" end="00:38:15.700" style="s2">of fact we are deciding what the market</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:18.190" style="s2">is the market is not something as doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.700" end="00:38:20.710" style="s2">it doing to us it&#39;s what we&#39;re doing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.190" end="00:38:22.660" style="s2">ourselves basically and so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.710" end="00:38:24.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to take back the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.660" end="00:38:28.540" style="s2">the market is a function of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.610" end="00:38:30.250" style="s2">imagination not a function of not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.540" end="00:38:31.900" style="s2">function of money or politics or</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.250" end="00:38:34.750" style="s2">anything else because that too is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.900" end="00:38:36.280" style="s2">function of our imagination so so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.750" end="00:38:38.200" style="s2">have to do some very deep thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.280" end="00:38:42.570" style="s2">how we got here and how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.200" end="00:38:45.910" style="s2">get out and I I see ways of getting out</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.570" end="00:38:50.290" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to articulate some of those</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.910" end="00:38:52.810" style="s2">myself and in this book I&#39;ve written so</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.290" end="00:38:58.450" style="s2">thanks thanks from that but I I want</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.980" end="00:39:24.330" style="s2">sexuality in our current context I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.950" end="00:39:30.100" style="s2">believe the quote was that the only true</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.330" end="00:39:34.270" style="s2">revolution is the restoration of genius</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.100" end="00:39:37.660" style="s2">to sexuality so I wonder how thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.270" end="00:39:42.220" style="s2">might flush out in this time well for</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.660" end="00:39:48.580" style="s2">one thing the term genius I take very</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.220" end="00:39:51.390" style="s2">seriously genius is not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.580" end="00:39:55.030" style="s2">necessarily an ability it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.390" end="00:39:57.310" style="s2">working from the center of your of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.030" end="00:40:00.670" style="s2">consciousness of your of your life</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.310" end="00:40:04.390" style="s2">so anything you do from your G you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.670" end="00:40:06.310" style="s2">an act of genius is a genuine act I</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.390" end="00:40:07.140" style="s2">think that&#39;s probably the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.310" end="00:40:11.489" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.140" end="00:40:14.489" style="s2">so try to find that that&#39;s this is very</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.489" end="00:40:17.670" style="s2">hard to do try to find in yourself what</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.489" end="00:40:23.579" style="s2">you consider for yourself to be a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.670" end="00:40:26.339" style="s2">genuine act if you if you&#39;re if it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.579" end="00:40:29.309" style="s2">of your your personal Center which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.339" end="00:40:32.069" style="s2">unlike absolutely unlike anyone elses</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.309" end="00:40:35.670" style="s2">can&#39;t be categorized doesn&#39;t belong to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.069" end="00:40:38.130" style="s2">any sort of type or sexual identity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.670" end="00:40:40.950" style="s2">just it&#39;s you you know deep down then</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.130" end="00:40:43.650" style="s2">once you find that and you you act from</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.950" end="00:40:46.559" style="s2">that act it&#39;s what I call original</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.650" end="00:40:49.319" style="s2">acting or ingenious acting where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.559" end="00:40:52.710" style="s2">where we remove from from ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.319" end="00:40:54.089" style="s2">outward now but the world doesn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.710" end="00:40:57.380" style="s2">like the way we move from ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.089" end="00:41:00.539" style="s2">outward so so conflicts develop and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.380" end="00:41:03.089" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s I think where most</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.539" end="00:41:05.549" style="s2">of the issues lie it&#39;s not not being</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.089" end="00:41:08.249" style="s2">honest with ourselves but being honest</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.549" end="00:41:11.099" style="s2">with the world and taking what the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.249" end="00:41:13.880" style="s2">gives us in response which is often</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.099" end="00:41:18.539" style="s2">negative and critical and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.880" end="00:41:20.549" style="s2">hurtful if not violent so so you it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.539" end="00:41:23.700" style="s2">becomes very delicate the farther out</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.549" end="00:41:26.369" style="s2">you got you the closer you are to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.700" end="00:41:28.680" style="s2">yourself the more expressive you can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.369" end="00:41:30.059" style="s2">but the farther out you have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.680" end="00:41:32.730" style="s2">little a little more careful</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.059" end="00:41:34.460" style="s2">no not I&#39;m not telling you to stop I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.730" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">just saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.460" end="00:41:41.329" style="s2">prepare yourself to be defined not</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:43.410" style="s2">always so a welcome audience out there</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.329" end="00:41:45.210" style="s2">people who wish there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.410" end="00:41:48.210" style="s2">people who don&#39;t want you to be who you</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.210" end="00:41:51.210" style="s2">are because of the fens them in one way</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.210" end="00:41:53.190" style="s2">or another and so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.210" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to start with a recognition</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.190" end="00:42:00.569" style="s2">you have to start with but start but go</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:03.329" style="s2">there anyway love it</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.569" end="00:42:06.930" style="s2">Jessica Watson Miller you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.329" end="00:42:10.619" style="s2">earlier yeah I&#39;m just wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.930" end="00:42:13.559" style="s2">could speak a bit about authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.619" end="00:42:16.470" style="s2">or finite game meanness of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.559" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">authoritarianism and maybe about how</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.470" end="00:42:20.610" style="s2">that relates to the current situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:26.040" style="s2">that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.610" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">yeah well what we see is people who want</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.040" end="00:42:39.480" style="s2">to be winners and the it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:41.700" style="s2">how yeah you know if you if you read</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.480" end="00:42:45.180" style="s2">history a little bit like I do one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.700" end="00:42:47.370" style="s2">them one of the great conflicts you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.180" end="00:42:49.320" style="s2">all the way from the from the time of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.370" end="00:42:53.970" style="s2">the Greeks for the present actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.320" end="00:42:57.660" style="s2">probably the same in Asia is on the one</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.970" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">hand you you have powerful figures who</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.660" end="00:43:03.060" style="s2">want the world to be a certain way then</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:07.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve got creative people under them or</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.060" end="00:43:09.170" style="s2">around them who threatened them now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.170" end="00:43:12.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a very strange thing to me that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.170" end="00:43:16.470" style="s2">that a poet would be more dangerous to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.420" end="00:43:18.900" style="s2">tyrant than another army and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.470" end="00:43:21.390" style="s2">look if you if you read history</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.900" end="00:43:25.280" style="s2">carefully you&#39;ll find that poets are</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.390" end="00:43:28.830" style="s2">often poets journalists writers authors</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.280" end="00:43:33.000" style="s2">creators are all kinds of people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.830" end="00:43:36.930" style="s2">often exiled and and they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:40.680" style="s2">upsetting to the to the rulers so what</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.930" end="00:43:43.980" style="s2">we have now is an anti poetic leadership</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.680" end="00:43:45.540" style="s2">authoritarianism there and there were</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.980" end="00:43:47.490" style="s2">lots of ways to look at it if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.540" end="00:43:51.360" style="s2">mind by being political than better a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.490" end="00:43:55.650" style="s2">number one we see very little sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.360" end="00:43:59.400" style="s2">humor in our leadership a number two not</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.650" end="00:44:02.700" style="s2">any of them not Trump not Xi Jinping not</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.400" end="00:44:04.770" style="s2">not bohlson ro and Brazil not you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.700" end="00:44:09.000" style="s2">this one that one knew and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.770" end="00:44:12.570" style="s2">not not anyway not any of them are</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.000" end="00:44:15.060" style="s2">themselves artists or poets they create</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.570" end="00:44:17.880" style="s2">nothing they&#39;ve given us nothing to live</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.060" end="00:44:20.550" style="s2">by no quotes to live by and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.880" end="00:44:24.300" style="s2">they are poetically starved and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.550" end="00:44:27.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what clinically deprived deprave</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.300" end="00:44:30.780" style="s2">to but but mostly deprived that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.840" end="00:44:32.100" style="s2">my view of authoritarianism it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.780" end="00:44:34.510" style="s2">a dread of poetry</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.100" end="00:44:38.619" style="s2">it&#39;s a dread of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.510" end="00:44:40.300" style="s2">and and there there they are they mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.619" end="00:44:47.560" style="s2">business about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.300" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">Trump is terrified by free thinkers cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.560" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">that answer</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.010" end="00:45:02.849" style="s2">Jeff Loveland your question you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.770" end="00:45:02.849" style="s2">unmute yourself Jeff</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.390" end="00:45:12.039" style="s2">okay maybe I&#39;ll find someone else did it</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.609" end="00:45:29.450" style="s2">Susan did you have a question yes so</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:32.509" style="s2">it&#39;s an honor to to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.450" end="00:45:37.069" style="s2">participate thank you for being here mr.</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.509" end="00:45:40.430" style="s2">Carson um so I&#39;m kind of wandering</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.069" end="00:45:44.599" style="s2">around a what are the mental models that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.430" end="00:45:48.440" style="s2">that have got to shift to you to move</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.599" end="00:45:51.950" style="s2">the dial you kind of alluded to winning</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.440" end="00:45:55.220" style="s2">and I picked up on that win lose but is</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.950" end="00:45:57.470" style="s2">there what what is it that is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.220" end="00:46:02.749" style="s2">got to be that shift that you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.470" end="00:46:04.249" style="s2">got to get the the people to play to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.749" end="00:46:07.400" style="s2">play the infinite game to make that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.249" end="00:46:11.900" style="s2">attractive no it&#39;s very hard to do but</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.400" end="00:46:13.430" style="s2">but I think we can do it by actually let</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.900" end="00:46:16.730" style="s2">me put it this way sis and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.430" end="00:46:17.869" style="s2">have to do it I think we don&#39;t we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.730" end="00:46:22.849" style="s2">very big trouble</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.869" end="00:46:26.299" style="s2">so I mean really big trouble so one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.849" end="00:46:29.509" style="s2">the things I think we need is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.299" end="00:46:31.869" style="s2">kind of gap we need people working with</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.509" end="00:46:36.920" style="s2">each other talking with each other about</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.869" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">problems and whatever those problems are</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.920" end="00:46:43.460" style="s2">we begin we begin relatively small but</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:47.269" style="s2">but this those conversations become can</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.460" end="00:46:54.049" style="s2">become quite large I would I would like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.269" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">to I think I&#39;d like to find ways to to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.049" end="00:47:01.579" style="s2">encourage the creativity the originality</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">of people of freeing themselves from any</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.579" end="00:47:05.720" style="s2">kind of strict ideology I made that one</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:07.190" style="s2">of the things we have today that</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.720" end="00:47:11.989" style="s2">everyone&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.190" end="00:47:14.749" style="s2">is this very sharp division between the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.989" end="00:47:18.440" style="s2">rights and left the end the out up and</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.749" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">down and so on the rich and the poor</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.440" end="00:47:24.250" style="s2">the black and the white these conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:28.579" style="s2">are terrible but I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.250" end="00:47:40.220" style="s2">engage find ways of addressing all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.579" end="00:47:42.589" style="s2">them creatively because you if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.220" end="00:47:45.170" style="s2">say why would we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.589" end="00:47:48.109" style="s2">problems because problems are really</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.170" end="00:47:51.049" style="s2">finite why are we would you say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.109" end="00:47:54.220" style="s2">maybe the the pathway would be to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.049" end="00:47:57.049" style="s2">reframe the conversation about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.220" end="00:47:59.299" style="s2">that&#39;s right you start with the problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.049" end="00:48:01.640" style="s2">but you transform it pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.299" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s why I like the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.640" end="00:48:07.190" style="s2">speaking dialectically that is you you</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:09.799" style="s2">get in a situation say wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.190" end="00:48:12.799" style="s2">I mean if you if you follow like Plato&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.340" end="00:49:50.130" style="s2">right now oh yeah yeah very good</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.680" end="00:49:53.010" style="s2">okay yes right what we have and I made</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.130" end="00:49:55.050" style="s2">the distinction thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.010" end="00:49:58.140" style="s2">I made the distinction in that book</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.050" end="00:49:59.430" style="s2">between the community Oz and Civitas if</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.140" end="00:50:03.720" style="s2">you remember right</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.430" end="00:50:07.890" style="s2">and and Civitas is a society thought of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.720" end="00:50:10.440" style="s2">top top down whereas communitas is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.890" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">society thinking about itself from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.440" end="00:50:17.160" style="s2">bottom up so it&#39;s a neighborhood is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:20.010" style="s2">community the city government is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.160" end="00:50:22.200" style="s2">Civitas and so on but Civitas involves a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.010" end="00:50:25.710" style="s2">lot more it involves it a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.200" end="00:50:31.140" style="s2">social mores you know except in public</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.710" end="00:50:34.250" style="s2">behavior of unwritten laws and and so on</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.140" end="00:50:37.350" style="s2">whereas communitas doesn&#39;t have a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.250" end="00:50:42.660" style="s2">content it has a certain style though of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.350" end="00:50:44.100" style="s2">originality and creativity so the you</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.660" end="00:50:48.360" style="s2">know to pick up when I said a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.100" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">earlier of what a lot of political</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.360" end="00:50:53.850" style="s2">leaders are afraid of is the communities</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:55.970" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.850" end="00:50:59.580" style="s2">another Civitas as much as they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.970" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">rival Civitas as much as they are the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.580" end="00:51:03.690" style="s2">communities underneath them I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:09.110" style="s2">worst thing you can do to a dictator is</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.690" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">laugh at the dictator and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.110" end="00:51:15.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s very interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:17.010" style="s2">Trump doesn&#39;t have a sense of humor he</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.120" end="00:51:19.290" style="s2">can&#39;t laugh he definitely can&#39;t laugh at</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.010" end="00:51:21.540" style="s2">himself but also can&#39;t have anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.290" end="00:51:24.540" style="s2">laugh at him he&#39;s very very delicate</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.540" end="00:51:27.180" style="s2">about that so so great leaders are</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.540" end="00:51:30.090" style="s2">people who who expect to be laughed at</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.180" end="00:51:33.840" style="s2">Roosevelt said the bankers are scorning</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.090" end="00:51:36.630" style="s2">me haha I love it you know and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.840" end="00:51:38.580" style="s2">so we we need we need an attitude toward</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.630" end="00:51:40.650" style="s2">community to us like that it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.580" end="00:51:43.910" style="s2">refreshing and very liberating and very</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.650" end="00:51:48.750" style="s2">Reforma thanks for the question</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.910" end="00:51:50.910" style="s2">thank you so much Anton you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.750" end="00:51:54.270" style="s2">question above about money if you would</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.910" end="00:51:57.960" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask that yeah Thank</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.960" end="00:52:03.150" style="s2">James for this so much of this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.750" end="00:52:05.880" style="s2">resonating I had a question in James</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.150" end="00:52:07.470" style="s2">about about economics you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.880" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">about economics earlier we thought you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.470" end="00:52:14.520" style="s2">thought you talking about money and my</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:17.850" style="s2">question was do you think we can play</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.520" end="00:52:21.180" style="s2">infinite games without current form of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.850" end="00:52:23.340" style="s2">money or can we at least expand the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.180" end="00:52:26.310" style="s2">nature of the games that we play with</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.340" end="00:52:29.370" style="s2">our current form of money and or do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.310" end="00:52:31.050" style="s2">need do we need new form of new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.370" end="00:52:33.120" style="s2">money in the forms of economics in order</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.050" end="00:52:34.290" style="s2">to really create infinite games how much</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.120" end="00:52:37.170" style="s2">can we do with our current form of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.290" end="00:52:39.990" style="s2">linear in economics yeah well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.170" end="00:52:42.330" style="s2">think we need a new form of money I</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.990" end="00:52:45.030" style="s2">think we need a new attitude toward</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.330" end="00:52:47.130" style="s2">money now I I make a distinction you</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.030" end="00:52:48.750" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to carry this</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.130" end="00:52:52.080" style="s2">off and I&#39;m making a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.750" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">being rich and being wealthy now to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.080" end="00:52:58.370" style="s2">rich is to add to the amount of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:53:00.990" style="s2">you have or whatever your currency is</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.370" end="00:53:04.130" style="s2">and you that&#39;s something you can count</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.990" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">it belongs only to you its individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.130" end="00:53:08.370" style="s2">and no one else has a legal right to it</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:12.330" style="s2">but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.370" end="00:53:17.940" style="s2">whereas wealth I take is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.330" end="00:53:21.450" style="s2">different thing the I I want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.940" end="00:53:25.020" style="s2">to the word itself wealth wheel meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.450" end="00:53:28.140" style="s2">the well-being of a situation or a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.020" end="00:53:33.180" style="s2">country or a person or a community and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.140" end="00:53:37.020" style="s2">and so one way of spending money is for</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.180" end="00:53:39.750" style="s2">the well-being of a community and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.020" end="00:53:42.780" style="s2">one of the very most effective ways of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.750" end="00:53:45.660" style="s2">doing that is education spending money</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.780" end="00:53:48.980" style="s2">on schools that&#39;s those are really great</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.660" end="00:53:54.140" style="s2">investments those investments pay off</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.980" end="00:53:57.750" style="s2">whereas if you invest just to get richer</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.140" end="00:54:00.390" style="s2">that really kind of shuts the money down</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.750" end="00:54:03.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the flow down and nothing really</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.390" end="00:54:06.180" style="s2">much comes of it that&#39;s why if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.510" end="00:54:09.000" style="s2">look at the at the money classes of very</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.180" end="00:54:12.510" style="s2">rich people we find very little going on</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.000" end="00:54:16.260" style="s2">that&#39;s original creative artistic lovely</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.510" end="00:54:20.600" style="s2">and so on I mean I look at a museum with</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.260" end="00:54:24.510" style="s2">with big names on it as a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.600" end="00:54:27.060" style="s2">testimony of those people that this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.510" end="00:54:31.740" style="s2">something they can&#39;t do they&#39;ve they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.060" end="00:54:33.540" style="s2">hiring artists to sort of an oval their</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.740" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">name well that&#39;s it that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.540" end="00:54:38.520" style="s2">terrible use of money why don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:41.190" style="s2">give that money to a school and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.520" end="00:54:43.740" style="s2">develop artists allow artists to grow</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.190" end="00:54:46.620" style="s2">out of and so on I I think I think there</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.740" end="00:54:49.560" style="s2">are ways of using money that are that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.620" end="00:54:53.490" style="s2">are creative hopeful and will end in</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.560" end="00:54:58.430" style="s2">communities well-being yeah can I just</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.490" end="00:55:01.530" style="s2">add one thing my concern with money is</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.430" end="00:55:04.110" style="s2">basically that the medium of exchange is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.530" end="00:55:09.030" style="s2">the message so if you up do something to</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.110" end="00:55:13.020" style="s2">Marshall McLuhan there and our whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.030" end="00:55:17.850" style="s2">society our whole culture is built</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.020" end="00:55:21.690" style="s2">around the money system and it&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.850" end="00:55:23.220" style="s2">by the powers that be and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.690" end="00:55:25.380" style="s2">wonder if we can ever really play in</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.220" end="00:55:29.850" style="s2">connect games with it so I think money</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.380" end="00:55:31.800" style="s2">creation is such a central aspect to to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.850" end="00:55:35.400" style="s2">whether we are in a finite or an</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.800" end="00:55:38.240" style="s2">infinite game no I I&#39;m all in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.400" end="00:55:40.950" style="s2">the kind of investment that will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.240" end="00:55:42.540" style="s2">investments rather than the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.950" end="00:55:46.440" style="s2">investment that will lead to someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.540" end="00:55:50.580" style="s2">riches and and what that usually means</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.440" end="00:55:52.710" style="s2">is a communal expense that is to say a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.580" end="00:55:56.360" style="s2">focus on the way communities are</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.710" end="00:55:59.790" style="s2">organized and what they&#39;re doing and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.360" end="00:56:03.570" style="s2">and and giving a lot of freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.790" end="00:56:06.200" style="s2">different organizations and so on I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.570" end="00:56:09.230" style="s2">one of the few heard my</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.200" end="00:56:12.470" style="s2">branch about the university where right</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.230" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">now wealth riches rather are really</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.890" end="00:57:25.190" style="s2">copies and given you my question many</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.090" end="00:57:26.360" style="s2">people are playing finite games either</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.190" end="00:57:28.700" style="s2">because they&#39;re in fairly desperate</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.360" end="00:57:30.380" style="s2">conditions or they imagine that they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.700" end="00:57:32.870" style="s2">in desperate conditions for various</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.380" end="00:57:34.460" style="s2">psychological reasons what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.870" end="00:57:37.670" style="s2">happen for these people to start playing</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.460" end="00:57:39.590" style="s2">infinite games oh that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.670" end="00:57:44.080" style="s2">hard I know I know exactly what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.590" end="00:57:49.400" style="s2">I I mean I I grew up I was a kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.080" end="00:57:52.940" style="s2">mean well I was very athletic when I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.400" end="00:57:56.540" style="s2">young I actually paid my way through</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.940" end="00:58:00.830" style="s2">college I sort of regret to say but it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.540" end="00:58:04.430" style="s2">did and and I think one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.830" end="00:58:06.500" style="s2">wrote the book is that my experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.430" end="00:58:10.010" style="s2">being an athlete a very competitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.500" end="00:58:11.930" style="s2">athlete was not pleasant it was if there</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.010" end="00:58:16.010" style="s2">was something about it that I really</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.930" end="00:58:19.030" style="s2">didn&#39;t like and it was it was full of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.010" end="00:58:23.030" style="s2">all kinds of tensions and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.030" end="00:58:25.849" style="s2">psychological tricks and so on that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.030" end="00:58:27.800" style="s2">just didn&#39;t ring ring true to me so it</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.849" end="00:58:30.290" style="s2">took me a long time to sort of break out</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.800" end="00:58:33.680" style="s2">of that to free myself from that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.290" end="00:58:36.580" style="s2">very rigid conception of a finite game I</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.680" end="00:58:41.119" style="s2">think I think the only way to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.580" end="00:58:45.109" style="s2">not to it&#39;s not to come head to head</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.119" end="00:58:47.180" style="s2">with other finite players you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.109" end="00:58:50.599" style="s2">to be a finite player trying to edify it</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.180" end="00:58:53.540" style="s2">a finite game you know you you you want</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.599" end="00:58:55.580" style="s2">somehow to pick up as I said a little</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.540" end="00:58:57.170" style="s2">earlier pick up their rhetoric the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.580" end="00:59:00.080" style="s2">they think the way they talk with each</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.170" end="00:59:01.970" style="s2">other their vocabulary their conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.080" end="00:59:05.060" style="s2">the way they conceptualize things and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.970" end="00:59:09.140" style="s2">and begin talking that way but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.060" end="00:59:12.619" style="s2">I&#39;m not easy that&#39;s hard and you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.140" end="00:59:17.410" style="s2">have to come at it as maybe a companion</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.619" end="00:59:19.670" style="s2">or a co player yourself and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.410" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s the only way of going about a</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.670" end="00:59:31.220" style="s2">direct encounter won&#39;t work it may work</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:33.440" style="s2">but it probably won&#39;t anymore and hey</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.220" end="00:59:39.230" style="s2">you hungry for a couple more change</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.440" end="00:59:41.140" style="s2">weekend yeah okay we just got one from a</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.230" end="00:59:47.869" style="s2">cow if you want to reach your question</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.140" end="00:59:49.660" style="s2">yes thank you James Peter sorry so as we</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.869" end="00:59:52.900" style="s2">know in our democratic system</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.660" end="00:59:56.330" style="s2">you know election needs to win election</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.900" end="00:59:59.780" style="s2">they have finished terms and the terms</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.330" end="01:00:03.050" style="s2">are you know short windows in the grand</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.780" end="01:00:06.770" style="s2">scheme of things how can we make sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.050" end="01:00:11.570" style="s2">that the magnetic system are played with</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.770" end="01:00:15.530" style="s2">players with infant mindset oh I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.570" end="01:00:20.510" style="s2">think the only way to do it is somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.530" end="01:00:26.500" style="s2">indirectly that is to say create a kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.510" end="01:00:30.619" style="s2">of what I would what I call in other</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.500" end="01:00:31.570" style="s2">books a Humanitas namely our community</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.619" end="01:00:35.950" style="s2">eyes rather</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.570" end="01:00:39.420" style="s2">we&#39;re where we have a broad shared</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.950" end="01:00:42.370" style="s2">notion of what fair competition is</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.420" end="01:00:45.220" style="s2">that&#39;s very very hard to develop you</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.370" end="01:00:48.550" style="s2">know in a large country like Canada or</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.220" end="01:00:52.110" style="s2">the United States but but it is possible</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.550" end="01:00:56.890" style="s2">you have to prepare the in other words</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.110" end="01:00:59.380" style="s2">the the persons who need most to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.890" end="01:01:01.390" style="s2">corrected are not the politicians</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.380" end="01:01:05.320" style="s2">they&#39;re the people who choose the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.390" end="01:01:08.320" style="s2">politicians so so that&#39;s where you start</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.320" end="01:01:12.100" style="s2">you start at the bottom and you you go</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.320" end="01:01:13.690" style="s2">to people you talk to people and in</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.100" end="01:01:15.820" style="s2">their language their their discourse</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.690" end="01:01:19.240" style="s2">their their dialogue their their</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.820" end="01:01:22.420" style="s2">dielectric and so on and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.240" end="01:01:24.220" style="s2">work up that way rather than then try to</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.420" end="01:01:26.980" style="s2">pick out somebody who&#39;s going to do it</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.220" end="01:01:28.600" style="s2">for you from the top down but those are</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.980" end="01:01:30.940" style="s2">movements very difficult to develop</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.600" end="01:01:33.820" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.940" end="01:01:37.510" style="s2">beginnings of it right now in the after</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.820" end="01:01:40.600" style="s2">the the covin crisis we&#39;re seeing and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.510" end="01:01:43.630" style="s2">you know in the racial issue right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.600" end="01:01:45.640" style="s2">in America especially a beginning we see</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.630" end="01:01:48.700" style="s2">a movement beginning that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.640" end="01:01:51.430" style="s2">have I&#39;m quite sure profound effect on</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.700" end="01:01:54.370" style="s2">the on the upper structure on the on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.430" end="01:01:55.780" style="s2">leadership structure of the society so</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.370" end="01:01:57.640" style="s2">we should we should look for that but</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.780" end="01:02:03.160" style="s2">that&#39;s where we go we go from the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.640" end="01:02:08.170" style="s2">up not the top down cool happy you had a</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.160" end="01:02:10.330" style="s2">question yeah hi Jim um my question is</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.170" end="01:02:13.660" style="s2">about are there times where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.330" end="01:02:18.310" style="s2">necessary to play the finite game within</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.660" end="01:02:25.900" style="s2">the infinite game sure oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.310" end="01:02:29.200" style="s2">funny games can be wonderful the key</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.900" end="01:02:32.800" style="s2">though is what you&#39;re doing when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.200" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">play the finite game if if if you are</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.800" end="01:02:38.830" style="s2">truly putting yourself ahead of someone</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.280" end="01:02:42.280" style="s2">you know go back to the notion between</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.830" end="01:02:44.900" style="s2">the warrior and the play the player the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.280" end="01:02:49.339" style="s2">warrior wants to end the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.900" end="01:02:51.829" style="s2">test in his or her favor and whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.339" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">player wants to end the contest but then</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.829" end="01:02:57.769" style="s2">it&#39;s ready for another you know another</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:58.190" style="s2">level of play and that&#39;s the important</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.769" end="01:03:01.640" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.190" end="01:03:04.460" style="s2">it&#39;s long as you you don&#39;t want to bring</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.640" end="01:03:06.859" style="s2">the thing to a definitive end then</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.460" end="01:03:09.349" style="s2">you&#39;re more on the side of an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.859" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">player than you are a finite player and</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.349" end="01:03:12.589" style="s2">there are a lot of finite games</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:16.339" style="s2">interfund that are fun to play I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.589" end="01:03:18.019" style="s2">think even a profession or a sports</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.339" end="01:03:20.710" style="s2">event or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.019" end="01:03:23.720" style="s2">I can qualify as a perfectly legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.710" end="01:03:30.049" style="s2">wonderful in fact even sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.720" end="01:03:31.819" style="s2">beneficial find out game great Jeff</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.049" end="01:03:35.529" style="s2">Loveland I think you&#39;re back if you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.819" end="01:03:37.789" style="s2">ask your question yes thanks Peter</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.529" end="01:03:40.160" style="s2">thank you mister cars how do we</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.789" end="01:03:42.440" style="s2">cultivate discernment and identifying</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.160" end="01:03:59.140" style="s2">people who talked the infinite game talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.440" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">but don&#39;t walk the infinite game so</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.140" end="01:04:05.749" style="s2">those are the people I know a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:08.359" style="s2">people I know don&#39;t want to lose</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.749" end="01:04:12.170" style="s2">anything you know they they want always</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.359" end="01:04:16.309" style="s2">to be some on the winning side so I and</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.170" end="01:04:23.900" style="s2">I know a lot of examples in my life of</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.309" end="01:04:27.559" style="s2">people who you know will well just take</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.900" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">a really simple example I I placed a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.559" end="01:04:37.069" style="s2">of squash in my younger years obviously</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:40.220" style="s2">but but I I remember being really brutal</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.069" end="01:04:42.650" style="s2">on them on the court you know hitting</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.220" end="01:04:45.799" style="s2">that ball like you know just like I</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.650" end="01:04:50.059" style="s2">wanted to kill the ball and my opponent</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.799" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">and then going out for a cafe latte you</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.059" end="01:04:55.099" style="s2">know afterwards and so on laughing and</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:58.200" style="s2">even forgetting who won the game but it</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.099" end="01:05:00.270" style="s2">was great fun playing it but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.200" end="01:05:02.460" style="s2">tricky at the beginning you you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.270" end="01:05:04.140" style="s2">you can&#39;t you you you have to you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.460" end="01:05:06.240" style="s2">to make a judgment some people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.140" end="01:05:08.730" style="s2">want to some people just want to win I</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.240" end="01:05:10.920" style="s2">mean there are people in that this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.730" end="01:05:13.349" style="s2">when I was still teaching it and while</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.920" end="01:05:15.540" style="s2">you we had a big the kind of a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.349" end="01:05:18.180" style="s2">squash courts and there was a crowd that</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.540" end="01:05:20.040" style="s2">played and there were there were people</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.180" end="01:05:22.829" style="s2">in that crowd who really didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.040" end="01:05:25.320" style="s2">lose and and you had to avoid them I</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.829" end="01:05:27.180" style="s2">mean they were they were not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.320" end="01:05:28.700" style="s2">really not fun to play with or not in</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.180" end="01:05:33.630" style="s2">particularly good to play with either</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.700" end="01:05:36.810" style="s2">and even when I beat them upset but</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.630" end="01:05:40.410" style="s2">usually I lost anyway thanks for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.810" end="01:05:42.060" style="s2">question so here&#39;s a question maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.410" end="01:05:44.160" style="s2">will be the question we end off with I</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.060" end="01:05:47.849" style="s2">don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any more will come</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:49.619" style="s2">in but here is one that I was asked to</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.849" end="01:05:51.690" style="s2">read ok do you have any suggestions for</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.619" end="01:05:54.240" style="s2">regular daily religious mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.690" end="01:05:59.220" style="s2">practices can you discuss any daily</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.240" end="01:06:05.960" style="s2">practice that you have I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.220" end="01:06:11.849" style="s2">have I don&#39;t have what you could call a</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.960" end="01:06:15.510" style="s2">discipline you know a yoga or any sort</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.849" end="01:06:18.869" style="s2">of chanting or the material activities</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.510" end="01:06:23.400" style="s2">so on but I do have I try to maintain an</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.869" end="01:06:27.260" style="s2">attitude of always looking for where the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.400" end="01:06:29.849" style="s2">mystery is no matter what the issue is</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.260" end="01:06:32.970" style="s2">what is mysterious about this</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.849" end="01:06:34.470" style="s2">particularly even a very plain event you</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.970" end="01:06:36.450" style="s2">want to look at it and say no wait a</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.470" end="01:06:39.359" style="s2">minute that doesn&#39;t explain everything</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.450" end="01:06:42.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on here I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.359" end="01:06:46.980" style="s2">get what could that possibly be and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.119" end="01:06:50.280" style="s2">kind of focus on that and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.980" end="01:06:52.680" style="s2">would be my my the simplest answer I</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.280" end="01:06:56.069" style="s2">have to that and that but that comes</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.680" end="01:07:01.560" style="s2">after years and years and years of of</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.069" end="01:07:04.290" style="s2">reading a lot of religious texts having</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.560" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">a lot of exposure to different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.290" end="01:07:10.490" style="s2">religious disciplines and never quite</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:14.609" style="s2">being taken up by any of</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.490" end="01:07:19.140" style="s2">but but having an attitude of well you</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.609" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">know maybe for all of them right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.140" end="01:07:23.640" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll close off with a question we</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:26.670" style="s2">last chat when he came on the podcast we</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.640" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">talked about this term the metagame that</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.670" end="01:07:29.700" style="s2">a lot of people that everyone geeks out</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">about meta nowadays it&#39;s like the word</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.700" end="01:07:33.329" style="s2">that people love to use yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:35.069" style="s2">the idea of the meta game like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.329" end="01:07:36.990" style="s2">an ecology of games of finite if in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.069" end="01:07:38.460" style="s2">games and then being able to go above</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.990" end="01:07:40.109" style="s2">them and have a look at them and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.460" end="01:07:42.950" style="s2">you know figure out which one to play</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.109" end="01:07:44.910" style="s2">from that you find that a useful comment</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.950" end="01:07:46.170" style="s2">concept you find it redundant like</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.910" end="01:07:49.380" style="s2">what&#39;s your thoughts on this this thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.170" end="01:07:52.380" style="s2">of a useful yeah you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.380" end="01:07:55.680" style="s2">but I would say sure you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.380" end="01:07:59.630" style="s2">come to kind of I think it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.680" end="01:08:03.450" style="s2">helpful to step back step up look down</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.630" end="01:08:05.309" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been doing look around kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.450" end="01:08:09.089" style="s2">of withdraw for a while and take that</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.309" end="01:08:10.440" style="s2">reflective attitude I&#39;ll give that give</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.089" end="01:08:14.670" style="s2">everything you&#39;re doing a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.440" end="01:08:18.810" style="s2">reflective attitude oh yeah I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.670" end="01:08:21.859" style="s2">more in favor of it I would as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.810" end="01:08:24.989" style="s2">mechanical kind of process I probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.859" end="01:08:31.170" style="s2">would probably be a little skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.989" end="01:08:32.489" style="s2">about it cool so before we close out do</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.170" end="01:08:36.540" style="s2">you have any kind of final thoughts for</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.489" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">us James no but I do well I do it away</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.540" end="01:08:46.279" style="s2">and that is make sure we I want to make</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:52.440" style="s2">sure we all use this terrific crisis as</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.279" end="01:08:56.159" style="s2">not as a way of looking forward beyond</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.440" end="01:08:58.920" style="s2">it not just at the crisis itself or its</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.159" end="01:09:01.290" style="s2">solution try to keep in mind the fact</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.920" end="01:09:03.900" style="s2">that this is going to be terrible but</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.290" end="01:09:06.989" style="s2">something worse is coming I think the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.900" end="01:09:09.210" style="s2">the environmental issues sort of racing</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.989" end="01:09:14.429" style="s2">at us from the other end of the century</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.210" end="01:09:17.250" style="s2">I really I I&#39;m quite quite impressed</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.429" end="01:09:20.880" style="s2">with how serious they are so I want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.250" end="01:09:22.710" style="s2">say remember this is a terrific problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.880" end="01:09:26.330" style="s2">terrific crisis but they</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.710" end="01:09:30.540" style="s2">a bigger one coming prepare for it</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.330" end="01:09:31.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a good note to leave on so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.540" end="01:09:33.000" style="s2">make some closing announcements and</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.680" end="01:09:34.319" style="s2">maybe you can hang on just for a couple</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.000" end="01:09:35.069" style="s2">more minutes to kind of hear what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.319" end="01:09:38.009" style="s2">doing here at the store</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.069" end="01:09:39.569" style="s2">James I think you quite like it but yeah</p>

<p begin="01:10:30.210" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2">the ways that those have changed</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.100" end="01:10:37.380" style="s2">throughout time and use the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.320" end="01:10:39.360" style="s2">that led to changes in worldviews as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.380" end="01:10:41.670" style="s2">jumping off point for maybe creating</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.360" end="01:10:43.770" style="s2">some cognitive flexibility around the</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.670" end="01:10:46.230" style="s2">way that we view the world right now so</p>
