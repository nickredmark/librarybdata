<p begin="00:00:03.689" end="00:00:14.280" style="s2">meditation I&#39;m feeling very peaceful and</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.490" end="00:00:16.109" style="s2">well doing meditation I had I felt many</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.280" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">thoughts many thoughts that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:20.340" style="s2">meditation is is sitting and breathing</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">and relaxing my body and letting the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.340" end="00:00:25.109" style="s2">thoughts flow through and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:27.269" style="s2">trying to make these videos and explain</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.109" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">my global cooperative and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.269" end="00:00:32.009" style="s2">that&#39;s still a mission I&#39;m on I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:34.469" style="s2">figuring out how to best explain this</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.009" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">amazing solution that is coming through</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.469" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">me so that the people who are first</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">supposed to come on board keep them on</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">board but also in doing so I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">been watching other people&#39;s YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">videos and the ones that I feel drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">I mean believe me they&#39;re better editing</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:56.460" style="s2">and everything than I am but the big</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:00:59.820" style="s2">difference I think is that they talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.460" end="00:01:04.650" style="s2">about themselves and are vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.820" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">people can see them and so maybe I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.650" end="00:01:09.560" style="s2">supposed to be talking about my idea and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:12.860" style="s2">I&#39;m supposed to be talking about me</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.560" end="00:01:15.740" style="s2">because if that&#39;s what I&#39;m drawn to and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.860" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.740" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">grappling with it&#39;s been an issue is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">this idea that when you&#39;re attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">someone or with someone to folks and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">emotion in you it&#39;s because of something</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">in yourself so if you hate someone and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">they&#39;re annoying you it&#39;s because you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">have that thing that they&#39;re annoying</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2">you based on and if you&#39;re attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">someone then the same thing right if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">find someone&#39;s beauty and essence</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">amazing then it&#39;s because you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:52.890" style="s2">a piece of you in them so there were</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">swings both ways and realizing over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.890" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">last year that I do in fact like women</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">that I&#39;m not as straight I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:02.250" style="s2">straight at all it&#39;s like zero</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">straightest to me but I thought a year</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.250" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">ago that I was straight that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">identified us and figuring out who I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:13.569" style="s2">attracted to and then I&#39;m attractive to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:18.159" style="s2">more masculine women or in drugs</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.569" end="00:02:19.659" style="s2">as women and trying to figure out okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.159" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">to wait does that mean that I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.659" end="00:02:24.010" style="s2">like that or am i attracted to that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">holding those two things at the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.010" end="00:02:28.150" style="s2">time like I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:29.560" style="s2">I love women with short hair but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.150" end="00:02:31.569" style="s2">know if I want short hair even though I</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.560" end="00:02:32.980" style="s2">wear my hair in a ponytail all the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.569" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">and I get annoyed with my long hair I</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.980" end="00:02:40.840" style="s2">also strongly I&#39;m attached to it that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:41.919" style="s2">know one of my one of the times I always</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.840" end="00:02:43.959" style="s2">say that I don&#39;t care what I look like</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.919" end="00:02:45.790" style="s2">one of the times that was clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.959" end="00:02:47.799" style="s2">evident that&#39;s not quite as true as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.790" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">thought it was was before my first brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.799" end="00:02:53.919" style="s2">surgery when I didn&#39;t understand how</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">much of my hair was gonna be shaved it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.919" end="00:02:57.909" style="s2">was my biggest worry going into it I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">like shave as little as possible I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.909" end="00:03:02.379" style="s2">want my hair and they shaved a small</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.040" end="00:03:05.709" style="s2">patch back here and it slowly grew in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.379" end="00:03:08.230" style="s2">and after my second brain surgery Wow</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.709" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">two years ago today today&#39;s the 31st</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.230" end="00:03:13.150" style="s2">isn&#39;t it of August two years ago today</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:16.030" style="s2">and they had to do it was my scars</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.150" end="00:03:17.919" style="s2">across here and so they shaved more of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.030" end="00:03:19.659" style="s2">it and after that I had this weird urge</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.919" end="00:03:21.159" style="s2">that I wanted to shave my entire head</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.659" end="00:03:24.579" style="s2">and I put it off a few months like hey</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.159" end="00:03:29.199" style="s2">wait wait maybe on that one and the urge</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.579" end="00:03:31.299" style="s2">is definitely gone but the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.199" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">between being attracted to someone or</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.299" end="00:03:36.549" style="s2">something that&#39;s something I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:40.259" style="s2">do something be attracted to someone and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.549" end="00:03:43.389" style="s2">realizing how much of that attraction is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.259" end="00:03:46.479" style="s2">that I want to be like them and how much</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.389" end="00:03:48.459" style="s2">is know I want to be me and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.479" end="00:03:51.099" style="s2">that is and I can still be attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.459" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">that and it&#39;s weird because I never felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.099" end="00:03:55.569" style="s2">that way as a heterosexual woman</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:58.509" style="s2">attracted to men I never had the thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.569" end="00:04:01.000" style="s2">like maybe and but realizing how in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.509" end="00:04:03.219" style="s2">life that was absolutely true that I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.000" end="00:04:06.340" style="s2">attracted to well men in male clothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.219" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">and always was annoyed that they got to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.340" end="00:04:10.900" style="s2">you they&#39;re fat a sense of fashion sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.030" style="s2">is easier thrown a t-shirt and jeans</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.900" end="00:04:14.829" style="s2">they&#39;re one like a button-up shirt and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.030" end="00:04:19.690" style="s2">you&#39;re good to go and if I was a man and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.829" end="00:04:22.090" style="s2">I could I would be able to dress better</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.690" end="00:04:24.310" style="s2">and I only just had the Epiphany like</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.090" end="00:04:25.930" style="s2">six seven months ago like wait and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">don&#39;t wouldn&#39;t call it dressing better</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.930" end="00:04:28.810" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:30.669" style="s2">I&#39;m allowed I&#39;m allowed to wear men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.810" end="00:04:32.980" style="s2">what we would call men&#39;s clothing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.669" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">you&#39;ll find it it and so yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.980" end="00:04:36.040" style="s2">something I&#39;m constantly struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:40.540" style="s2">and so I think I&#39;m gonna share more</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.040" end="00:04:45.130" style="s2">about that side of me not just that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.540" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">all of it by realizing I&#39;m queer and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.130" end="00:04:50.830" style="s2">and all of the like beauty and pain and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:54.340" style="s2">craziness the coast with that as well as</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.830" end="00:04:56.889" style="s2">my my health issues my disability past</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.340" end="00:04:58.540" style="s2">and present being a single mom being a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.889" end="00:05:00.490" style="s2">single mom by choice like I think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.540" end="00:05:04.270" style="s2">people are gonna more resonate with my</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.490" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">truth my inner truth and what I want and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.270" end="00:05:08.050" style="s2">don&#39;t want is followers and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:11.350" style="s2">be able to talk about my global</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.050" end="00:05:14.669" style="s2">cooperative but finding a way to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.350" end="00:05:17.229" style="s2">vulnerable and showing who I truly am</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.669" end="00:05:21.250" style="s2">brings people on board in a different</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.229" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">way and as I&#39;m figuring out how to also</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.250" end="00:05:27.790" style="s2">explain it in written form and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">trying to write a book an e-book that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.790" end="00:05:33.100" style="s2">can give away and so yeah balancing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">figuring out what I&#39;m gonna be talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.100" end="00:05:35.940" style="s2">about because I don&#39;t want to stop these</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:37.780" style="s2">hundred day videos I think they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.940" end="00:05:40.360" style="s2">powerful point for me even though no</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.780" end="00:05:42.070" style="s2">one&#39;s watch them but it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.360" end="00:05:44.650" style="s2">that point I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.070" end="00:05:48.010" style="s2">things that feel more vulnerable to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.650" end="00:05:49.570" style="s2">so yeah today is day 14 which is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.010" end="00:05:52.770" style="s2">number since that&#39;s my birthday number</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.570" end="00:05:55.630" style="s2">and it feels alright I missed yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.770" end="00:05:57.850" style="s2">day which would have been day 14 but</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.630" end="00:05:59.950" style="s2">today feels perfect because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.850" end="00:06:02.440" style="s2">31st it&#39;s two years since my brain surge</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.950" end="00:06:06.010" style="s2">or my last my last and hopefully final</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.440" end="00:06:07.990" style="s2">final final brain surgery and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.010" end="00:06:10.419" style="s2">shift it&#39;s the end of a month beginning</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.720" end="00:06:21.810" style="s2">use this channel to be more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.500" end="00:06:21.810" style="s2">and share myself thank you</p>
