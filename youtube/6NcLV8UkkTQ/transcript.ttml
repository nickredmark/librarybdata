<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.460" style="s2">okay I&#39;m about done - okay good</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.089" end="00:00:14.750" style="s2">when the IceMen was discovered in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:18.449" style="s2">austrian alps yet two types of mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.750" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">yeah this mushroom ha Madhu which is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.449" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">firestarter mushroom that enabled humans</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:24.689" style="s2">to migrate into colder environments the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:27.660" style="s2">Woodcock is called the fire starter or</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.689" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">tinder conk because he put embers of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.660" end="00:00:32.579" style="s2">fire in it and carry fire over distances</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">and if your clan needed to have fire to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.579" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">survive and we in Europe we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">winter unusual but if you couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">fire than your clan would die so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.710" end="00:00:44.610" style="s2">fire keeper the tribe was incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">important to human survival and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.610" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">knowledge of keeping fire alive was</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.260" end="00:00:50.969" style="s2">resident in the knowledge of polypore</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:52.469" style="s2">mushrooms especially Amadou which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.969" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">extremely flammable my hat by the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.469" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely flammable you can use the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">fibers and the mycelium to stop fires</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">but he can use the to carry fires right</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s you know the analogy could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:11.970" style="s2">just like you know a piece of wood</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">versus paper you know or whatever so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.970" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">more surface area the more flammable the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">material is so Amadou is one you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:21.990" style="s2">they had he also had the another birch</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">polypore called picked a porous betcha</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">linus and the bootstrap mushroom this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">the only mushroom that I know that will</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">sharpen steel it&#39;s a relatively soft</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">mushroom but when it&#39;s in a ball form</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">you can cut it dry it a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">the Sun it gets leathery and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">actually called the bootstrap mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">because the sharpens steel I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">many mushrooms do you know sharp misdeal</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:45.390" style="s2">this is the and we know about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.189" style="s2">that this sharpest steel from the common</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.390" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">name and translated translated from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.189" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">ancient German so I mean if this</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">mushroom was not called the bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">mushroom I bet you not too many this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">knowledge would not have survived</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:57.869" style="s2">because it linguistically it is survived</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">by Garak on that when I mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.869" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">is called the elixir iam had long and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">vitam 2,000 years ago the elixir of long</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">life and our research now as ironic two</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:11.060" style="s2">thousand years after this mushroom was</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:12.950" style="s2">discovered to be medicinal we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.060" end="00:02:14.540" style="s2">just looking at it for us you know new</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.950" end="00:02:19.940" style="s2">pharmacological activities against</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.540" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">viruses and bacteria how dumb are 2,000</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:23.750" style="s2">years to get around to the subject that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">our ancestors discovered so how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.750" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">other species are there that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">begun to discover so my hope is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:32.450" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a mycelial</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">revolution a revolution in the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">using fungi and one of the my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:39.470" style="s2">the biggest one of the most focused</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:41.030" style="s2">points that I can make is at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.470" end="00:02:43.940" style="s2">University of Washington the Department</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.030" end="00:02:45.230" style="s2">of astrobiology is better funded than</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.940" end="00:02:47.480" style="s2">the Department of mycology</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.230" end="00:02:49.310" style="s2">now I&#39;d like astrobiology I think there</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.480" end="00:02:52.489" style="s2">are organisms in outer space probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:54.290" style="s2">are don&#39;t have any yet but we know in</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.489" end="00:02:55.849" style="s2">the field and on this planet we have one</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.290" end="00:02:57.950" style="s2">the 2 million species of fungi less than</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.849" end="00:03:00.170" style="s2">10% of which have been identified it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.950" end="00:03:02.269" style="s2">seems to me that we have Mis prioritized</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.170" end="00:03:04.099" style="s2">we&#39;ve romanticized the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.269" end="00:03:05.900" style="s2">organisms being out of space while</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.099" end="00:03:07.730" style="s2">ignoring in our very home in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.900" end="00:03:10.190" style="s2">backyard the ecosystems are collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.730" end="00:03:13.160" style="s2">all around us due to our ignorance of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:16.130" style="s2">these fungal entities that are present</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.160" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">within us around us thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.130" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">thank you</p>
