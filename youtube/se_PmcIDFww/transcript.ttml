<p begin="00:00:24.140" end="00:00:28.430" style="s2">i&#39;m with research and development here</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.820" end="00:00:31.160" style="s2">at nirakar collective and we are really</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.430" end="00:00:33.770" style="s2">excited to have dr. Andrew Huberman with</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.160" end="00:00:36.140" style="s2">us today andrew is a professor of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.770" end="00:00:39.379" style="s2">neuroscience neurobiology at Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.140" end="00:00:41.870" style="s2">School of Medicine which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.379" end="00:00:44.539" style="s2">eminent neuroscience centers in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.870" end="00:00:46.699" style="s2">world cutting edge work in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.539" end="00:00:49.780" style="s2">the brain when he and I first met he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.699" end="00:00:53.739" style="s2">at UCSD in the Salk Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.780" end="00:00:57.050" style="s2">transferred a couple years ago up to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.739" end="00:00:58.969" style="s2">Stanford and he also runs the Huberman</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.050" end="00:01:01.519" style="s2">labs which is working on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.969" end="00:01:03.460" style="s2">neuroscience of vision and here&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.519" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">interesting kind of history with</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.460" end="00:01:09.410" style="s2">studying vision and in the neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:12.130" style="s2">of vision and then sensory processing</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.410" end="00:01:16.010" style="s2">and then as a result of that fear has</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.130" end="00:01:18.170" style="s2">really helped develop the neurobiology</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.010" end="00:01:19.970" style="s2">lab at Stanford and the tech there and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.170" end="00:01:22.460" style="s2">they have some really cutting-edge work</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.970" end="00:01:25.160" style="s2">they&#39;re doing with VR and a number of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.460" end="00:01:28.430" style="s2">fun things and so we&#39;re going to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.160" end="00:01:32.600" style="s2">explore today some personal development</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.430" end="00:01:35.240" style="s2">related insights that come from formal</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.600" end="00:01:39.680" style="s2">academic neuroscience and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.240" end="00:01:42.290" style="s2">invite Andrew to be a little bit free to</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.680" end="00:01:44.180" style="s2">be more speculative regarding what an</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.290" end="00:01:46.520" style="s2">animal trial or an early human trial</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.180" end="00:01:48.500" style="s2">might actually say down the road and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.520" end="00:01:51.140" style="s2">where these insights are likely going</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.500" end="00:01:54.440" style="s2">then he probably gets to be in formal</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.140" end="00:01:56.990" style="s2">paper publication and Andrew thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.440" end="00:01:59.570" style="s2">for being here Thank You Daniel I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.990" end="00:02:02.330" style="s2">delighted to be here first of all I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.570" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">tremendous respect for what you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.330" end="00:02:07.340" style="s2">doing at the neuro hacker collective and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:09.170" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful to see how much things</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.340" end="00:02:11.960" style="s2">have progressed in the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.170" end="00:02:15.500" style="s2">years and I&#39;m sure the is still to come</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.960" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">I enjoyed a lot of our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.500" end="00:02:23.390" style="s2">Science and Technology and looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.400" end="00:02:26.030" style="s2">forward to looking forward to more one</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.390" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">fun thing about Andrew is that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.030" end="00:02:32.180" style="s2">addition to being you know an academic</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:34.790" style="s2">researcher of the brain from a you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.180" end="00:02:37.850" style="s2">third-person science perspective he also</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.790" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">has a long history with extreme sports</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.850" end="00:02:43.400" style="s2">with bodybuilding with you know various</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">athletics and with the nutrition and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.400" end="00:02:49.400" style="s2">biochemistry and biohacking that goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">along with that and some fun things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.400" end="00:02:53.060" style="s2">he&#39;ll share here and personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:54.920" style="s2">development so he&#39;s got a first-person</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.060" end="00:02:57.500" style="s2">experience and third-person knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.920" end="00:03:00.290" style="s2">the field so we we have a fun bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.500" end="00:03:02.240" style="s2">areas that we can cover so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:05.300" style="s2">would I would love if we could just</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.240" end="00:03:06.980" style="s2">start with talk about fear a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.300" end="00:03:09.830" style="s2">and the work that you guys have done in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.980" end="00:03:12.190" style="s2">fear and specifically the fight flight</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.830" end="00:03:14.540" style="s2">freeze responses the differences in them</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.190" end="00:03:17.750" style="s2">courage a little bit about we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.540" end="00:03:20.930" style="s2">there because it is one of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.750" end="00:03:22.280" style="s2">deepest experiences for all mammals</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.930" end="00:03:24.709" style="s2">obviously and for humans and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.280" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">cripples people the most and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.709" end="00:03:27.410" style="s2">the presence of fear there are some</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.970" end="00:03:28.730" style="s2">people that will be crippled than others</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.410" end="00:03:29.900" style="s2">it won&#39;t be crippled by it there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.730" end="00:03:31.820" style="s2">insights that I think you guys are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.900" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">very cutting edge of learning regarding</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.820" end="00:03:34.180" style="s2">this which is critical for everyone so</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.230" end="00:03:39.440" style="s2">talk to us about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.180" end="00:03:42.590" style="s2">sure so before I start I just have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.440" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">say I&#39;m I I&#39;m smiling because you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.590" end="00:03:45.560" style="s2">mentioned experience with body weight</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.720" style="s2">definitely with extreme sports and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.560" end="00:03:48.890" style="s2">martial arts I guess I could probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:51.070" style="s2">say that I&#39;m one of the larger</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.890" end="00:03:54.140" style="s2">neuroscientists out there but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.070" end="00:03:57.440" style="s2">I just I got involved in resistance</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.140" end="00:03:58.790" style="s2">training and fitness pretty young for</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.440" end="00:04:02.930" style="s2">reasons that we can get into later is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.790" end="00:04:06.830" style="s2">that I kind of relate to fear and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.930" end="00:04:08.780" style="s2">just been struck at how quickly the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.830" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">world of physical augmentation has</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.780" end="00:04:11.660" style="s2">evolved not just in strength training</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.340" end="00:04:14.390" style="s2">but in other areas of physical</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.660" end="00:04:17.540" style="s2">augmentation and how what there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.390" end="00:04:19.340" style="s2">this lag into a cognitive and neural</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.540" end="00:04:20.330" style="s2">augmentation but now I think we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.340" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">the area where we&#39;re really going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.330" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">catch up so once it gets you a question</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:28.669" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s so right so my</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:31.219" style="s2">laboratory has two winnings to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.669" end="00:04:32.930" style="s2">wing of the laboratory meaning some</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.219" end="00:04:34.490" style="s2">people and some physical space there</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.930" end="00:04:36.499" style="s2">devotes understanding how to repair the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.490" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">nervous system after injury and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.499" end="00:04:39.979" style="s2">something I&#39;ve been mainly focusing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:41.930" style="s2">visual system to prevent and cure</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.979" end="00:04:43.669" style="s2">blinding diseases like glaucoma that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.930" end="00:04:46.719" style="s2">still a very active area pursuit for us</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.669" end="00:04:49.879" style="s2">the other half of the lab is working on</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.719" end="00:04:52.009" style="s2">things like why are certain visual</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.879" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">stimuli why are certain visual events</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.009" end="00:04:58.219" style="s2">scary why do they suddenly trigger a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">limbic response if you will that puts</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.219" end="00:05:02.120" style="s2">people into a state of anxiety and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">also studying at what I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.120" end="00:05:06.050" style="s2">really interesting table is a new area</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:08.539" style="s2">for us what we&#39;re calling visual empathy</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.050" end="00:05:11.389" style="s2">or primal empathy which is the sensation</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.539" end="00:05:13.969" style="s2">of of an emotion by virtue of what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.389" end="00:05:16.879" style="s2">see somebody else experiencing visually</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.969" end="00:05:18.529" style="s2">and that&#39;s and so so just briefly we got</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.879" end="00:05:20.629" style="s2">into fear and my interest in fear</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.529" end="00:05:22.669" style="s2">primarily because we&#39;re search of visual</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.629" end="00:05:24.349" style="s2">animals I mean more than 40% of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.669" end="00:05:26.870" style="s2">human brain is devoted to vision we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.349" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">really traded out olfaction and chemical</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.870" end="00:05:31.879" style="s2">sensing of things in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:33.409" style="s2">through our noses for vision some people</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.879" end="00:05:35.479" style="s2">are also depend on their auditory</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.409" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">systems a lot but we&#39;re so visually</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.479" end="00:05:39.529" style="s2">driven so most of what I&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:42.319" style="s2">is visual fear I&#39;ve been asked what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.529" end="00:05:44.120" style="s2">fear you know there aren&#39;t great</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.319" end="00:05:46.610" style="s2">operational definitions for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.120" end="00:05:49.430" style="s2">these things but to me fear is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.610" end="00:05:52.339" style="s2">negative sensation in the body for which</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.430" end="00:05:53.990" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know what to do in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.339" end="00:05:55.669" style="s2">order to alleviate it so if you you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.990" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">if I take a sip of this drink you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.669" end="00:05:59.240" style="s2">which is tea and then you say oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:01.580" style="s2">you didn&#39;t take a sip of that drink did</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.240" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">you and I said why why what why not is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.580" end="00:06:05.870" style="s2">it what&#39;s wrong with it you say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">poison you got 15 minutes to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.870" end="00:06:09.439" style="s2">hospital and that&#39;s I&#39;m gonna be scared</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:10.819" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be anxious I&#39;m gonna you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.439" end="00:06:12.379" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s you telling me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.819" end="00:06:15.110" style="s2">because you&#39;re not somebody to to play</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.379" end="00:06:16.879" style="s2">games like that you know and then we of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.110" end="00:06:18.259" style="s2">course have you know the writers have</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.879" end="00:06:19.699" style="s2">described fear in a couple different</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.259" end="00:06:21.649" style="s2">ways interesting with Stephen King I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.699" end="00:06:24.169" style="s2">think it was the one who said there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.649" end="00:06:26.360" style="s2">there&#39;s dread the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.169" end="00:06:29.089" style="s2">worried about happening there&#39;s terror</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.360" end="00:06:31.339" style="s2">there&#39;s like some as it happens and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.089" end="00:06:32.990" style="s2">there&#39;s horror which is that after the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.339" end="00:06:34.490" style="s2">event the kind of the replay in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.990" end="00:06:35.750" style="s2">mind that that was horrible it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.490" end="00:06:37.610" style="s2">horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.750" end="00:06:39.050" style="s2">you know that&#39;s some of semantics and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.610" end="00:06:40.339" style="s2">it&#39;s relates to language and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.050" end="00:06:41.990" style="s2">probably different across cultures but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.339" end="00:06:43.880" style="s2">like that because</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.990" end="00:06:45.770" style="s2">they all encapsulate something very</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.880" end="00:06:48.980" style="s2">important which is that they that all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.770" end="00:06:50.540" style="s2">fear involves kind of a negative arousal</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.980" end="00:06:53.810" style="s2">like an arousal that you wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.540" end="00:06:57.140" style="s2">to have and so my laboratory a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.810" end="00:06:59.060" style="s2">years ago we decided when I say we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.140" end="00:07:00.470" style="s2">really a spectacular graduate student in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.060" end="00:07:01.820" style="s2">the neuroscience program then it used</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.470" end="00:07:03.370" style="s2">TST who is now in the neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.820" end="00:07:06.140" style="s2">program at Stanford Lindsey Salette</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.370" end="00:07:08.420" style="s2">started using you know the typical</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.140" end="00:07:09.800" style="s2">animal animal model for us is mice but</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.420" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">we also will now work in humans and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.800" end="00:07:14.120" style="s2">have clinical trials of humans from</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:17.300" style="s2">through my lab and um what-what Lindsey</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.120" end="00:07:19.190" style="s2">did was a really simple experiment where</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.300" end="00:07:21.320" style="s2">she took a mouse put in a little box and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.190" end="00:07:24.380" style="s2">then showed it an overhead expanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.320" end="00:07:26.810" style="s2">black disc which to the mouse we think</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.380" end="00:07:28.580" style="s2">appears something like a predator coming</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.810" end="00:07:31.100" style="s2">in to eat it and when you do that too</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.580" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">for a mouse it has one of two responses</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.100" end="00:07:38.420" style="s2">either freezes I mean just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:41.420" style="s2">stone-cold freezes or it runs and hides</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.420" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">in a shelter if it can and that itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.420" end="00:07:45.950" style="s2">is interesting because we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:48.140" style="s2">fight or flight but actually a fight</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.950" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">response to something scary is very rare</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.140" end="00:07:53.090" style="s2">in an animal typically an animal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:54.680" style="s2">scared will will freeze or run so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.090" end="00:07:56.750" style="s2">think we need to start to rethink even</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:07:59.570" style="s2">though I&#39;m most basic kind of um you</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.750" end="00:08:02.270" style="s2">know cultural understanding of what fear</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.570" end="00:08:06.070" style="s2">really induces it&#39;s gonna be freeze or</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.270" end="00:08:10.640" style="s2">run the next really critical discovery</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.070" end="00:08:13.250" style="s2">was scream the brain of these animals</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.640" end="00:08:14.780" style="s2">that were scared and she asked in a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.250" end="00:08:16.940" style="s2">unbiased ways what are the brain areas</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.780" end="00:08:19.610" style="s2">that are activated and she identified in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.940" end="00:08:21.290" style="s2">this that region of the of the central</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.610" end="00:08:22.460" style="s2">brain it&#39;s called the xiphoid nucleus</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.290" end="00:08:24.350" style="s2">very few people have known about it I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.460" end="00:08:26.660" style="s2">teach her anatomy to medical students I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.350" end="00:08:28.010" style="s2">did that at UCSD I do that Stanford and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.660" end="00:08:29.990" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even know where this nucleus</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.010" end="00:08:32.090" style="s2">was since right in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.990" end="00:08:34.190" style="s2">brain right in the center and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.090" end="00:08:35.930" style="s2">nucleus is very interesting because it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.190" end="00:08:37.910" style="s2">connects two areas of the forebrain</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.930" end="00:08:39.350" style="s2">involved in thinking in areas of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.910" end="00:08:41.960" style="s2">brain like the amygdala which your mold</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.350" end="00:08:43.370" style="s2">and threat detection it also connects to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.960" end="00:08:46.520" style="s2">reward centers in the brain and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.370" end="00:08:47.990" style="s2">come back to that so here&#39;s this area</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.520" end="00:08:48.620" style="s2">that seems to be involved in the fear</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.990" end="00:08:51.110" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.620" end="00:08:54.170" style="s2">and so then Lindsey when and used some</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.110" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">genetic tricks which allowed her to turn</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.170" end="00:08:57.230" style="s2">on and off or increase</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:08:58.580" style="s2">or decrease the activity of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.230" end="00:09:00.710" style="s2">structure while the animal was</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.580" end="00:09:02.990" style="s2">experiencing fear and what she saw was</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.710" end="00:09:05.180" style="s2">really remarkable what she saw was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.990" end="00:09:08.330" style="s2">mice that were once afraid of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.180" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">overhead looming object by freezing</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.330" end="00:09:14.150" style="s2">we told us they were afraid by freezing</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:15.950" style="s2">or running suddenly would ignore it or</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.150" end="00:09:17.900" style="s2">would even confront it maybe even try</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.950" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">and rattle their tail which for a mouse</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.900" end="00:09:23.210" style="s2">as an aggressive response that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:25.580" style="s2">incredible in its own right because here</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.210" end="00:09:28.310" style="s2">you know she discovered a brain area in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.580" end="00:09:30.440" style="s2">that very you know it&#39;s reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.310" end="00:09:32.570" style="s2">assume at least play some important role</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.440" end="00:09:35.720" style="s2">in regulating the behavioral response to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.570" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">fear or what we call the level of threat</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.720" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">that or risk that the animal will</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.670" end="00:09:40.520" style="s2">tolerate right because we can&#39;t we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:43.940" style="s2">ask them house what it feels but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.520" end="00:09:46.340" style="s2">not gonna tell us so but what we do know</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.940" end="00:09:47.720" style="s2">what we can measure is how much risk</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.340" end="00:09:49.730" style="s2">that animal will tolerate when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.720" end="00:09:51.290" style="s2">stimulate this brain area and then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.730" end="00:09:51.980" style="s2">the fourth element that was really</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.290" end="00:09:53.630" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.980" end="00:09:55.880" style="s2">fourth discovery in this is she said</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.630" end="00:09:57.500" style="s2">whoa what&#39;s going on is it something</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.880" end="00:10:00.110" style="s2">that has to is the activation in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.500" end="00:10:02.120" style="s2">brain area have to be coincide with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.110" end="00:10:03.860" style="s2">the delivery of this fear stimulus and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.120" end="00:10:05.840" style="s2">turns out it doesn&#39;t she could increase</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.860" end="00:10:08.260" style="s2">the activity of this structure the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.840" end="00:10:11.000" style="s2">xiphoid nucleus and then present animals</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.260" end="00:10:12.770" style="s2">with a scary situation and they would</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.000" end="00:10:15.050" style="s2">confront it they would go from fear to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.770" end="00:10:17.000" style="s2">courage if you will and that told us</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.050" end="00:10:20.120" style="s2">something really essential which is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.000" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">so much of what we think about in terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.120" end="00:10:25.010" style="s2">of our response to fear or our level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:27.590" style="s2">risk tones is really a state it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.010" end="00:10:28.910" style="s2">state throughout the body it&#39;s a state</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.590" end="00:10:30.740" style="s2">that&#39;s throughout the brain it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.910" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">systemic effect it&#39;s not just gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.740" end="00:10:35.060" style="s2">the activation of one brain area okay so</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:37.970" style="s2">that was all fine and good and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.060" end="00:10:39.620" style="s2">excited and those data are been written</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.970" end="00:10:41.000" style="s2">up and have been submitted and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.620" end="00:10:42.770" style="s2">we wrapped up and published in early</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.000" end="00:10:46.910" style="s2">2018 things were looking good for that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.770" end="00:10:49.970" style="s2">you know Malcolm would and but in</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.910" end="00:10:54.200" style="s2">parallel to all that we set up our</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.970" end="00:10:55.910" style="s2">laboratory where and this was a postdoc</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.200" end="00:10:57.740" style="s2">by the name of Malia illness who had</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.910" end="00:11:00.260" style="s2">come to us from Harvard and then Caltech</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.740" end="00:11:02.150" style="s2">really tremendously a talented postdoc</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.260" end="00:11:03.800" style="s2">and she said you know all the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.150" end="00:11:05.000" style="s2">we&#39;re doing in mice if she done similar</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.800" end="00:11:07.550" style="s2">work in my sister and her graduate work</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.000" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">she said I want to build a box just like</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.550" end="00:11:11.700" style="s2">that but for Hugh</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:13.140" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what we did we took you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.700" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">know this is arguably one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.140" end="00:11:17.970" style="s2">state-of-the-art human performance or</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.550" style="s2">human behavior labs to study fear in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.970" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">world it&#39;s about a million a half bucks</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.550" end="00:11:23.910" style="s2">to build a this laboratory where</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:26.370" style="s2">essentially you put a human in there</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.910" end="00:11:28.890" style="s2">they put on VR goggles I&#39;ll say why VR</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.370" end="00:11:30.870" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got motion tracking for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.890" end="00:11:33.300" style="s2">body we&#39;re measuring heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.870" end="00:11:35.100" style="s2">breathing sweating we&#39;re also measuring</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.300" end="00:11:37.650" style="s2">pupil imagery how big the pupils are</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.100" end="00:11:40.080" style="s2">which is a very fast autonomic readout</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.650" end="00:11:43.980" style="s2">of a readout of autonomic activity or</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.080" end="00:11:46.710" style="s2">arousal and so we then took it upon</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.980" end="00:11:48.660" style="s2">ourselves to go out and collect the e60</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.710" end="00:11:53.010" style="s2">video of different fear inducing</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.660" end="00:11:54.360" style="s2">scenarios attack dogs Heights great</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.010" end="00:11:56.490" style="s2">white sharks we can talk about great</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:59.310" style="s2">white sharks some real-world fear some</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.490" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">real-world you know I wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.310" end="00:12:03.330" style="s2">terrifying buts pretty scary stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:05.250" style="s2">brought that back to the lab and then in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.330" end="00:12:07.830" style="s2">VR you can you can get about as close to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.250" end="00:12:09.330" style="s2">the real world as possible in humans and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.830" end="00:12:11.280" style="s2">then measure their fear responses either</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.330" end="00:12:12.780" style="s2">through these non-invasive things like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.280" end="00:12:14.190" style="s2">just described tools like I just</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.780" end="00:12:15.780" style="s2">described but we&#39;ve also done</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.190" end="00:12:17.400" style="s2">experiments in collaboration with my</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.780" end="00:12:19.860" style="s2">friend Eddie Chang as a neurosurgeon at</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.400" end="00:12:21.510" style="s2">UCSF we actually had patients with</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.860" end="00:12:24.330" style="s2">electrodes embedded down through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.510" end="00:12:26.640" style="s2">skull into the human amygdala while</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.330" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">watching these 360 experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.640" end="00:12:30.870" style="s2">sharks and whatnot and can measure the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.980" end="00:12:32.550" style="s2">neural signals that occur so we now have</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.870" end="00:12:34.230" style="s2">this parallel platform of doing studies</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.550" end="00:12:36.570" style="s2">in the mouse and prepend studies in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.230" end="00:12:38.610" style="s2">unit and this is where something really</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.570" end="00:12:41.940" style="s2">exciting comes up first of all we now</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.610" end="00:12:45.450" style="s2">believe that fight is a separate</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.940" end="00:12:47.100" style="s2">response that&#39;s distinct from the fight</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.450" end="00:12:49.470" style="s2">from the scuse me that fight is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.100" end="00:12:51.750" style="s2">distinct response from the freeze or</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.470" end="00:12:54.090" style="s2">flee response that fight may not</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.750" end="00:12:55.860" style="s2">actually be on the fear axis then it</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.090" end="00:12:57.270" style="s2">might that fight-or-flight isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.860" end="00:12:58.200" style="s2">necessarily the way it works you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.270" end="00:12:59.190" style="s2">people always think if you get scared</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.200" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">enough you get backed into a corner</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.190" end="00:13:04.230" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna fight that might be true</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">but there&#39;s another axis in which people</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.230" end="00:13:09.750" style="s2">select to confront scary things and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:11.850" style="s2">cool thing is there&#39;s a study that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.750" end="00:13:14.130" style="s2">published in the sixties to patients</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.850" end="00:13:16.650" style="s2">they can stimulate any area of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.130" end="00:13:18.630" style="s2">that they want including a region that</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.650" end="00:13:20.100" style="s2">corresponds to the xiphoid nucleus in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.630" end="00:13:22.170" style="s2">the mouse this is the central median</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.100" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">nucleus of the thalamus and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.170" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">for the aficionados or if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:29.160" style="s2">look it up this is a paper from Heath</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:30.810" style="s2">1963 and published in science and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.160" end="00:13:32.190" style="s2">these people can stimulate anywhere they</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.810" end="00:13:34.649" style="s2">want areas of the brain that stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.190" end="00:13:36.180" style="s2">sexual arousal the feeling of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.649" end="00:13:37.290" style="s2">that they&#39;re a little bit drunk all</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.180" end="00:13:38.610" style="s2">these different brain areas they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.290" end="00:13:40.110" style="s2">stimulate and they can because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.610" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">humans they can report what they feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.110" end="00:13:44.760" style="s2">the number one brain area now it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:46.230" style="s2">two patients but the number one area</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.760" end="00:13:48.149" style="s2">that these two people want to hit the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.230" end="00:13:50.779" style="s2">lever on all the time so to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.149" end="00:13:52.740" style="s2">stimulate is this area of the brain that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.779" end="00:13:54.360" style="s2">corresponds to the same nucleus that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.740" end="00:13:56.970" style="s2">Lyndsey was studying in mice that shift</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.360" end="00:13:58.740" style="s2">them from fear to courage or from higher</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.970" end="00:14:01.110" style="s2">or to higher levels of risk tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.740" end="00:14:04.380" style="s2">and the subjective feeling that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.110" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">experience is one of mild frustration</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.380" end="00:14:08.610" style="s2">and kind of effort and I find that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.829" style="s2">incredible what it says is that there</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.610" end="00:14:15.089" style="s2">might be something innately rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.829" end="00:14:18.180" style="s2">about wanting to challenge fears or</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.089" end="00:14:19.560" style="s2">challenge the confront things and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.180" end="00:14:21.329" style="s2">know we&#39;ve taken upon ourselves to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.560" end="00:14:22.889" style="s2">that fear is a bad thing and stress is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.329" end="00:14:24.149" style="s2">bad thing and now there&#39;s some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.889" end="00:14:25.290" style="s2">coming out about stress maybe being</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.149" end="00:14:27.329" style="s2">positive depending on how you interpret</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.290" end="00:14:30.120" style="s2">the event that is in our work but other</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.329" end="00:14:32.370" style="s2">work and I find it so interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.120" end="00:14:33.690" style="s2">as humans so much of what drove our</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.370" end="00:14:39.720" style="s2">evolution was the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.690" end="00:14:41.850" style="s2">confront fear and take on us and here</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.720" end="00:14:44.550" style="s2">now again we&#39;re seeing these brain areas</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.850" end="00:14:46.709" style="s2">that people work they&#39;ll actually work</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.550" end="00:14:49.050" style="s2">in order to stimulate these brain areas</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.709" end="00:14:50.699" style="s2">just like mice will and so I&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.050" end="00:14:52.260" style="s2">long-winded on this answer but I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.699" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">what I&#39;d like the listeners to take away</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.260" end="00:14:55.860" style="s2">is that fight or flight is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:59.220" style="s2">misnomer that the fight access is</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.860" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">probably a distinct thing and that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.220" end="00:15:04.440" style="s2">fear response has a lot more to do with</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:06.029" style="s2">a state in your body and brain then it</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.440" end="00:15:07.170" style="s2">does have to do with something</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.029" end="00:15:09.300" style="s2">fundamental about your neural</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.170" end="00:15:12.029" style="s2">architecture it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.300" end="00:15:14.010" style="s2">that you&#39;re a scaredy cat it means that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.029" end="00:15:15.810" style="s2">and what it points to is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.010" end="00:15:17.959" style="s2">if we can control state if we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.810" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">manipulate state in a very dedicated way</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.959" end="00:15:23.010" style="s2">that we stand a chance to really involve</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:25.560" style="s2">our species through higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.010" end="00:15:27.149" style="s2">healthy risk tolerance or higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.560" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">of risk tolerance where payoffs might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.149" end="00:15:33.959" style="s2">advantageous okay so I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:35.640" style="s2">is one of the most meaningful areas of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.959" end="00:15:37.200" style="s2">what it portends for</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.640" end="00:15:40.050" style="s2">human possibility in human development</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.200" end="00:15:44.130" style="s2">so I want to go deeper into several</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.050" end="00:15:44.850" style="s2">aspects of the physiology so first when</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.130" end="00:15:46.410" style="s2">you said that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.850" end="00:15:50.040" style="s2">inherently rewarding about confronting</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.410" end="00:15:52.110" style="s2">fear so you know we start to think of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.040" end="00:15:54.779" style="s2">hormesis effect right that when you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.110" end="00:15:56.430" style="s2">some stress on an adaptive system that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.779" end="00:15:57.779" style="s2">it increases the adaptive capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.430" end="00:15:59.370" style="s2">the system and if you don&#39;t stress an</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.779" end="00:16:01.350" style="s2">adaptive system then it decreases its</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.370" end="00:16:03.540" style="s2">capacity because there&#39;s no benefit in</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.350" end="00:16:06.570" style="s2">keeping it so we know that with exercise</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.540" end="00:16:09.779" style="s2">and we know it with cold tolerance like</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.570" end="00:16:11.579" style="s2">wim HOF work that you did but also when</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.779" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">someone confronts a stress that they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.579" end="00:16:15.899" style="s2">actually adapt to increase their</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">capacity to handle they become a human</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.899" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">with more capacity if there&#39;s a stress</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:21.300" style="s2">that they can&#39;t increase their capacity</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:23.070" style="s2">to handle then it just becomes strain</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.300" end="00:16:24.300" style="s2">and damages the system right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.070" end="00:16:25.950" style="s2">just like if you lift an amount of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.300" end="00:16:28.589" style="s2">weight to just rips muscles that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.950" end="00:16:30.120" style="s2">build muscle so fear we can imagine has</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.589" end="00:16:32.760" style="s2">a similar thing right which is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.120" end="00:16:35.190" style="s2">ability to confront a level of fear that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.760" end="00:16:38.040" style="s2">we actually can process as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.190" end="00:16:39.630" style="s2">just become frozen and you know crippled</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.040" end="00:16:41.100" style="s2">with and the in doing so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.630" end="00:16:43.019" style="s2">increasing our capacity and that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.100" end="00:16:45.180" style="s2">there is a developmental reward around</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.019" end="00:16:47.970" style="s2">capacity increasing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.180" end="00:16:50.579" style="s2">so then the question I have has to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.970" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">with maybe speculations on the chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.579" end="00:16:55.850" style="s2">of this because you said not just the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:58.709" style="s2">xiphoid nucleus but the entire</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.850" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">physiology and state so when we think of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.709" end="00:17:04.530" style="s2">fear and we think of threat detection we</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:06.750" style="s2">typically think of you know decreased</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.530" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">heart rate variability increase</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.750" end="00:17:10.470" style="s2">sympathetic response decrease</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.220" end="00:17:11.910" style="s2">parasympathetic and then chemically we</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.470" end="00:17:15.240" style="s2">think of increased adrenal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.910" end="00:17:17.610" style="s2">hormones and an acceleration of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.240" end="00:17:20.699" style="s2">catecholamines converting from dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.610" end="00:17:22.620" style="s2">norepinephrine epinephrine faster right</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.699" end="00:17:24.750" style="s2">kind of roughly yeah we had in when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.620" end="00:17:28.370" style="s2">think of reward we think of more</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.750" end="00:17:31.559" style="s2">dopamine and dopamine opioid dynamics so</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.370" end="00:17:34.110" style="s2">is there something maybe where instead</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.559" end="00:17:37.350" style="s2">of dopamine can converting more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.110" end="00:17:40.169" style="s2">into norepinephrine and epinephrine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.350" end="00:17:42.500" style="s2">actually staying as dopamine and may be</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.169" end="00:17:45.150" style="s2">interacting with the opioids or</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.500" end="00:17:46.650" style="s2">endorphins is it have you guys started</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.150" end="00:17:49.490" style="s2">to explore what the chemistry of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.650" end="00:17:51.559" style="s2">might be yeah so we haven&#39;t dealt</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.490" end="00:17:53.780" style="s2">deeply into the underlying chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.559" end="00:17:56.540" style="s2">right now we&#39;ve mainly been focused on</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.780" end="00:17:58.520" style="s2">trying to parse the neural circuitry so</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.540" end="00:18:00.710" style="s2">really trying to identify you know these</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.520" end="00:18:03.160" style="s2">brain areas that are involved in these</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.710" end="00:18:05.750" style="s2">so let&#39;s say call it the behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.160" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">response to fear and the level of risk</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.750" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">tolerance because it&#39;s very you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:11.059" style="s2">actually one thing I&#39;d like to move</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:12.590" style="s2">toward eventually we don&#39;t have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.059" end="00:18:14.030" style="s2">in this conversation of course is that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.590" end="00:18:15.559" style="s2">think it&#39;s gonna be very hard to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.030" end="00:18:18.620" style="s2">about emotions in any kind of objective</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.559" end="00:18:20.660" style="s2">way it&#39;s hard to really know you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.620" end="00:18:22.550" style="s2">how one feels I mean I can guess that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.660" end="00:18:24.590" style="s2">you feel ok but that&#39;s an a value that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.550" end="00:18:26.630" style="s2">a valuation I don&#39;t really know what</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.590" end="00:18:29.150" style="s2">happy is to you or happy as to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.630" end="00:18:30.710" style="s2">very subjective but we can in a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.150" end="00:18:33.530" style="s2">reasonable way start to think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.710" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">measuring states in an objective way so</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.530" end="00:18:37.940" style="s2">what you&#39;re bring up is really</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:39.320" style="s2">interesting you know arousal different</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.940" end="00:18:41.660" style="s2">kinds of arousal there&#39;s a stress</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.320" end="00:18:43.280" style="s2">response there&#39;s sexual arousal there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.660" end="00:18:45.770" style="s2">arousal that&#39;s excitement if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.280" end="00:18:47.510" style="s2">looking forward to an event a movie or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.770" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">concert or time with particular people</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.510" end="00:18:51.470" style="s2">for instance and of course you can blend</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:54.260" style="s2">all those things too but the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.470" end="00:18:57.500" style="s2">interesting thing is that from a pure a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.260" end="00:19:00.290" style="s2">purely neural standpoint it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.500" end="00:19:02.870" style="s2">to imagine that the neurochemical milieu</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.290" end="00:19:05.150" style="s2">that underlies arousal is gonna be that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.870" end="00:19:07.850" style="s2">much different for a scary event versus</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.150" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">a an event that you want to be there for</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.850" end="00:19:15.020" style="s2">for this I&#39;m gonna steal a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:17.270" style="s2">anecdote from my good friend and and now</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.020" end="00:19:18.800" style="s2">business partner Brian Mackenzie who</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.270" end="00:19:20.360" style="s2">some of you might know he&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.800" end="00:19:21.920" style="s2">number of Tim Ferriss his books for his</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.360" end="00:19:23.660" style="s2">work on running and extreme performance</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.920" end="00:19:26.990" style="s2">Brian and I doing a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.660" end="00:19:28.460" style="s2">applied breath work now and implied use</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.990" end="00:19:29.990" style="s2">of the visual system in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.460" end="00:19:32.929" style="s2">breath work for controlling fear states</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.990" end="00:19:35.690" style="s2">but Brian tells it like this so you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.929" end="00:19:37.700" style="s2">but the classic example the lion taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.690" end="00:19:41.150" style="s2">out but you know taking off in pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.700" end="00:19:45.020" style="s2">of its prey and let&#39;s say an antelope or</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.150" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">some other grazing animal and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.020" end="00:19:49.100" style="s2">from a physiological standpoint there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:51.170" style="s2">adrenaline in their systems there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.100" end="00:19:53.059" style="s2">glucose is being shuttled to the muscles</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.170" end="00:19:55.640" style="s2">you know the pupils are dilated it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.059" end="00:19:58.550" style="s2">systems go it&#39;s you know it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.640" end="00:20:00.230" style="s2">it&#39;s on and both animals are really in</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.550" end="00:20:02.300" style="s2">this heightened state of arousal that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.230" end="00:20:03.170" style="s2">you can say for sure but there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.300" end="00:20:05.240" style="s2">one difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.170" end="00:20:09.410" style="s2">which is the lion actually wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.240" end="00:20:11.900" style="s2">there for the lion the the loss or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.410" end="00:20:14.030" style="s2">or that failure to catch its prey means</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.900" end="00:20:16.790" style="s2">it can just go try again and for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.030" end="00:20:20.420" style="s2">antelope the loss you know the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.790" end="00:20:21.980" style="s2">that battle it&#39;s over and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.420" end="00:20:23.810" style="s2">really you start to think about human</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.980" end="00:20:26.690" style="s2">behavior and you start to think a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.810" end="00:20:28.730" style="s2">bit about how the arousal response is</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.690" end="00:20:31.910" style="s2">generated and neurochemically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.730" end="00:20:33.710" style="s2">pretty generic then as humans of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.910" end="00:20:36.200" style="s2">you have this forebrain that super</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.710" end="00:20:37.400" style="s2">imposes meaning on what just happened so</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.200" end="00:20:39.800" style="s2">what maybe we&#39;ll get into this a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.400" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">bit later but you know I&#39;ve decided to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.800" end="00:20:43.550" style="s2">put myself at various points in my life</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:44.630" style="s2">into some pretty high stress scenario</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.550" end="00:20:46.460" style="s2">certainly not the most stressful</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.630" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">scenarios that are available but some</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.460" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">pretty high stress physically</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.680" style="s2">threatening scenarios like caged exit</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">diving with white sharks and things like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.680" end="00:20:58.220" style="s2">that because I believe that if it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.070" end="00:21:01.430" style="s2">with a certain amount of you know risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.220" end="00:21:02.840" style="s2">control and you understand the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.430" end="00:21:05.570" style="s2">contingencies and there&#39;s some skills</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.840" end="00:21:08.270" style="s2">involved that there&#39;s great growth in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.570" end="00:21:10.010" style="s2">those in those experiences the same way</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.270" end="00:21:11.330" style="s2">that mountain climbers feel that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:12.680" style="s2">great growth in climbing mountains I</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.330" end="00:21:13.970" style="s2">don&#39;t think they climb mountains just</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.680" end="00:21:15.020" style="s2">because they&#39;re there or why do they</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.970" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">climb them because they&#39;re there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.020" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">think so I think that humans want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">climb mountains because they want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:24.920" style="s2">take on challenges neurochemically I</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:27.020" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna parse different but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.920" end="00:21:29.690" style="s2">must be that the dopamine system is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.020" end="00:21:31.040" style="s2">involved at some level I believe that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.690" end="00:21:32.540" style="s2">must be that the adrenal system is</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.040" end="00:21:34.310" style="s2">involved in some level just based on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.540" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">readouts that we see in humans and in</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.310" end="00:21:37.970" style="s2">mice this expansion of the pupils which</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:40.760" style="s2">is what happens under heightened state</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.970" end="00:21:42.920" style="s2">of arousal the opioid system might be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.760" end="00:21:44.840" style="s2">is an interesting system it&#39;s a harder</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.920" end="00:21:46.160" style="s2">one for us to parse so I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.840" end="00:21:47.900" style="s2">danced around an answer we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.160" end="00:21:50.540" style="s2">looked at this deeply we will get there</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.900" end="00:21:52.090" style="s2">the mechanistic work is gonna come in</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.540" end="00:21:54.920" style="s2">the fall at least out of experiments</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.090" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">nowadays it&#39;s straightforward thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.920" end="00:21:58.460" style="s2">the beautiful work of my colleague</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">called I saw at Stanford who developed</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.460" end="00:22:03.380" style="s2">channel options and ed Boyden who was at</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">Stanford ethno nifty light control over</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.380" end="00:22:07.970" style="s2">neurons chemical control over neurons</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:11.150" style="s2">and specific neurons that the next set</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">of experiments that Lindsay and to do is</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.150" end="00:22:14.890" style="s2">to tickle just the neurons say in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:16.840" style="s2">opioid pathway</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.890" end="00:22:20.110" style="s2">that project out of reunions it&#39;s got oh</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.840" end="00:22:23.680" style="s2">sorry out of die for unions it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.110" end="00:22:26.200" style="s2">interesting that this area of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.680" end="00:22:29.800" style="s2">is also chock-a-block full of oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.200" end="00:22:31.450" style="s2">receptors and so I&#39;ll just take that as</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.800" end="00:22:33.280" style="s2">an opportunity to say that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.450" end="00:22:36.010" style="s2">the more generic conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.280" end="00:22:37.270" style="s2">dopamine norepinephrine oxytocin and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.010" end="00:22:38.890" style="s2">serotonin they&#39;ve been kind of out there</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.270" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">in the general public are gonna start to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.890" end="00:22:41.500" style="s2">become more nuanced because of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.270" end="00:22:43.750" style="s2">all these neurotransmitters and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.500" end="00:22:45.420" style="s2">neuromodulators are doing different</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.750" end="00:22:48.760" style="s2">things in different neural structures</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.420" end="00:22:50.770" style="s2">and I it gets into a deep conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.760" end="00:22:52.810" style="s2">about how the brain works and that still</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.770" end="00:22:54.810" style="s2">much of what we don&#39;t understand about</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.810" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">how the brain works but we&#39;ll get there</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.810" end="00:22:59.590" style="s2">but I find it interesting that arousal</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:02.800" style="s2">is associated with all these stakes both</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.590" end="00:23:07.480" style="s2">positive and great so really key thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.800" end="00:23:09.340" style="s2">in the lion Gazelle example is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.480" end="00:23:10.540" style="s2">difference in the worst case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.340" end="00:23:12.970" style="s2">right so when you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.540" end="00:23:14.770" style="s2">amygdala and threat detection the lion</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.970" end="00:23:17.560" style="s2">recognizes that the threat is it might</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.770" end="00:23:19.420" style="s2">not it might expend some energy which</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.560" end="00:23:22.420" style="s2">can be dangerous and the gazelle</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.420" end="00:23:24.220" style="s2">recognizes that it might die and so they</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.420" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">both have arousal but they have a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.220" end="00:23:29.980" style="s2">different sense of total worst-case</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:34.660" style="s2">scenario threat projection so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.980" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">curious when you looked at the you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.660" end="00:23:37.780" style="s2">the mice under these different cases or</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:39.340" style="s2">the humans under these different cases</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.780" end="00:23:40.900" style="s2">rather than looking at the differences</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.340" end="00:23:42.940" style="s2">in the xiphoid looking at the difference</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.900" end="00:23:44.440" style="s2">in the amygdala and saying of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.940" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">they&#39;re all going to be recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.440" end="00:23:48.730" style="s2">threat but do the courage scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.530" style="s2">involve some difference in the amygdala</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.730" end="00:23:52.750" style="s2">where it&#39;s actually not processing the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.530" end="00:23:54.430" style="s2">threat as being more than it has</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.750" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">capacity to respond to because it would</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.430" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">seem like Courage&#39;s I actually have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:24:00.580" style="s2">capacity to respond to this threat</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:03.070" style="s2">versus not I&#39;m so glad you asked this</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.580" end="00:24:04.690" style="s2">question because it points to a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.070" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">interesting result that we have in hand</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.690" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">and then I forgot to mention earlier</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.670" end="00:24:14.200" style="s2">this the xiphoid nucleus as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.340" end="00:24:15.970" style="s2">earlier connects to the hello which is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.200" end="00:24:18.370" style="s2">threat detection center it connects to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.970" end="00:24:21.160" style="s2">the nucleus accumbens which is stated</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.370" end="00:24:23.770" style="s2">with dopaminergic related reward and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.160" end="00:24:25.330" style="s2">projects to the four brain areas the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.770" end="00:24:26.269" style="s2">brain involved in cognitive processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.330" end="00:24:29.509" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.269" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">prefrontal cortex in particular Lindsay</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.509" end="00:24:32.989" style="s2">did a beautiful set of experiments in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:35.629" style="s2">which she could tease out which of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.989" end="00:24:37.759" style="s2">pathways when activated could actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.629" end="00:24:40.669" style="s2">trigger the animal towards a reduced</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.759" end="00:24:43.309" style="s2">fear response and increased courage by</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.669" end="00:24:46.879" style="s2">increasing the activity of the xiphoid</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.309" end="00:24:48.589" style="s2">to forebrain pathway in particular when</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.879" end="00:24:53.059" style="s2">she increased the activity of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.589" end="00:24:56.119" style="s2">xiphoid to amygdala he or she she saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.059" end="00:24:58.099" style="s2">more fear sure less courage and so what</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.119" end="00:24:59.419" style="s2">you really got now is a structure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.099" end="00:25:01.129" style="s2">sort of like an old school switch</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.419" end="00:25:02.239" style="s2">operator and the telephones what some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.129" end="00:25:03.829" style="s2">your listeners won&#39;t know what that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.239" end="00:25:05.359" style="s2">because this is like something from you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.829" end="00:25:06.919" style="s2">know even before my childhood where</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.359" end="00:25:09.139" style="s2">people take out plugs and put it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.919" end="00:25:10.519" style="s2">like a switchboard where basically the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.139" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">structure is integrating sensory</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.519" end="00:25:14.329" style="s2">information not just visual information</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.440" end="00:25:15.950" style="s2">but it&#39;s sensory input and then making</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.329" end="00:25:17.239" style="s2">decisions about okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.950" end="00:25:18.919" style="s2">under these conditions where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.239" end="00:25:21.259" style="s2">this certain amount of threat what am I</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.919" end="00:25:23.509" style="s2">gonna do what&#39;s the best outcome am i</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.259" end="00:25:25.099" style="s2">willing to take on some risk that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.509" end="00:25:27.799" style="s2">that the forebrain is making that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.099" end="00:25:29.839" style="s2">assessment and so this is what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.799" end="00:25:31.519" style="s2">really about it&#39;s not about going into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.839" end="00:25:33.529" style="s2">heightened level of arousal to the point</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.519" end="00:25:35.659" style="s2">where you lose your cognition it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.529" end="00:25:37.820" style="s2">maintaining clear cognition under</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.659" end="00:25:39.859" style="s2">heightened state of arousal so this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.820" end="00:25:41.179" style="s2">brings up so many questions because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.859" end="00:25:44.239" style="s2">forebrain of a mouse and the forebrain</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.179" end="00:25:48.139" style="s2">of a human are not really good analogs</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.239" end="00:25:50.179" style="s2">at all right because for brain of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.139" end="00:25:52.339" style="s2">human prefrontal cortex the abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.179" end="00:25:54.379" style="s2">capacity to not just look at our past</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.339" end="00:25:56.209" style="s2">experiences and see which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.379" end="00:25:58.609" style="s2">relevant in here but actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.209" end="00:26:01.669" style="s2">assess the scenario in a truly abstract</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.609" end="00:26:05.690" style="s2">way I&#39;m super curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.669" end="00:26:08.089" style="s2">difference there yeah so prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.690" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">cortex in Mouse is not nearly as evolved</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.089" end="00:26:11.929" style="s2">and when I say evolved I mean it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:13.820" style="s2">have as much stuff there even there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.929" end="00:26:15.229" style="s2">often prefrontal cortex you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.820" end="00:26:16.519" style="s2">find in a mouse you&#39;re not gonna find in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.229" end="00:26:18.950" style="s2">a monkey</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.519" end="00:26:21.409" style="s2">you know the massive expansion of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.950" end="00:26:23.239" style="s2">cerebral cortex in humans which is why</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.409" end="00:26:24.859" style="s2">has all the gyrating bumps he taken all</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.239" end="00:26:27.139" style="s2">that and crammed it into a small store</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.859" end="00:26:28.849" style="s2">as a mouse goes there mouse brain is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.139" end="00:26:33.289" style="s2">smooth because it&#39;s less surface area</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.849" end="00:26:34.820" style="s2">for skull space essentially um so</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.289" end="00:26:36.950" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff there that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.820" end="00:26:38.539" style="s2">designing in a fine in the mouse on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.950" end="00:26:40.110" style="s2">other hand the mouse is doing some</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.539" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.110" end="00:26:44.850" style="s2">in addition to just some reacting and by</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:46.740" style="s2">thinking what we mean is that it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.850" end="00:26:49.770" style="s2">know the forebrain is required for</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.740" end="00:26:51.720" style="s2">assessing multi sensory input and making</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.770" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">decisions about which motor commands to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.720" end="00:26:55.650" style="s2">create and which wondered commands to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:26:57.780" style="s2">suppress the freezer response is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.650" end="00:26:59.669" style="s2">actually a very I mean it&#39;s an eight it</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.780" end="00:27:01.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require the cortex we know that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.669" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">based on our work and work from other</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.590" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">laboratories but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:07.710" style="s2">active response even though the animal</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:09.570" style="s2">is still it&#39;s very hard to stay</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.710" end="00:27:12.929" style="s2">completely slow for any creature unless</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.570" end="00:27:15.140" style="s2">they&#39;re dead and so you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.929" end="00:27:17.460" style="s2">forebrain of the mouse is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.140" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">exerting what we call top-down control</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.460" end="00:27:21.480" style="s2">over the behavioral response it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">interesting to look at these animals</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.480" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">when they confront the fear response in</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:26.909" style="s2">this nucleus to me they tail rattle</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:28.530" style="s2">they&#39;ll pause as if they&#39;re gonna freeze</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.909" end="00:27:30.809" style="s2">and then they and then they keep going</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.530" end="00:27:32.130" style="s2">and they&#39;ll also start moving around</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.809" end="00:27:33.870" style="s2">quite a bit more so they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.130" end="00:27:36.090" style="s2">themselves very salient very visible</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.870" end="00:27:37.350" style="s2">very audible the tail Riley actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.090" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">makes noise it&#39;s the worst thing you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.350" end="00:27:40.260" style="s2">want to do if there was a predator it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:42.690" style="s2">more like beating their chests than it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.260" end="00:27:45.570" style="s2">is freezing or fleeing or anything and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.690" end="00:27:46.860" style="s2">so so when we talk about prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.570" end="00:27:48.510" style="s2">cortex in the mouse we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.860" end="00:27:50.309" style="s2">a rudimentary kind of primitive</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.510" end="00:27:53.610" style="s2">prefrontal cortex which is probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.309" end="00:27:58.740" style="s2">doing some math of contingencies if a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.610" end="00:28:00.809" style="s2">then B and if B then C you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.740" end="00:28:02.820" style="s2">brain is doing math whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.809" end="00:28:04.230" style="s2">like math or not what neurons are doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.820" end="00:28:06.990" style="s2">is they&#39;re computing things in space and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.230" end="00:28:08.490" style="s2">time and making assessments they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.990" end="00:28:10.590" style="s2">thinking there&#39;s a little person in</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.490" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">there the collective is the person or</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.590" end="00:28:15.179" style="s2">the mouse but the collective activity of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:16.770" style="s2">those neurons but clearly the forebrain</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.179" end="00:28:18.600" style="s2">is exerting some top-down control</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.770" end="00:28:21.419" style="s2">they&#39;re good experiments for instance</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.600" end="00:28:23.580" style="s2">where if you take even just an owl which</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.419" end="00:28:26.100" style="s2">is a very visual and auditory hunter as</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:28.200" style="s2">we know and you lesion the forebrain</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.100" end="00:28:30.750" style="s2">input to some of these subcortical areas</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.200" end="00:28:32.340" style="s2">that control motor reflexes they become</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.750" end="00:28:33.990" style="s2">like machines if you go like this the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.340" end="00:28:36.570" style="s2">owl will look everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.990" end="00:28:38.549" style="s2">think of a kitten or a puppy when my</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.570" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">bulldog Costello was a puppy I could put</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.549" end="00:28:40.890" style="s2">anything in front of him and he pick it</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:43.559" style="s2">up with his mouth</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.890" end="00:28:45.900" style="s2">anything I could anything was a toy now</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.559" end="00:28:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know he&#39;s older his</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.900" end="00:28:50.970" style="s2">forebrain is is developed and for a long</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.450" end="00:28:52.230" style="s2">time now he&#39;s just not as excited by</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.970" end="00:28:53.170" style="s2">these little things this is what makes</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.230" end="00:28:55.090" style="s2">puppies and kittens</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.170" end="00:28:56.890" style="s2">Judis kind of they walk with walk along</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.090" end="00:28:58.450" style="s2">they grab a quarter they roll over they</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.890" end="00:28:59.710" style="s2">pee in the corner they do they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.450" end="00:29:01.690" style="s2">of helpless in the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.710" end="00:29:04.210" style="s2">everything&#39;s with stimulus as the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.690" end="00:29:05.680" style="s2">forebrain matures and myelin aids and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.210" end="00:29:08.560" style="s2">top-down control from the forebrain</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.680" end="00:29:10.420" style="s2">matures and myelin aids animals become</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.560" end="00:29:11.770" style="s2">much more focused and dedicated in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.420" end="00:29:13.930" style="s2">actions that they&#39;ll take in that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.770" end="00:29:15.490" style="s2">won&#39;t take think a predator a lion</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.930" end="00:29:17.170" style="s2">that&#39;s waiting for the gazelle there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.490" end="00:29:18.370" style="s2">lot of active suppression it&#39;s making an</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.170" end="00:29:20.380" style="s2">assessment which ones are moving quickly</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.370" end="00:29:21.970" style="s2">which ones are moving slowly am I gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.380" end="00:29:24.310" style="s2">attack the flanks or am I can attack the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.970" end="00:29:25.870" style="s2">head these kinds of things those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.310" end="00:29:28.120" style="s2">assessments are clearly for brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.870" end="00:29:30.010" style="s2">assessments so there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.120" end="00:29:33.550" style="s2">feedback loop that&#39;s interesting here in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.010" end="00:29:37.150" style="s2">this shunting from the xiphoid to either</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.550" end="00:29:40.510" style="s2">more Minghella action or more frontal</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.150" end="00:29:44.170" style="s2">action because to say that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.510" end="00:29:47.410" style="s2">top-down control from frontal only if</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.170" end="00:29:49.000" style="s2">the xiphoid already shunted that way or</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.410" end="00:29:50.440" style="s2">there is a little bit that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.000" end="00:29:52.570" style="s2">happening so there&#39;s some feedback</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.440" end="00:29:54.430" style="s2">process between the prefrontal and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.570" end="00:29:57.480" style="s2">xiphoid that then helps inform the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.430" end="00:29:59.800" style="s2">xiphoid shunt more or not yeah have you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.480" end="00:30:02.230" style="s2">this question is where is the inte where</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.800" end="00:30:04.210" style="s2">is the actual point of intervention nice</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.230" end="00:30:07.210" style="s2">cool question you know that the fuel in</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.210" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">earth science has progressed so far we</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.210" end="00:30:11.590" style="s2">can now control the activity of real of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:14.200" style="s2">neurons in real time in the whole animal</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.590" end="00:30:16.990" style="s2">and make these kinds of assessments even</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.200" end="00:30:19.030" style="s2">in specific neuron types very few</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.990" end="00:30:20.860" style="s2">experiments including in our laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.030" end="00:30:22.300" style="s2">have assessed these kind of the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.860" end="00:30:24.070" style="s2">interplay between different structures</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.300" end="00:30:26.350" style="s2">in real time that&#39;s really represents</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.070" end="00:30:29.650" style="s2">that I think in the next five years of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.350" end="00:30:31.180" style="s2">work not not to defer but we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.650" end="00:30:32.980" style="s2">getting to the point where we can do</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.180" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">that reasonably and but I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.980" end="00:30:35.230" style="s2">right I think that it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">activity streaming through the xiphoid</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.230" end="00:30:39.070" style="s2">to all three structures and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:41.110" style="s2">overall state of the animal will</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.070" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">probably dictate the extent to which the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.110" end="00:30:45.610" style="s2">balance of activity between you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.910" end="00:30:47.620" style="s2">shifted towards frontal cortex can</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.610" end="00:30:49.690" style="s2">suppressing amygdala this kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.620" end="00:30:53.770" style="s2">battle of neural activation if you will</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.690" end="00:30:54.970" style="s2">um you know it brings up you could bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.770" end="00:30:56.860" style="s2">up an anecdote but it brings up a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.970" end="00:30:58.870" style="s2">scenario where if you&#39;ve ever been in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.860" end="00:31:01.540" style="s2">panic situation a very high-stress</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.870" end="00:31:05.260" style="s2">situation and you&#39;re not trained to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.540" end="00:31:06.520" style="s2">into an automatic motor pattern you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.260" end="00:31:06.930" style="s2">start becoming erratic with your</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.520" end="00:31:09.000" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.930" end="00:31:10.560" style="s2">the fear response takes over is you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.000" end="00:31:13.170" style="s2">I had this happen when when our dives</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.560" end="00:31:15.870" style="s2">recently had an air air failure I was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.170" end="00:31:17.460" style="s2">technical failure there&#39;s a really bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.870" end="00:31:19.860" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.460" end="00:31:23.070" style="s2">white sharks everywhere outside the cage</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.860" end="00:31:25.500" style="s2">I was in the cage at that point safety</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.070" end="00:31:29.970" style="s2">tank not available to me at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.500" end="00:31:35.010" style="s2">for reasons we could discuss really it</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.970" end="00:31:36.900" style="s2">was like the worst situation except for</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.010" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">not except for not being able to get out</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.900" end="00:31:41.820" style="s2">of the cage so the decision was you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:44.820" style="s2">you err suddenly cut out and my first</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.820" end="00:31:45.870" style="s2">thought was you got to be kidding me and</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.820" end="00:31:48.990" style="s2">this isn&#39;t happening it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.870" end="00:31:51.030" style="s2">disbelief second thought no joke was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.990" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">going home I&#39;m gonna see Costello that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.030" end="00:31:54.870" style="s2">was really the thought that went through</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.040" style="s2">my it was a cognitive decision wand I</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.870" end="00:31:58.230" style="s2">going home</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.040" end="00:32:00.630" style="s2">third go to the safety tank that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.230" end="00:32:02.310" style="s2">what I&#39;d been trained to do safety</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.630" end="00:32:04.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t open go to the second safety tank</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.310" end="00:32:06.090" style="s2">safety didn&#39;t open or his open lose</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.140" end="00:32:08.220" style="s2">empty so now it&#39;s like so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.090" end="00:32:10.610" style="s2">immediately go into these automatic you</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.220" end="00:32:13.410" style="s2">know these OODA loop kind of responses</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.610" end="00:32:14.790" style="s2">as the military refers to them and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.410" end="00:32:16.230" style="s2">it was okay I guess I&#39;m gonna drop my</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.790" end="00:32:19.500" style="s2">weight belt and shoot for the surface</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.230" end="00:32:21.960" style="s2">because I wasn&#39;t on scuba which is great</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.500" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">for getting back to air there&#39;s air at</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.960" end="00:32:27.920" style="s2">the surface so I stay down 100% serhiy</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:30.420" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna die from lack of oxygen but</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.920" end="00:32:32.190" style="s2">you&#39;re surrounded by large great whites</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.420" end="00:32:33.780" style="s2">this is not a good situation they love</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.190" end="00:32:35.070" style="s2">to eat things or go after things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.780" end="00:32:36.360" style="s2">shooting for the surface in fact the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.070" end="00:32:38.130" style="s2">that you cage exit and swim with great</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.360" end="00:32:39.750" style="s2">whites is by swimming toward them when</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.130" end="00:32:40.950" style="s2">they come out at you and alongside them</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.750" end="00:32:43.140" style="s2">you loom on them</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.950" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">and they&#39;re not used to their their apex</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.140" end="00:32:46.950" style="s2">predator so they&#39;re not usually</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.450" style="s2">comfortable with things looming on them</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.950" end="00:32:50.370" style="s2">so they treat you with respect if you do</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.450" end="00:32:52.590" style="s2">that if you act like prey they will</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.370" end="00:32:55.920" style="s2">treat you like prey but at that point it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.590" end="00:32:57.240" style="s2">was really that was my only choice I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:32:59.010" style="s2">fortunate enough that one of the out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.240" end="00:33:00.930" style="s2">cage divers turned around and saw me and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.010" end="00:33:03.210" style="s2">made the what felt like a very slow</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.930" end="00:33:04.590" style="s2">Traverse back to the cage and then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.210" end="00:33:07.230" style="s2">did the you know sort of classic share</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.590" end="00:33:08.610" style="s2">everything but even that of grabbing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.230" end="00:33:10.260" style="s2">regulator and breathing off his air and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.610" end="00:33:12.030" style="s2">then passing it back and forth is</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.260" end="00:33:14.430" style="s2">something that if you&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.030" end="00:33:15.540" style="s2">do in your dive training a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.430" end="00:33:17.550" style="s2">just hold on to it and the other guy</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.540" end="00:33:18.950" style="s2">ends up dying there&#39;s a struggle where</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.550" end="00:33:21.320" style="s2">they let go I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.950" end="00:33:22.970" style="s2">you have to be calm enough and so this</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.320" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">was a situation which I could sense my</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.970" end="00:33:26.870" style="s2">behavior starting to get a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:29.240" style="s2">erratic as each of the motor programs</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.870" end="00:33:35.000" style="s2">that I had been lined up or trained to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.240" end="00:33:36.230" style="s2">perform was giving me a an F like oh no</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.000" end="00:33:37.490" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get air here you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.230" end="00:33:39.860" style="s2">gonna get it they&#39;re here Avery starts</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.490" end="00:33:41.240" style="s2">getting a little Matic so I think what</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.860" end="00:33:42.980" style="s2">happens is there&#39;s a number of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.240" end="00:33:44.419" style="s2">happening this your state is going up</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.980" end="00:33:47.149" style="s2">carbon dioxide is increasing in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.419" end="00:33:49.850" style="s2">system and your behavior starts getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.149" end="00:33:52.100" style="s2">a little bit more crazy if you will and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.850" end="00:33:53.960" style="s2">this is why people who you know they</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.100" end="00:33:56.149" style="s2">can&#39;t even dial 911 under conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.960" end="00:33:58.850" style="s2">emergency or they get tangled up in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.149" end="00:34:00.710" style="s2">seaweed while diving some kelp and their</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.850" end="00:34:03.019" style="s2">regulator gets kicked out or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.710" end="00:34:04.850" style="s2">or their and and they they find them</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.019" end="00:34:06.529" style="s2">dead ten minutes later it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.850" end="00:34:08.690" style="s2">they didn&#39;t couldn&#39;t reach over and grab</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.529" end="00:34:10.609" style="s2">it it&#39;s because you you start to lose</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.690" end="00:34:12.050" style="s2">you lose yourself and so one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.609" end="00:34:14.389" style="s2">exciting and interesting areas of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.050" end="00:34:16.070" style="s2">neuroscience that&#39;s really evolving fast</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.389" end="00:34:17.690" style="s2">this is some beautiful work that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.070" end="00:34:19.460" style="s2">done by guy named Steven Leary Lee is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.690" end="00:34:21.530" style="s2">out at Harvard looking at vagal</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.460" end="00:34:22.429" style="s2">stimulation and other people like our</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.530" end="00:34:25.310" style="s2">lab they&#39;re looking an adrenal</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.429" end="00:34:27.349" style="s2">stimulation is finally after years of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.310" end="00:34:28.970" style="s2">this mind-body separation and people</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.349" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">even talk about mind versus body people</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.970" end="00:34:33.619" style="s2">are starting to look at how the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:35.179" style="s2">periphery you know that the vagus and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.619" end="00:34:38.629" style="s2">the adrenals and stuff that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.179" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">in the body is impacting neural</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:44.089" style="s2">it&#39;s like and you might say duh of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.379" end="00:34:46.819" style="s2">course it&#39;s all one system but when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.089" end="00:34:50.270" style="s2">and I were growing up it was mine versus</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.819" end="00:34:51.379" style="s2">body where it was brain versus mine and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.270" end="00:34:52.790" style="s2">I think it&#39;s wonderful that we&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.379" end="00:34:53.960" style="s2">discarded of that and it&#39;s like of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.790" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">course there&#39;s an organ in your head</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.960" end="00:34:59.780" style="s2">it&#39;s all working together that was a was</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:03.589" style="s2">a good test experience that you had with</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.780" end="00:35:06.650" style="s2">the Sharks I have to say I I got to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.589" end="00:35:08.810" style="s2">surface I was vomiting or confident</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.650" end="00:35:10.040" style="s2">below the water and I have to say as I</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.040" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">anybody but I am I am immensely grateful</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.119" end="00:35:18.710" style="s2">and I knew that what happened over the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:20.420" style="s2">next 24 hours was extremely important if</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.710" end="00:35:21.770" style="s2">my interpretation was very important</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.420" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">this more about the top-down control</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.770" end="00:35:27.530" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t wish for that experience but</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:29.859" style="s2">I have a good friend who joined us on</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.530" end="00:35:32.359" style="s2">the dive we insanely also cage I said</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.859" end="00:35:35.480" style="s2">good friend Pat Dawson he came</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.359" end="00:35:37.700" style="s2">to me afterwards and he said immediately</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.480" end="00:35:41.089" style="s2">the first question he asked me has some</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.700" end="00:35:44.749" style="s2">experience when to high stress scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.089" end="00:35:46.099" style="s2">and he pulled me aside and said so what</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.749" end="00:35:47.869" style="s2">you take away from that experience that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.099" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">was the first question that I was asked</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.869" end="00:35:53.150" style="s2">not are you okay or in that immediately</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:55.489" style="s2">was like okay what do I take away I took</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.150" end="00:35:58.579" style="s2">away check the safeties yourself don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.489" end="00:36:00.559" style="s2">rely on it turned out it was a human</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.579" end="00:36:04.849" style="s2">communication error really that led to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.559" end="00:36:06.140" style="s2">that situation and I also felt tested I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.849" end="00:36:07.910" style="s2">feel I&#39;m actually grateful for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.140" end="00:36:09.410" style="s2">experience in retrospect because I felt</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.910" end="00:36:12.319" style="s2">tested it felt like a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.410" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">rebirth of sorts and it was actually the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.319" end="00:36:16.039" style="s2">next day that I cage accident for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:17.210" style="s2">first time and people say even on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.039" end="00:36:19.640" style="s2">bow they&#39;re like they really gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.210" end="00:36:21.410" style="s2">that but look I&#39;m a scientist the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.640" end="00:36:22.759" style="s2">probabilities are independent the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.410" end="00:36:24.920" style="s2">probability that it would happen the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.759" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">next day is totally independent I say I</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.920" end="00:36:28.430" style="s2">was on scuba so they&#39;re independent</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:29.809" style="s2">probabilities right flipping a coin once</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.430" end="00:36:31.579" style="s2">flipping it twice independent</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.809" end="00:36:33.140" style="s2">probabilities and the second thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.579" end="00:36:34.609" style="s2">knew what had happened and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.140" end="00:36:36.349" style="s2">when you have the benefit of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.609" end="00:36:39.650" style="s2">what went wrong you&#39;re in a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.349" end="00:36:42.380" style="s2">position to to make different choices so</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.650" end="00:36:43.670" style="s2">this when you say I&#39;m a scientist you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.380" end="00:36:46.999" style="s2">actually saying something very important</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.670" end="00:36:48.980" style="s2">you&#39;re saying I have frontal override of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.999" end="00:36:50.599" style="s2">the rest of the response because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.980" end="00:36:52.130" style="s2">actually have a rational process that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.599" end="00:36:53.690" style="s2">the probabilities are independent that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.130" end="00:36:55.369" style="s2">the things that made it scary yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.690" end="00:36:57.769" style="s2">aren&#39;t gonna make it scary today because</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.369" end="00:37:00.829" style="s2">I&#39;ve adjusted it therefore I can control</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.769" end="00:37:04.430" style="s2">my fear response that&#39;s right and and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.829" end="00:37:06.619" style="s2">have to say that much of my life and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.430" end="00:37:10.700" style="s2">perhaps is why I eventually decided to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.619" end="00:37:12.980" style="s2">study fear much much of my life has</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.700" end="00:37:14.779" style="s2">centered around putting myself into</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.980" end="00:37:17.480" style="s2">scenarios that for me were felt</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.779" end="00:37:19.730" style="s2">threatening and you know I always tried</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.480" end="00:37:23.239" style="s2">to assume a reasonable sense of risk</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.730" end="00:37:25.489" style="s2">reward trade-off you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.239" end="00:37:28.609" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be haphazard or crazy</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.489" end="00:37:31.849" style="s2">I mean I look at Honnold right who climb</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.609" end="00:37:33.739" style="s2">El Cap no ropes no nothing I mean but he</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.849" end="00:37:35.210" style="s2">he didn&#39;t just do it what you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.739" end="00:37:36.410" style="s2">first time with no ropes I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.210" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">rehearsed it to the point where his</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.410" end="00:37:40.609" style="s2">confidence he was doing you know he knew</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:42.140" style="s2">all the holes I mean I think I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.609" end="00:37:43.489" style="s2">climber but I&#39;ve spoken to some climbers</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.140" end="00:37:45.540" style="s2">and what they said that&#39;s so incredible</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.489" end="00:37:47.220" style="s2">about the fact that he did that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.540" end="00:37:48.570" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t just his fear suppression it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.220" end="00:37:49.980" style="s2">was the fact that he remembered all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.570" end="00:37:51.270" style="s2">sequences that are required under</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.980" end="00:37:52.260" style="s2">different conditions because it can be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.270" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">different depending on weather</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.260" end="00:37:57.300" style="s2">conditions and rock conditions etc and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:37:59.220" style="s2">those interact so I think that being</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.300" end="00:38:02.460" style="s2">able to really reasonably assess risk</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.220" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">under high stress is important being</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.460" end="00:38:07.230" style="s2">adaptive is one of the things I pride</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:09.030" style="s2">myself on yeah and of course I was out</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.230" end="00:38:10.500" style="s2">there with experts and we had permits</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.030" end="00:38:11.580" style="s2">from the Mexican government to do the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.500" end="00:38:12.930" style="s2">cage acts that you&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.580" end="00:38:13.890" style="s2">allowed to do it without permits and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.930" end="00:38:15.360" style="s2">this kind of thing you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.890" end="00:38:20.760" style="s2">lot of recklessness that goes on out</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.360" end="00:38:23.400" style="s2">there that I don&#39;t support and at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.760" end="00:38:25.260" style="s2">same time I that&#39;s right I think my</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.400" end="00:38:27.600" style="s2">cognitive override process is a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.260" end="00:38:28.920" style="s2">extreme I guess in the world of you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.600" end="00:38:30.750" style="s2">you get sometimes go to the gym and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.920" end="00:38:31.860" style="s2">see those guys who have huge upper</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.750" end="00:38:34.350" style="s2">bodies but no legs</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.860" end="00:38:36.330" style="s2">I have strive to not be the guy who just</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.350" end="00:38:39.510" style="s2">thinks and doesn&#39;t feel you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.330" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">want to be the knurl parallel for that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.510" end="00:38:44.850" style="s2">but no but there&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">important here you weren&#39;t saying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.850" end="00:38:49.190" style="s2">you were gonna override fear for</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">irrational reasons you were actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.190" end="00:38:56.310" style="s2">making sure that you didn&#39;t miss</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:58.290" style="s2">associate what the source of warranted</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.310" end="00:39:00.420" style="s2">fear was right you&#39;re doing realistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.290" end="00:39:03.420" style="s2">assessment and most of the time what</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.420" end="00:39:05.280" style="s2">happens is right it&#39;s our our adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.420" end="00:39:07.710" style="s2">response fear obviously is it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.280" end="00:39:09.240" style="s2">evolutionarily very useful to keep us to</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.710" end="00:39:12.180" style="s2">have us avoid things it could be harmful</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.240" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">right and whenever we have pain then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.180" end="00:39:16.410" style="s2">have fear around having that same source</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">of pain in the future to protect us from</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.410" end="00:39:20.220" style="s2">something that could be harmful but we</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:23.220" style="s2">usually actually get the causation wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.220" end="00:39:25.950" style="s2">so we go up for public speaking and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.220" end="00:39:27.420" style="s2">have a painful experience and so then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.950" end="00:39:28.680" style="s2">say well I&#39;m never gonna public speak</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.420" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">again because public speaking was the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.680" end="00:39:33.570" style="s2">cause of pain as opposed to identifying</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:34.920" style="s2">more carefully being concerned what</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.570" end="00:39:37.350" style="s2">everyone thought of me and thinking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.920" end="00:39:39.210" style="s2">not good enough was the source of pain</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.350" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">and I can actually change that and still</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.210" end="00:39:43.050" style="s2">be able to public speak so one shrinks</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:45.090" style="s2">your world unnecessarily the other one</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.050" end="00:39:47.010" style="s2">gives you the capacity to say is there</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.090" end="00:39:49.290" style="s2">something that I can actually do in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.010" end="00:39:50.790" style="s2">presence of the stimulating yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.290" end="00:39:53.010" style="s2">really really excellent point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.790" end="00:39:55.620" style="s2">making I mean I feel like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.010" end="00:39:57.400" style="s2">fundamental things and I&#39;ve spent the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.620" end="00:39:59.080" style="s2">last couple years because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.400" end="00:40:00.730" style="s2">considering writing a book on</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.080" end="00:40:02.350" style="s2">neuroscience for the general public that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.730" end="00:40:03.880" style="s2">brings in some of the more modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.350" end="00:40:05.710" style="s2">understanding about how neural circuits</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.880" end="00:40:07.510" style="s2">work there&#39;s some great stuff out there</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.710" end="00:40:09.670" style="s2">but I think that we&#39;re getting a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.510" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">lost still in this idea of like lizard</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.670" end="00:40:12.670" style="s2">brain versus thinking brain I mean these</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">things work as a dynamic interplay</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.670" end="00:40:17.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not working independently and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:18.730" style="s2">and I enjoy talking about neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.110" end="00:40:22.090" style="s2">the general Republican and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.730" end="00:40:24.460" style="s2">things that really you know I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.180" end="00:41:11.380" style="s2">that they&#39;d be thankful I mean I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.670" end="00:41:13.450" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna that doesn&#39;t change how</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.380" end="00:41:15.550" style="s2">dangerous a shark is Brandon are</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.450" end="00:41:17.740" style="s2">independent and so I think for trauma</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.550" end="00:41:20.650" style="s2">you know so much of it is a even if</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.740" end="00:41:21.730" style="s2">people can cognitively say yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.650" end="00:41:23.860" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t my fault</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.730" end="00:41:25.510" style="s2">I know I know I had every right to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.860" end="00:41:27.220" style="s2">walking home at night at that time</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.510" end="00:41:29.650" style="s2">people report this kind of thing right</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.220" end="00:41:31.990" style="s2">or I know that you know I really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.650" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">do anything wrong they feel as if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.990" end="00:41:34.780" style="s2">did something wrong because they were</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:37.030" style="s2">involved and so the brain is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.780" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">linked to contingencies and said I must</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.030" end="00:41:42.430" style="s2">be it somehow involved in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:46.630" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have been and I think that so</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.430" end="00:41:49.930" style="s2">that that failure of who&#39;s to blame at</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.630" end="00:41:53.460" style="s2">an emotional level is really underlies a</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.930" end="00:41:55.600" style="s2">lot of what people report as trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.460" end="00:41:57.220" style="s2">otherwise it would just be look I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.600" end="00:41:58.840" style="s2">wronged and so now I&#39;m gonna take myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.220" end="00:42:00.700" style="s2">out of the scenario in which I was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.840" end="00:42:02.710" style="s2">and I&#39;m safe but the brain doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.700" end="00:42:04.150" style="s2">that and so we were confused I think we</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.710" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">think that post-traumatic stress is all</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.150" end="00:42:07.780" style="s2">just a replay of some circuit because</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.940" style="s2">the experience was so intense look</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.780" end="00:42:14.349" style="s2">people have been experiencing in 10</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.940" end="00:42:16.119" style="s2">intensely scary and traumatic scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.349" end="00:42:17.980" style="s2">since the beginning of time and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.119" end="00:42:20.619" style="s2">been able to dump those and keep going</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.980" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">in a bleep reasonably happy lives and</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.619" end="00:42:23.770" style="s2">there&#39;s things like social support and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:25.300" style="s2">of course sometimes these mechanisms go</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.770" end="00:42:27.579" style="s2">off and people need real reals</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.300" end="00:42:30.369" style="s2">you know other forms of support medical</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.579" end="00:42:33.849" style="s2">interventions and so forth but really</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.369" end="00:42:37.569" style="s2">it&#39;s a failure to to dump the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.849" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">or you know that somehow oneself was to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.569" end="00:42:42.190" style="s2">blame and I think that that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:43.420" style="s2">just by virtue of being there and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.190" end="00:42:45.190" style="s2">think that that&#39;s something that in</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.420" end="00:42:47.050" style="s2">animals you see there&#39;s like a condition</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.190" end="00:42:48.910" style="s2">placed preference or condition place</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.050" end="00:42:50.650" style="s2">avoidance if you give a mouse something</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.910" end="00:42:52.569" style="s2">it likes in a location it goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.650" end="00:42:54.970" style="s2">that location how my dog Costello does</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.569" end="00:42:57.339" style="s2">that hell I do that but if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.970" end="00:42:58.810" style="s2">experience something bad in a given</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.339" end="00:43:00.130" style="s2">environment the tendency is to not go</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.810" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">back into that environment you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.130" end="00:43:06.040" style="s2">nature likes to cut a broad marking so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:07.780" style="s2">think this conversation brings up both</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.040" end="00:43:09.369" style="s2">why cognitive behavioral therapy is</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.780" end="00:43:11.380" style="s2">effective and the limits of its</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.369" end="00:43:12.760" style="s2">effectiveness at the same time and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.380" end="00:43:14.710" style="s2">when because there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.760" end="00:43:16.089" style="s2">mechanisms happening right so we think</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.710" end="00:43:17.829" style="s2">about cognitive behavioral therapy we</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.089" end="00:43:19.480" style="s2">think about exactly what you did when</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.829" end="00:43:21.130" style="s2">you said they&#39;re independent</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.480" end="00:43:23.140" style="s2">probabilities one day on the next and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.130" end="00:43:26.680" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna check the tanks myself and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.140" end="00:43:30.010" style="s2">scuba hat means that you know I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.680" end="00:43:32.410" style="s2">the shark risk non oxygen risk that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.010" end="00:43:35.020" style="s2">a straight like CBT kind of action that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.410" end="00:43:36.579" style="s2">said hey let&#39;s not make a fear that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.020" end="00:43:39.369" style="s2">not actually a warranted appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.579" end="00:43:41.230" style="s2">fear and in cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.369" end="00:43:43.599" style="s2">we look at things like getting the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.230" end="00:43:46.300" style="s2">causation wrong so over generalizing as</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.599" end="00:43:49.060" style="s2">a classic one we were kids we trusted</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.300" end="00:43:51.460" style="s2">our parents they hurt us and so we</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.060" end="00:43:53.050" style="s2">imprinted everyone who you trust is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.460" end="00:43:55.930" style="s2">gonna hurt you don&#39;t trust anybody and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.050" end="00:43:57.970" style="s2">of course that represented like N equals</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.930" end="00:43:59.770" style="s2">two out of all people and when we were a</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.970" end="00:44:02.500" style="s2">kid and didn&#39;t know how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.770" end="00:44:04.270" style="s2">assess for trustworthiness and defend</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.500" end="00:44:05.980" style="s2">ourselves and speak up and etc so then</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.270" end="00:44:07.450" style="s2">we grow up and we say whoa I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.980" end="00:44:10.180" style="s2">avoiding trust my whole life because of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.450" end="00:44:11.829" style="s2">this over generalization maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.180" end="00:44:13.780" style="s2">true that all people we trust are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.829" end="00:44:16.210" style="s2">hurt us maybe it&#39;s I didn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.780" end="00:44:18.609" style="s2">assess trustworthiness yet and now I can</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.210" end="00:44:21.190" style="s2">so there&#39;s some increased capacity so</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.609" end="00:44:22.839" style="s2">the CBT part is get the causation right</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.190" end="00:44:23.920" style="s2">right so that you aren&#39;t over</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.839" end="00:44:26.200" style="s2">generalizing</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.920" end="00:44:28.360" style="s2">and the fear response is if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.200" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">clear let&#39;s make a very wide just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.360" end="00:44:31.030" style="s2">go anywhere in that area if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:32.770" style="s2">know where the landmine is just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.030" end="00:44:33.610" style="s2">even go to that field right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.770" end="00:44:35.380" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.610" end="00:44:38.080" style="s2">my sister is deathly afraid of sharks</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.380" end="00:44:39.310" style="s2">you know she she&#39;s not scientist she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.080" end="00:44:41.080" style="s2">it happens to be a therapist but she</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.310" end="00:44:42.370" style="s2">said look the probability of getting by</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.370" end="00:44:47.260" style="s2">the ocean she&#39;s not somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.550" end="00:44:49.420" style="s2">typically quantitatively oriented but</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.260" end="00:44:51.010" style="s2">she nailed it I think that the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.420" end="00:44:56.110" style="s2">is that if you want to overcome a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.010" end="00:44:57.700" style="s2">certain feeling or even hardwiring it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.110" end="00:44:59.710" style="s2">hard to know what scenarios to place</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.700" end="00:45:01.630" style="s2">yourself in to do that and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.710" end="00:45:03.880" style="s2">of the really exciting tools is going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.630" end="00:45:06.250" style="s2">be are going to be the tools that are</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.250" end="00:45:10.810" style="s2">that I don&#39;t we can get into occurring</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.840" end="00:45:13.210" style="s2">this podcast I mean I think that you</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.810" end="00:45:26.140" style="s2">at any point one thing that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.090" end="00:45:27.790" style="s2">really important for people to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.140" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">understand and thinking about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.790" end="00:45:32.440" style="s2">and just their lives is the role of</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.250" end="00:47:00.540" style="s2">particular location and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.650" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">kinda like your purpose your destination</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.540" end="00:47:03.000" style="s2">this could be in the work domain it</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:04.440" style="s2">could be in the relationship domain it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.000" end="00:47:04.860" style="s2">could be in any domain really you decide</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.440" end="00:47:07.290" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.860" end="00:47:09.510" style="s2">like for me I knew I had a kind of rough</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.290" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">teenage years for reasons related my</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.510" end="00:47:12.390" style="s2">family structure even though I had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:15.300" style="s2">good family growing up and I decided at</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.390" end="00:47:16.950" style="s2">some point at 19 that&#39;s it I&#39;m gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.300" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">serious about school and academics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.950" end="00:47:21.570" style="s2">gonna turn myself into a professional of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:23.430" style="s2">something that was positive for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.570" end="00:47:25.080" style="s2">world and I&#39;m gonna have my PhD at time</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.430" end="00:47:27.060" style="s2">I&#39;m 30 I&#39;m gonna be a faculty member but</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.080" end="00:47:29.370" style="s2">time I&#39;m 35 tenure but time for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.060" end="00:47:31.230" style="s2">those were decisions I made like a ship</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.370" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">would pick destinations and there were</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.230" end="00:47:33.930" style="s2">plenty of days in which things were</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">challenging and so what you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.930" end="00:47:38.670" style="s2">in trying to navigate any course is when</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">emotions come up they&#39;re like weather</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.670" end="00:47:42.810" style="s2">sometimes you tack down you know use</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:45.030" style="s2">kind of nautical terms you you you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.810" end="00:47:46.530" style="s2">you tack down the ship you know you wait</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.030" end="00:47:47.550" style="s2">wait out the weather sometimes if I take</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.530" end="00:47:49.650" style="s2">a different course but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.550" end="00:47:51.360" style="s2">suddenly say oh you know I&#39;m gonna steer</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.650" end="00:47:53.460" style="s2">for a completely different Coast because</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.360" end="00:47:54.840" style="s2">the waves are choppy or it&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.460" end="00:47:57.300" style="s2">really nice over there let&#39;s just go</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.840" end="00:47:59.340" style="s2">over there instead and so emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.300" end="00:48:00.810" style="s2">like weather and so you want to take</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.340" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">advantage of them when they&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.810" end="00:48:04.260" style="s2">you toward your destination but you also</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:05.910" style="s2">want to think rationally about them when</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.260" end="00:48:07.410" style="s2">they&#39;re not and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.910" end="00:48:10.470" style="s2">something that&#39;s very powerful in</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.410" end="00:48:13.110" style="s2">navigating any kind of series of nodes</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.470" end="00:48:14.850" style="s2">of decision in trying to complete a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.110" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">process whatever short or long term</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.850" end="00:48:18.990" style="s2">process that is so this this connect</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:22.170" style="s2">well to something I was gonna say about</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.990" end="00:48:25.770" style="s2">your experience in with the Sharks issue</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.170" end="00:48:28.350" style="s2">you said you felt tested and stress</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.770" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">testing is actually a really meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.350" end="00:48:33.810" style="s2">thing to assess you know how a person is</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.160" style="s2">going to respond and feature stress</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.810" end="00:48:35.970" style="s2">scenarios to know how much you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.160" end="00:48:39.380" style="s2">actually trust them</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.970" end="00:48:42.390" style="s2">under stress scenarios right and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.380" end="00:48:42.900" style="s2">specifically here when emotions get</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.390" end="00:48:45.390" style="s2">intense</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.900" end="00:48:47.820" style="s2">how much can someone continue to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.390" end="00:48:49.570" style="s2">choices based on their values as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.820" end="00:48:52.180" style="s2">to get hijacked by the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.570" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the like deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.180" end="00:48:56.980" style="s2">questions is someone&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:58.930" style="s2">maintain some some forebrain awareness</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.980" end="00:49:00.550" style="s2">in the presence of the emotion so that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.930" end="00:49:03.490" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t completely run them right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.550" end="00:49:05.980" style="s2">in which case they really lost abstract</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.490" end="00:49:07.600" style="s2">clear thinking they lost their value</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.980" end="00:49:10.180" style="s2">system as a basis for decision making</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.600" end="00:49:13.360" style="s2">and so you know one of the ways I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.180" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">about it is you&#39;ve got an emotional bell</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.360" end="00:49:18.300" style="s2">curve that of states where most the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:20.500" style="s2">people are here and right after</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.300" end="00:49:22.780" style="s2">Vipassana or psychedelics they might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.500" end="00:49:25.300" style="s2">like super elated and after trauma they</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.780" end="00:49:27.640" style="s2">might be super upset but the states can</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.300" end="00:49:29.800" style="s2">change instantly right you can hear some</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.640" end="00:49:31.960" style="s2">news and they change and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.800" end="00:49:33.580" style="s2">stage of where someone&#39;s at emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.960" end="00:49:35.740" style="s2">in their life overall is something like</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.580" end="00:49:38.020" style="s2">the center of the gravity of that bell</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.740" end="00:49:39.580" style="s2">curve but then we also have a separate</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.020" end="00:49:42.460" style="s2">bell curve of their behavior which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.580" end="00:49:43.720" style="s2">the shittiest they ever behave and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.460" end="00:49:45.700" style="s2">best they ever behave and where they</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.720" end="00:49:47.710" style="s2">generally behave in terms of how aligned</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.700" end="00:49:49.570" style="s2">with their goals how consider it etc and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.710" end="00:49:51.130" style="s2">one of the things I look at for</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.570" end="00:49:53.890" style="s2">trustworthiness is how much someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.130" end="00:49:56.080" style="s2">separates those two bell curves hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.890" end="00:49:57.850" style="s2">that their behavioral bell curve does</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.080" end="00:49:59.110" style="s2">not respond to the emotional bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.850" end="00:50:00.700" style="s2">meaning that they can get emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.110" end="00:50:03.250" style="s2">triggered into a poor state and still</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.700" end="00:50:05.400" style="s2">make good choices you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.250" end="00:50:07.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a really useful model I think as</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.400" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">there&#39;s so many of our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.600" end="00:50:12.280" style="s2">Daniel yet you put things into it I</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:15.640" style="s2">think that that&#39;s an extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.280" end="00:50:16.900" style="s2">model for people to understand I need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.640" end="00:50:19.930" style="s2">think about that a little bit more also</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.900" end="00:50:21.220" style="s2">because I think right I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.930" end="00:50:23.170" style="s2">when I select people to work in my</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.220" end="00:50:24.870" style="s2">laboratory I&#39;m looking for a passion for</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.170" end="00:50:28.270" style="s2">science because I know what&#39;s required</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.870" end="00:50:30.190" style="s2">science is hard and it&#39;s also beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.270" end="00:50:33.250" style="s2">and you get these incredible experiences</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.190" end="00:50:35.260" style="s2">and I really believe that people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.250" end="00:50:37.060" style="s2">gonna continued what will come to lab</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.260" end="00:50:39.010" style="s2">and make fundamental discoveries if they</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.060" end="00:50:43.390" style="s2">show up and work hard and and are</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.010" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">observant I also you know if I could and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.390" end="00:50:47.290" style="s2">of course I can&#39;t but if I could I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">also want a developmental history on</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.290" end="00:50:50.530" style="s2">them and I&#39;d want to know how they</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:52.420" style="s2">reacted to stressful scenarios and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.530" end="00:50:54.760" style="s2">previously which is I think it captures</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.420" end="00:50:57.460" style="s2">a little bit of your model of the bell</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.760" end="00:51:00.220" style="s2">curves of sort of emotionality versus</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.460" end="00:51:03.340" style="s2">decision-making I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna let you in</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.220" end="00:51:06.250" style="s2">on a secret here if I&#39;m hiring some</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.340" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">for a role where the trustworthiness</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.250" end="00:51:09.940" style="s2">matters a lot right deep defect out of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">trustworthiness could be really</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.940" end="00:51:13.660" style="s2">consequential and everyone should pay</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:16.260" style="s2">attention to that this should also be</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.660" end="00:51:18.850" style="s2">something that USS for when dating</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.260" end="00:51:19.960" style="s2">because trustworthiness matters a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.850" end="00:51:22.120" style="s2">and you want to assess it and of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.960" end="00:51:23.590" style="s2">early on everyone just presents their</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.120" end="00:51:26.020" style="s2">most trustworthy self and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.590" end="00:51:28.390" style="s2">mean anything at all about who they</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.020" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">actually are so I want to stress test it</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.390" end="00:51:32.830" style="s2">before actually going into a place where</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:38.320" style="s2">there&#39;s any attachment or actual risk</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.830" end="00:51:39.970" style="s2">and so what that look like is I want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.320" end="00:51:42.550" style="s2">go to a place where our logistics get</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.970" end="00:51:44.560" style="s2"> up they miss their airplane the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.550" end="00:51:46.750" style="s2">you know Eber comes late some waitress</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.560" end="00:51:48.790" style="s2">spill something on them and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.750" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">see do they yell at the waitress you</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.790" end="00:51:54.100" style="s2">know do they behave do they lose their</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:55.780" style="s2">ethical standard and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.100" end="00:51:57.730" style="s2">really the way I think about is what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.780" end="00:51:58.870" style="s2">the floor that someone sets on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.730" end="00:51:59.890" style="s2">lowest behavior they&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.870" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">accept of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.890" end="00:52:05.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like someone someone can say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:07.270" style="s2">just never going to hit my spouse when</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.800" end="00:52:07.900" style="s2">I&#39;m upset no matter how upset like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.270" end="00:52:09.400" style="s2">won&#39;t allow it</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.900" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">and they can raise it higher and say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.400" end="00:52:12.670" style="s2">not going to yell they can raise it</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:15.610" style="s2">higher and but you have to stress test</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.670" end="00:52:17.740" style="s2">it and see right yeah it&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.610" end="00:52:20.430" style="s2">mean I think that um you know so much of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.740" end="00:52:23.830" style="s2">our society and so much of life is about</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.430" end="00:52:25.720" style="s2">these boundaries for ourselves and for</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.830" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">each other you know for instance I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.720" end="00:52:30.040" style="s2">somebody that can be highly motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:31.510" style="s2">excitement and love and enthusiasm and a</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.040" end="00:52:33.550" style="s2">whole set of songs that I listen to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.510" end="00:52:37.120" style="s2">immediately just take me to a place</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.550" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">where I feel unstoppable and I have also</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.120" end="00:52:44.980" style="s2">somebody who can work pretty damn hard</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:46.540" style="s2">and um through from the place of you</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.980" end="00:52:50.020" style="s2">know you&#39;re not gonna break me kind of-</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.540" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">a little more negative or gritty kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.020" end="00:52:55.810" style="s2">mindset i can switch back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:58.150" style="s2">right I think one is more stressful than</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.810" end="00:53:01.690" style="s2">the other perhaps but both work and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.150" end="00:53:03.670" style="s2">album are what I care about but I know</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.690" end="00:53:06.070" style="s2">for myself I have boundaries I won&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.670" end="00:53:07.900" style="s2">anything unethical you know whole I</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.070" end="00:53:10.690" style="s2">cheat or steal in order to get where I</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.900" end="00:53:12.510" style="s2">need to go and what you&#39;re really trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.690" end="00:53:15.610" style="s2">to assess to you know to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.510" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">people have clear boundaries you call</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.610" end="00:53:19.300" style="s2">them values</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">really to what extent people are willing</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.300" end="00:53:26.890" style="s2">to break protocol with themselves break</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:28.540" style="s2">protocol with the group in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.890" end="00:53:30.970" style="s2">achieve what they want to achieve and um</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.540" end="00:53:32.980" style="s2">you know one thing I a good friend of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.970" end="00:53:34.270" style="s2">mine he said you know you love rules and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.980" end="00:53:36.070" style="s2">ruin and you know it&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.270" end="00:53:37.869" style="s2">love rules for a pretty I was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.070" end="00:53:39.730" style="s2">wild teenager but not because I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.869" end="00:53:44.560" style="s2">seeking fun I just I was seeking</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.730" end="00:53:47.560" style="s2">structure and um you know I I do I like</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.560" end="00:53:48.730" style="s2">rules I feel like it&#39;s been said before</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.560" end="00:53:49.750" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing profound about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.730" end="00:53:50.920" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s like a playground with</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.750" end="00:53:53.170" style="s2">a bunch of kids kicking them all around</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.920" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s next to a road and so they</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.170" end="00:53:56.260" style="s2">can&#39;t really play that freely but then</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:57.640" style="s2">you put up a chain-link fence and now</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.260" end="00:53:59.320" style="s2">you can really boot the ball as hard as</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.640" end="00:54:01.089" style="s2">you want you can run as fast as you want</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.320" end="00:54:02.859" style="s2">because there&#39;s a boundary there that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.089" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">you know that you&#39;re safe right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.859" end="00:54:07.540" style="s2">really all comes down to safety and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:11.250" style="s2">tough scenarios I&#39;ve had to navigate in</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.540" end="00:54:13.960" style="s2">managing people have generally um been</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.250" end="00:54:16.200" style="s2">you know have improved when I understood</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.960" end="00:54:19.300" style="s2">kind of what they were really afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.200" end="00:54:22.030" style="s2">afraid of failure or some cases afraid</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.300" end="00:54:23.140" style="s2">of success or afraid of having to you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.030" end="00:54:24.430" style="s2">know what was gonna happen to them or</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.140" end="00:54:26.170" style="s2">there was a backdrop of their life that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.430" end="00:54:28.089" style="s2">was more complicated I&#39;m not therapists</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.170" end="00:54:30.369" style="s2">I run a laboratory so you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.089" end="00:54:32.410" style="s2">limits to what we discuss but you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.369" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">over and over again I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.410" end="00:54:35.290" style="s2">find is to come you know Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:37.510" style="s2">hierarchy needs you know what people</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.290" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">feel safe when they feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.510" end="00:54:41.020" style="s2">some range on what they can emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:42.730" style="s2">express themselves when they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.020" end="00:54:44.530" style="s2">the group really supports them and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.730" end="00:54:46.780" style="s2">they&#39;re in the company of people that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.530" end="00:54:48.220" style="s2">have common goals I think people are</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.780" end="00:54:52.450" style="s2">willing to start tolerating more and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.220" end="00:54:53.859" style="s2">more risk and in a healthy way in order</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.450" end="00:54:55.450" style="s2">to achieve goals and so now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.859" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">talking a little bit more abstractly but</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.450" end="00:55:00.460" style="s2">I think having a system for oneself is</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:02.230" style="s2">very important and I think that public</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.460" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">declarations are very important even</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.230" end="00:55:06.990" style="s2">just think about the public declaration</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:10.180" style="s2">of merit often a public declaration</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.990" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">they&#39;re really saying look even though I</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.180" end="00:55:13.690" style="s2">might and if you just look at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">traditional vows of American marriage</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.690" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">most of those are saying even if I want</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:22.060" style="s2">to do blank I&#39;m not going to now they</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:24.250" style="s2">never say I&#39;m not going to want to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.060" end="00:55:25.930" style="s2">says even if I want to I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.250" end="00:55:27.579" style="s2">and nowadays people set different rules</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.930" end="00:55:29.480" style="s2">for their marriages than people did 50</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.579" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">years ago of course there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.480" end="00:55:34.020" style="s2">discretion and decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:37.560" style="s2">personalized decision-making there but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.020" end="00:55:39.900" style="s2">find it extremely interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.560" end="00:55:42.380" style="s2">know we we acknowledge in a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.900" end="00:55:45.120" style="s2">kind of basic ceremonies of culture that</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.380" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">what we want and what we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.120" end="00:55:50.060" style="s2">do are two different things and we make</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:51.840" style="s2">those declarations publicly so that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.060" end="00:55:54.540" style="s2">culture keeps us in line</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.840" end="00:55:57.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t want shame we want image shame</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.540" end="00:55:59.460" style="s2">ourselves you know the one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.600" end="00:56:01.530" style="s2">things about being a scientist and is</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.460" end="00:56:04.530" style="s2">that it really is a pursuit of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.530" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">and truth and so I&#39;m very lucky to be in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.530" end="00:56:07.160" style="s2">a profession where sure there are some</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:09.600" style="s2">egos and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.160" end="00:56:11.430" style="s2">definitely when I love to win feels</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.600" end="00:56:13.110" style="s2">great to get papers accepted and grants</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.430" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">funding that kind but fundamentally I</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.110" end="00:56:17.730" style="s2">want to understand how things work and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:20.760" style="s2">so my powers of self-delusion are not</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.730" end="00:56:22.710" style="s2">very strong unfortunately and so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.760" end="00:56:25.740" style="s2">know we&#39;ve just got to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.710" end="00:56:27.420" style="s2">sort of you know sweat blood in order to</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.740" end="00:56:30.870" style="s2">figure out how how this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.420" end="00:56:32.280" style="s2">structure in our heads works and and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.870" end="00:56:35.940" style="s2">everyone that comes to my lab is</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.280" end="00:56:40.070" style="s2">genuinely devoted to that okay so we had</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.940" end="00:56:40.070" style="s2">to take a short tech break there and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.850" end="00:56:45.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that we actually wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.170" end="00:56:49.230" style="s2">cover and I I think if you&#39;re open to it</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.360" end="00:56:52.230" style="s2">we&#39;ll do a part two because framing up</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.230" end="00:56:53.610" style="s2">fear you know was then a basis to say</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.230" end="00:56:55.230" style="s2">well how do we really work with us and</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.610" end="00:56:56.850" style="s2">how do we work with increasing</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.230" end="00:56:59.970" style="s2">plasticity which is where a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.850" end="00:57:03.210" style="s2">of your you know work is and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.970" end="00:57:04.920" style="s2">use breath how do we use cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.210" end="00:57:07.320" style="s2">framing how do we use vision how do we</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.920" end="00:57:09.420" style="s2">use all kinds of things to to help shift</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.320" end="00:57:11.130" style="s2">it so we&#39;ll do another part on that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.420" end="00:57:13.350" style="s2">actually pretty excited to hear about</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.130" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">the app you guys are developing as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.350" end="00:57:19.050" style="s2">and some thoughts on the future of VR</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:22.740" style="s2">psychotherapy and fear inoculation and</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.050" end="00:57:24.000" style="s2">all that fun stuff but it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.740" end="00:57:27.510" style="s2">because we&#39;re talking about fear here</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.000" end="00:57:30.030" style="s2">and you know in in general you talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.510" end="00:57:32.570" style="s2">about having a orientation towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.030" end="00:57:36.060" style="s2">increasing people&#39;s positive sense of</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.570" end="00:57:40.530" style="s2">life and emotion and motivation so talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.060" end="00:57:42.420" style="s2">about why is it actually important that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.530" end="00:57:43.020" style="s2">one understands fear if they want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.420" end="00:57:46.260" style="s2">have a life</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.020" end="00:57:49.860" style="s2">is positive and has increased capacity</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.260" end="00:57:53.700" style="s2">and motivation why is it not just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.860" end="00:57:57.000" style="s2">negative topic yeah I mean I think nice</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.700" end="00:57:59.330" style="s2">to like we wait you&#39;re in discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.000" end="00:58:01.740" style="s2">entirely but that&#39;s there gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.330" end="00:58:03.630" style="s2">obviously stressors are gonna show up</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.740" end="00:58:05.130" style="s2">and some of those are gonna be your new</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.630" end="00:58:07.350" style="s2">stressors whether or not it&#39;s a medical</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.130" end="00:58:09.510" style="s2">diagnosis that&#39;s scary or waiting for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.350" end="00:58:12.110" style="s2">metal medical diagnosis or something</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.510" end="00:58:15.330" style="s2">really acute like a you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.110" end="00:58:15.930" style="s2">robbery or break-in or something of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.330" end="00:58:17.670" style="s2">sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.930" end="00:58:20.460" style="s2">where you have to really react or not</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.670" end="00:58:23.580" style="s2">react and under pressure I think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.460" end="00:58:25.290" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s really valuable</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.580" end="00:58:27.240" style="s2">it you know people have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.290" end="00:58:29.130" style="s2">this much more that then I will hear</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.240" end="00:58:31.380" style="s2">about the able kind of third person in</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.130" end="00:58:33.000" style="s2">oneself and get out of the see oneself</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.380" end="00:58:33.690" style="s2">in the scenario in order to make better</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.000" end="00:58:36.750" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.690" end="00:58:38.700" style="s2">I think that&#39;s useful under for certain</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.750" end="00:58:42.990" style="s2">professions and certainly certain people</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.700" end="00:58:45.800" style="s2">I I think that what people you know talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.990" end="00:58:48.150" style="s2">about capacity you know I think that</p>

<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:10.800" style="s2">start to feel more powerful as a human</p>

<p begin="01:01:13.310" end="01:01:17.640" style="s2">people are really just want to have</p>

<p begin="01:01:17.640" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">their surroundings and so knowing where</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.170" end="01:01:22.710" style="s2">those boundaries are and knowing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:24.870" style="s2">that there&#39;s a thick buffer between what</p>

<p begin="01:01:24.870" end="01:01:28.740" style="s2">you&#39;ll actually do is very powerful and</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.450" end="01:01:31.770" style="s2">this is the essence of a lot of martial</p>

<p begin="01:04:25.320" end="01:04:30.660" style="s2">after the Scientific Revolution we</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.770" end="01:04:32.940" style="s2">started understanding all of reality as</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.660" end="01:04:34.530" style="s2">objective because we could measure</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.940" end="01:04:36.390" style="s2">objective things we couldn&#39;t measure</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.530" end="01:04:38.040" style="s2">subjective things so objective became</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.390" end="01:04:39.510" style="s2">synonymous with real and we could</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.040" end="01:04:40.650" style="s2">measure comfort a lot better than we</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.510" end="01:04:42.060" style="s2">could measure happiness so we started</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.650" end="01:04:44.190" style="s2">making the world that optimized for it</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.060" end="01:04:46.620" style="s2">so we have more comfortable beds than</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.870" end="01:04:56.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand how to deal with that</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.100" end="01:04:57.780" style="s2">well and but one of the things that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.430" end="01:05:01.500" style="s2">wisdom traditions all did was</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.780" end="01:05:04.200" style="s2">intentionally induce discomfort to have</p>

<p begin="01:06:24.900" end="01:06:31.050" style="s2">terrible you know these days and frankly</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.610" end="01:06:32.790" style="s2">my entire life I&#39;ve tried to surround</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.050" end="01:06:34.710" style="s2">myself with people that were seeking to</p>

<p begin="01:06:39.880" end="01:06:42.790" style="s2">of people but in general it feels really</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.590" end="01:06:43.900" style="s2">good to be around people that are trying</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.790" end="01:06:44.470" style="s2">to become the better version of</p>

<p begin="01:06:44.470" end="01:06:48.310" style="s2">I would assert that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.970" end="01:06:50.140" style="s2">impossible maybe impossible to become</p>

<p begin="01:06:52.060" end="01:06:57.580" style="s2">stress and I think that boils down to</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.730" end="01:06:59.560" style="s2">the core missus idea it boils down to</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.580" end="01:07:01.240" style="s2">the hans selye who won the nobel prize</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.560" end="01:07:03.820" style="s2">for general general adaptation syndrome</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.240" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">yes you have distress any of you stress</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.820" end="01:07:08.230" style="s2">but that you become a stronger better</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:10.060" style="s2">neural organism you become a stronger</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.230" end="01:07:12.670" style="s2">better physical organism by placing</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.060" end="01:07:14.680" style="s2">yourself into reasonable scenarios or</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.670" end="01:07:16.060" style="s2">sometimes unreasonable scenarios in</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.680" end="01:07:17.860" style="s2">which you experience stress and have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.060" end="01:07:20.530" style="s2">work your way through it survive it</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.860" end="01:07:23.730" style="s2">compensate and show up better and so I</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.530" end="01:07:28.540" style="s2">think that purely positive emotions</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.730" end="01:07:31.780" style="s2">would be terrible and I&#39;d go back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.540" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">this human study this Heath 1963 science</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.780" end="01:07:35.950" style="s2">paper these patients there were patients</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:39.640" style="s2">because they had electrodes in the brain</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.950" end="01:07:42.910" style="s2">for other reasons but they were it was a</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.640" end="01:07:45.490" style="s2">it was available to them to stimulate</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.910" end="01:07:47.050" style="s2">any brain area including areas that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.490" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">stimulate pleasure and they did</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.050" end="01:07:52.840" style="s2">stimulate those brain areas but they</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:55.210" style="s2">preferred more than any other experience</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.840" end="01:07:57.640" style="s2">and was their preferred experience was</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.210" end="01:07:58.510" style="s2">some low-level frustration on the effort</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.640" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.510" end="01:08:03.340" style="s2">fundamentally important in that in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:05.890" style="s2">result it needs to be repeated but I</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.340" end="01:08:08.740" style="s2">think that the human species evolved by</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.890" end="01:08:10.840" style="s2">challenging itself and frustration and</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.740" end="01:08:13.060" style="s2">confusion these days I think a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.840" end="01:08:15.460" style="s2">how confusion and frustration actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.060" end="01:08:16.720" style="s2">might be the neural circuits testing out</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.460" end="01:08:18.970" style="s2">different arrangements of firing</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.720" end="01:08:20.740" style="s2">patterns makes sense I mean we need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.970" end="01:08:22.480" style="s2">test that we need to evaluate that in</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.740" end="01:08:23.799" style="s2">first and animal models than the human</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.480" end="01:08:26.680" style="s2">models to really get down to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.799" end="01:08:28.299" style="s2">mechanistic guts of it but you know it</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.680" end="01:08:29.890" style="s2">changes the way that I feel when I read</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.299" end="01:08:31.029" style="s2">something and I go I didn&#39;t even absorb</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.890" end="01:08:33.880" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m gonna go back again</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.029" end="01:08:36.520" style="s2">maybe this is my brain trying to absorb</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.880" end="01:08:38.140" style="s2">things take some sleep wake up the next</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.520" end="01:08:40.870" style="s2">day and boom you have the ideas it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.140" end="01:08:42.220" style="s2">those small bits of pain and pushing</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.870" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">yourself up against the boundaries it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.220" end="01:08:49.120" style="s2">not unlike physical practices so I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.640" end="01:08:50.410" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re rapidly gaining</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.120" end="01:08:51.910" style="s2">understanding in this</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.410" end="01:08:53.050" style="s2">not just in the science domain but in</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.910" end="01:08:54.940" style="s2">the practical application of</p>

<p begin="01:08:54.940" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">you work in and I think it&#39;s exciting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.390" end="01:09:02.680" style="s2">see where all this is gonna lead a</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:05.260" style="s2">episode that&#39;s what our species was</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.680" end="01:09:07.420" style="s2">designed to do was to evolve itself so I</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.260" end="01:09:10.330" style="s2">really love this 1963 paper that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.420" end="01:09:12.070" style="s2">referencing because from an Evo Devo</p>

<p begin="01:09:30.580" end="01:09:34.089" style="s2">actually pass down there&#39;s a deeper</p>

<p begin="01:09:51.550" end="01:09:55.570" style="s2">sense right and most of the other</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.070" end="01:09:58.690" style="s2">creatures are tremendously more</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.570" end="01:09:59.860" style="s2">hardwired than we are and so to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.690" end="01:10:04.750" style="s2">creatures that have so much</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.860" end="01:10:07.240" style="s2">developmental capacity and to see what a</p>

<p begin="01:10:07.240" end="01:10:11.020" style="s2">on actualizing that and why</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.090" end="01:10:13.300" style="s2">self-actualization is at the top of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.020" end="01:10:16.120" style="s2">pyramid it&#39;s a yeah it makes a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.300" end="01:10:18.190" style="s2">evolutionary biology sense yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.120" end="01:10:23.980" style="s2">I mean again I we&#39;re gonna get into</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.190" end="01:10:26.590" style="s2">plasticity our species what the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.980" end="01:10:29.230" style="s2">we&#39;re different than honeybee or a bear</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.590" end="01:10:31.930" style="s2">or another or a tiger for that matter is</p>

<p begin="01:12:23.160" end="01:12:26.430" style="s2">family line that are gonna be very</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.350" end="01:12:27.540" style="s2">important I mean it sounds a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.430" end="01:12:29.820" style="s2">eugenic but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:12:29.820" end="01:12:33.030" style="s2">kids feel safe they behave very</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.590" end="01:12:35.670" style="s2">differently than when they don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.030" end="01:12:39.180" style="s2">safe same with adults right and adults</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.670" end="01:12:40.680" style="s2">who don&#39;t feel safe feel the exact same</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.180" end="01:12:42.570" style="s2">things that children do I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.680" end="01:12:44.489" style="s2">Freud that&#39;s guys I looked there to</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.570" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">quotes and sort of run in parallel and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.489" end="01:12:49.650" style="s2">always come back to so Freud had the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:53.070" style="s2">saying anxiety makes children of us all</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.650" end="01:12:55.110" style="s2">and and I would add to that except that</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.070" end="01:12:58.790" style="s2">as adults we use adult tools to respond</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.110" end="01:13:01.410" style="s2">to pry and you know in our pillows or</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.790" end="01:13:02.670" style="s2">some people might do that violence and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.410" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">they say horrible things and they get</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.670" end="01:13:05.070" style="s2">revenge and do all sorts of horrible</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:07.230" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.070" end="01:13:09.300" style="s2">so anxiety makes children of us all and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.230" end="01:13:11.910" style="s2">I think it was I don&#39;t know maybe was</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.300" end="01:13:13.500" style="s2">Vince Lombardi or maybe it was it was</p>

<p begin="01:13:13.500" end="01:13:17.820" style="s2">said you</p>

<p begin="01:13:17.820" end="01:13:23.250" style="s2">those are go hand in hand right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.800" end="01:13:26.040" style="s2">fatigue the point being that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.250" end="01:13:28.380" style="s2">opposite is also true that when you feel</p>

<p begin="01:13:28.380" end="01:13:32.610" style="s2">decisions about the kind of creative and</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.630" end="01:13:35.340" style="s2">expansive life you want you want to live</p>

<p begin="01:13:37.170" end="01:13:41.250" style="s2">but you can imagine what it&#39;s like to</p>

<p begin="01:13:50.940" end="01:13:54.180" style="s2">say wow you know I mean the outcomes are</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.380" end="01:13:56.820" style="s2">distinctly different so it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.180" end="01:13:59.120" style="s2">responsibility I think as individuals to</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.820" end="01:14:01.830" style="s2">what you engage in what I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.120" end="01:14:05.670" style="s2">self-directed adaptive plasticity right</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.830" end="01:14:09.719" style="s2">you know to be able to find tools you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.670" end="01:14:11.730" style="s2">apply tools and for self-directed</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.719" end="01:14:13.500" style="s2">adaptive Plassey there&#39;s no better</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.730" end="01:14:15.150" style="s2">coping and better coping means that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.500" end="01:14:16.890" style="s2">can navigate your life better you can</p>

<p begin="01:14:19.050" end="01:14:23.520" style="s2">people doing that right one of the great</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.450" end="01:14:25.890" style="s2">those of the nirakar collective and</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.520" end="01:14:28.020" style="s2">others as well is if you can if we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.890" end="01:14:30.120" style="s2">do that insufficient than large numbers</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.020" end="01:14:31.530" style="s2">of people we&#39;re gonna see a massive</p>

<p begin="01:14:45.300" end="01:14:51.090" style="s2">yet it reminds me and you know we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.380" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll close there&#39;s so many places we</p>

<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:14:57.420" style="s2">for number two when we come and actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.510" end="01:14:59.310" style="s2">get into how to do self-directed</p>

<p begin="01:15:02.280" end="01:15:07.190" style="s2">to you but it was a literature review on</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.260" end="01:15:09.570" style="s2">adult neural restructuring and so it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.190" end="01:15:12.630" style="s2">neurogenesis Naruto faggy synaptogenesis</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.570" end="01:15:15.060" style="s2">and synaptic cleaving and to show that</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.060" end="01:15:17.790" style="s2">you&#39;re not screwed if you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.050" end="01:15:19.980" style="s2">childhood right and that you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.790" end="01:15:23.489" style="s2">actually radically through many methods</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.980" end="01:15:28.139" style="s2">increase neural restructuring of all</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.489" end="01:15:29.459" style="s2">kinds and so I&#39;ll send it to you</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.139" end="01:15:31.409" style="s2">love to get your feedback on it maybe</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.459" end="01:15:33.840" style="s2">before we do this next one on on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.409" end="01:15:36.329" style="s2">topic yeah I&#39;d love to take a read I</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.840" end="01:15:38.489" style="s2">mean I think that it&#39;s true you know you</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.329" end="01:15:42.869" style="s2">had this amazing window plasticity early</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.489" end="01:15:45.349" style="s2">in life but for better for worse you</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.869" end="01:15:47.669" style="s2">weren&#39;t in the driver&#39;s seat with no</p>

<p begin="01:15:58.229" end="01:16:04.050" style="s2">can just take what you got and run the</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.539" end="01:16:06.090" style="s2">run the gears as they exist and so I</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.050" end="01:16:07.949" style="s2">think it&#39;s our responsibility as human</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.090" end="01:16:10.889" style="s2">beings because our species is a</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.219" end="01:16:22.860" style="s2">update our neural architecture in a way</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.099" end="01:16:24.840" style="s2">that allows us to show up better in the</p>
