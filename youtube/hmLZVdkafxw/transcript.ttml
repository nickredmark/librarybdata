<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.380" style="s2">all right I was gonna talk about a much</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.890" end="00:00:05.879" style="s2">more controversial topic today so I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:08.130" style="s2">spending like an hour trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.879" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">things together and so I&#39;ve done very</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:12.210" style="s2">little prep for this one but I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:14.429" style="s2">it&#39;s just about telling my story as</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.210" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">opposed to global incentives incentives</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.429" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">matter for sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:22.109" style="s2">but money is one incentive one way to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">incentivize people in fact money is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.109" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">placeholder for the actual incentives of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:28.019" style="s2">like are you seeking power</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:30.330" style="s2">are you seeking security are you seeking</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.019" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">freedom what is it that money brings you</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.330" end="00:00:36.210" style="s2">I think one of the best questions to ask</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:38.820" style="s2">for people leaving school or going into</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.210" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">university probably before you go to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.820" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">university what are you gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:46.410" style="s2">university is looking at what you would</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">do for free looking at what calls you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.410" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">beyond money because that is its own or</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">in and of itself if the reward is in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">doing you don&#39;t need the monetary</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">incentives and so I should have paid</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">more notes cuz I was like my story have</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">incentive um the reason I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:09.650" style="s2">video is somebody commented yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:11.850" style="s2">aren&#39;t one of my videos about this this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.650" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">rhetoric that gets said a lot which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.850" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">like well what if like what is the poor</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">have as an incentive if we just like</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">give the money so my story it is I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">poor and I am on disability which is why</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">I&#39;m poor and my incentive to create a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.420" style="s2">better world doesn&#39;t come to make money</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:37.290" style="s2">on it in fact I am disincentivize my</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">money I&#39;m like my needs are covered but</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:42.979" style="s2">and I have very limited energy and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:46.350" style="s2">still want to spend some of that doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.979" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">this work for the greater good both</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">because I&#39;m gonna benefit from it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s what I&#39;m capable of and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">it&#39;s what I will do for free it is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">calls to me it is what every cell of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">being is like do this it&#39;s fun the doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">even if nothing ever comes from it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">enjoying the process of it and so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">incentive is that the incentive is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">vision for a better world that I see is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">actually possible and so my only choice</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:13.340" style="s2">is to move towards bad because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:14.930" style="s2">I have to sit and make yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.340" end="00:02:24.739" style="s2">of just being in this society which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.930" end="00:02:27.170" style="s2">not so so great for me the incentives so</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.739" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">I very much because in my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.170" end="00:02:31.940" style="s2">life experienced it when you take away</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.790" end="00:02:33.319" style="s2">the need to work the like okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.940" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">still have food on the table you still</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.319" end="00:02:38.870" style="s2">have a roof over your head but you no</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:41.000" style="s2">longer need to work it doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.870" end="00:02:42.709" style="s2">stop needing to contribute it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.000" end="00:02:45.140" style="s2">mean you stop needing to have a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.709" end="00:02:47.239" style="s2">and in fact it said now a deeper purpose</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.140" end="00:02:48.950" style="s2">because instead of looking I had the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.239" end="00:02:50.870" style="s2">ability to work full time and now</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.950" end="00:02:52.489" style="s2">probably even part-time in somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.870" end="00:02:54.380" style="s2">else&#39;s employment where I have to follow</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.489" end="00:02:56.330" style="s2">those rules where I have to like get up</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.380" end="00:02:59.030" style="s2">at a certain time and not nap for two</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.330" end="00:03:00.709" style="s2">hours in the afternoon and be reliable</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.030" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">and things that are understandably</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.709" end="00:03:05.450" style="s2">needed by an employee</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.790" end="00:03:08.290" style="s2">I can&#39;t accommodate that so I can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.450" end="00:03:11.660" style="s2">but I can contribute from where I am and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.290" end="00:03:13.670" style="s2">the incentive isn&#39;t to make money the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.660" end="00:03:15.380" style="s2">incentive is to create something I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.670" end="00:03:16.760" style="s2">to create but if I have struggles</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.380" end="00:03:19.670" style="s2">because of the same disability that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.760" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">makes me poor I have struggles in how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.670" end="00:03:23.750" style="s2">create it in the normal system but I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:27.470" style="s2">foresee I can see all the ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.750" end="00:03:28.670" style="s2">can we can help each other create so if</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.470" end="00:03:29.780" style="s2">you&#39;re not a good communicator you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.670" end="00:03:31.459" style="s2">find someone to communicate and if</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.780" end="00:03:34.459" style="s2">you&#39;re not great at the financial piece</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.459" end="00:03:36.739" style="s2">you can find that and the incentive for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.459" end="00:03:39.319" style="s2">all of those people is like you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.739" end="00:03:40.790" style="s2">hate finances and spreadsheets so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.319" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">think you could only ever pay an</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.790" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">accountant to be an accountant people</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:46.940" style="s2">who are accounting true people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:49.100" style="s2">accountants like people who would do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.940" end="00:03:52.190" style="s2">without the money are better at it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.100" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">they love it so yeah you can find</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.190" end="00:03:55.970" style="s2">accountants that will do accounting</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:59.170" style="s2">because we all have different things</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.970" end="00:04:01.790" style="s2">that draw us in so the incentive to look</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.170" end="00:04:04.609" style="s2">to help each other find what our passion</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.790" end="00:04:07.340" style="s2">is because the more I help other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.609" end="00:04:09.049" style="s2">find their accounting passion I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.340" end="00:04:11.540" style="s2">have to do accounting before I help</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.049" end="00:04:12.769" style="s2">people find their graphic artist I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.540" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">have to do and I&#39;m not doing any of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.769" end="00:04:20.660" style="s2">those things so I think it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:22.070" style="s2">the 1% who&#39;s like and if the poor is</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.660" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">very much used against the middle class</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.070" end="00:04:27.699" style="s2">look what could happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:28.540" style="s2">right but when you take away I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.699" end="00:04:31.000" style="s2">know in the hall I could do a whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.540" end="00:04:33.370" style="s2">video on poverty and incentives and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.000" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">ridiculousness of social programs that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.370" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">do incentivize people to stay on it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:41.889" style="s2">because of the way it&#39;s created more so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:44.680" style="s2">than because and then poor people act in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.889" end="00:04:46.600" style="s2">their best interest in how economic says</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.680" end="00:04:49.810" style="s2">you should act and we look at them badly</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.600" end="00:04:51.400" style="s2">like well does it make sense to work for</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.810" end="00:04:53.470" style="s2">free does it make sense to work for</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.400" end="00:04:55.720" style="s2">negative money does it make sense no it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.470" end="00:04:58.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and would you so at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.720" end="00:04:59.889" style="s2">time we&#39;re like oh you&#39;re inside like we</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.330" end="00:05:03.010" style="s2">are incentivizing people to stay on</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.889" end="00:05:05.200" style="s2">benefits but taking those benefits away</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.010" end="00:05:07.690" style="s2">is not helpful we have to incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.200" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">them to find a Colleen to find something</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.690" end="00:05:11.770" style="s2">and then contribute to society well</p>
