<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:50.579" style="s2">my career arc reflects a principle I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:53.159" style="s2">be talking about more in terms of living</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.579" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">your life as an experiment continually</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.159" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">refining your clarity for what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:02:58.470" style="s2">ultimately going to be meaningful to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">and where you can best deploy your</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">talents so going back to Bridgewater the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:04.139" style="s2">one thing that you said that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:06.060" style="s2">know that I&#39;m on the same page with is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.139" end="00:03:08.849" style="s2">Ray Dalio as the root of all evil I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.060" end="00:03:10.650" style="s2">think he has his flaws as do as do all</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.849" end="00:03:13.859" style="s2">of us but I actually got a ton of value</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.650" end="00:03:16.349" style="s2">out of my time there and the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.859" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">that ended up having me decide to leave</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.349" end="00:03:19.109" style="s2">was actually something that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">encouraged which is thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.109" end="00:03:23.549" style="s2">economic fundamentals and being</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">relentlessly curious about how does all</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.549" end="00:03:27.870" style="s2">of this actually work when you drop the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:30.329" style="s2">academic jargon when you drop the theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.870" end="00:03:32.760" style="s2">how does any of this actually work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.329" end="00:03:34.829" style="s2">there was a white paper that was put out</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.760" end="00:03:37.349" style="s2">a couple of years into my tenure there</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.829" end="00:03:39.510" style="s2">where it was talking about how the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.349" end="00:03:41.370" style="s2">economic machine works and there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.510" end="00:03:44.310" style="s2">this underlying assumption that it all</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.370" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">started off with that productivity can</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.310" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">be expected to grow sort of ad infinitum</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">for you know around 0.5 to 1.5% globally</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:58.109" style="s2">and I read it and it just sort of blew</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:03:59.790" style="s2">my mind because on one hand if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.109" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">trying to you know trade on a three to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.790" end="00:04:04.109" style="s2">six month time horizon mostly on debt</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:06.540" style="s2">and business cycles then fine it works</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.109" end="00:04:09.000" style="s2">as a simplifying assumption but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.540" end="00:04:13.260" style="s2">begged the question why would you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.000" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.260" end="00:04:17.720" style="s2">claim to make divorced from sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:20.010" style="s2">underlying drivers of what actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.720" end="00:04:23.219" style="s2">creates productivity what actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.010" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">creates value and that question led me</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.219" end="00:04:27.380" style="s2">down this whole rabbit hole of heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:30.230" style="s2">economic thinkers an environment</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.380" end="00:04:33.410" style="s2">thinkers EF Schumacher was huge in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.230" end="00:04:35.510" style="s2">perspective at that time and I decided</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.410" end="00:04:37.850" style="s2">one day to basically just up and leave</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.510" end="00:04:39.860" style="s2">which is sort of unusual Ford water</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.850" end="00:04:44.150" style="s2">usually ends up kicking people out and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.860" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">in that case I decided that my path</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.150" end="00:04:48.920" style="s2">needed to go after this question of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">actually creates value that I was no</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.920" end="00:04:53.060" style="s2">longer satisfied to sort of solve the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:55.130" style="s2">puzzles around these little Wiggles on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.060" end="00:04:57.470" style="s2">in the market but what actually drives</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.130" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">value in the world and how can I be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.470" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">part of creating that what is my highest</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:07.040" style="s2">use towards that end and so I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:10.220" style="s2">going on a journey around the world with</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.040" end="00:05:12.710" style="s2">my extremely patient wife to check out</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.220" end="00:05:15.260" style="s2">all of the people who claimed that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.710" end="00:05:17.690" style="s2">were doing this that they were taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.260" end="00:05:20.570" style="s2">another shot at the fundamentals of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.690" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">to organize economic activity so ended</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.570" end="00:05:25.220" style="s2">up in a variety of different eco</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">villages I volunteered on a on a farm</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.220" end="00:05:29.990" style="s2">for a bit studied permaculture study</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:33.290" style="s2">different forestry management techniques</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.990" end="00:05:35.180" style="s2">got involved with transition towns which</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.290" end="00:05:37.610" style="s2">is based at totnes England with Rob</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.180" end="00:05:41.810" style="s2">Hopkins did all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.610" end="00:05:44.900" style="s2">things some degrowth activism and all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.810" end="00:05:46.220" style="s2">it was based around this idea of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.900" end="00:05:47.870" style="s2">know if some of the things I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.220" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about on your show before</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.870" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">right that when you have essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2">Neil if the cognition dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">exponential growth and exponential</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.100" end="00:06:02.360" style="s2">technology that you&#39;re inevitably headed</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:04.610" style="s2">for a wall so that idea led me to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.360" end="00:06:07.130" style="s2">concept that okay given my background</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.610" end="00:06:10.190" style="s2">given that particular view of the system</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.130" end="00:06:12.860" style="s2">what can I do and the answer to me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.190" end="00:06:14.600" style="s2">seemed clearest was okay I need to help</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.860" end="00:06:16.430" style="s2">formulate a new narrative around money</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.600" end="00:06:18.620" style="s2">because that&#39;s how we allocate resources</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.430" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">in our society and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.620" end="00:06:24.410" style="s2">shifting capital from the current game</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:26.540" style="s2">which is which is optimizing for sort of</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.710" end="00:06:51.540" style="s2">talking about that and that was what led</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.390" end="00:06:53.400" style="s2">me to slow money great that&#39;s quite an</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.640" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">really has been I think a Fountainhead</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.710" end="00:07:06.750" style="s2">of rethinking about how you relate</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">capital to building real value and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.750" end="00:07:11.880" style="s2">real value means beyond just short-term</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:13.920" style="s2">money on money return ya know I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.880" end="00:07:17.220" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that&#39;s absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.920" end="00:07:21.690" style="s2">and the place and the place where that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.220" end="00:07:23.370" style="s2">breaks down to be honest is that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.690" end="00:07:27.420" style="s2">have to actually be able to out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.370" end="00:07:30.180" style="s2">the existing system and none none of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.420" end="00:07:33.540" style="s2">responses that I saw from you know the</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.300" end="00:07:50.370" style="s2">that we have the existing game was still</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.450" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">allocating resources and still</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.090" end="00:08:00.420" style="s2">they win and that ultimately prevented</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.710" end="00:08:12.360" style="s2">no organization that&#39;s the beauty of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.090" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">a movement called game B and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.360" end="00:08:16.410" style="s2">call the status quo the system as it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:18.600" style="s2">game a you know and one of our deep</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.600" end="00:08:22.980" style="s2">drive away the hippie-dippie z&#39; is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.940" end="00:08:25.080" style="s2">we talk about the fact that game B must</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.980" end="00:08:28.200" style="s2">become good enough at things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.080" end="00:08:30.180" style="s2">coherence and sovereignty and working in</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.200" end="00:08:31.140" style="s2">a high impactful way to actually be able</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.140" end="00:08:36.780" style="s2">game a at least in some niches and to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.450" end="00:08:38.760" style="s2">therefore parasitize game a and pull</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.780" end="00:08:41.340" style="s2">resources out of game a that we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.760" end="00:08:44.219" style="s2">reinvest in building game B I&#39;m with you</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.340" end="00:08:46.290" style="s2">100% that you know what comes next will</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.219" end="00:08:48.990" style="s2">not come from wishful thinking it has to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.290" end="00:08:50.100" style="s2">come from good thinking combined with</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.100" end="00:08:55.820" style="s2">yeah and that and that question of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.630" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">how do you actually how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.820" end="00:09:01.070" style="s2">design for for the things you&#39;re naming</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.600" end="00:09:07.460" style="s2">effectively that&#39;s the question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.480" end="00:09:09.830" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;m now obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.460" end="00:09:12.710" style="s2">that has led me serve on this on the on</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.830" end="00:09:14.870" style="s2">the rest of my career journey is what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.710" end="00:09:16.850" style="s2">the what is actually the key leverage</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.870" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">point or key leverage points that will</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.850" end="00:09:22.040" style="s2">enable that to happen you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:25.910" style="s2">at this point the notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.040" end="00:09:27.620" style="s2">existing game a is in some sense self</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.910" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">terminating that it&#39;s no longer meeting</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.620" end="00:09:32.510" style="s2">the needs of the majority of people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:35.750" style="s2">play it etc etc that&#39;s becoming sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.510" end="00:09:37.250" style="s2">shockingly widespread since the when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.750" end="00:09:40.040" style="s2">was working with some you know dealing</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.250" end="00:09:44.210" style="s2">with the D growth folks back in you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.040" end="00:09:46.040" style="s2">the what I guess was like 2012 2013 it</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.210" end="00:09:47.980" style="s2">was absolutely fringe and now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">seeing that as sort of part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.980" end="00:09:52.340" style="s2">increasingly sort of the mainstream left</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:55.100" style="s2">dialog which is which has been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.340" end="00:09:56.780" style="s2">wild to see yet it&#39;s quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.100" end="00:09:59.750" style="s2">how you know we started the game B</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.780" end="00:10:01.640" style="s2">movement in January 2013 and we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.750" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">just a bunch of Fringe Kooks at that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.640" end="00:10:06.230" style="s2">point and now we&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:07.730" style="s2">exponentially the time is right and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.230" end="00:10:10.610" style="s2">prediction is that one of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.610" end="00:10:14.810" style="s2">epidemic is going to be the ears to hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.860" end="00:10:17.060" style="s2">are gonna increase by at least a factor</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.810" end="00:10:19.160" style="s2">of 10 for the next nine to twelve months</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.060" end="00:10:21.020" style="s2">this is the kind of wake up call where</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.160" end="00:10:23.840" style="s2">people for once are heaved out of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.020" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">glassy hammock of Western high gloss</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.840" end="00:10:27.470" style="s2">civilization and thrown on their ass and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:29.300" style="s2">have to think for themselves a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.470" end="00:10:31.640" style="s2">bit and I suspect one of the side</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.300" end="00:10:33.320" style="s2">effects is gonna be opening their minds</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.640" end="00:10:35.660" style="s2">to realize this isn&#39;t the only game in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.320" end="00:10:38.600" style="s2">town I certainly hope so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.660" end="00:10:40.580" style="s2">and that to me is often the blind spot</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.600" end="00:10:42.500" style="s2">in this kind of thinking right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.580" end="00:10:45.350" style="s2">then it&#39;s sort of the the way that most</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.500" end="00:10:48.140" style="s2">revolutions fail is a lot of focus on</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.350" end="00:10:50.120" style="s2">okay if the existing system breaks or if</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:52.130" style="s2">we can speed along that break then</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.120" end="00:10:54.980" style="s2">people will realize that we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.130" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">answers and the way that it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.980" end="00:10:59.750" style="s2">play out is oftentimes it&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.640" style="s2">that hard to tear down a system and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.750" end="00:11:03.589" style="s2">is remarkably hard to organize people</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.640" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">towards building something better the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.589" end="00:11:06.960" style="s2">the things that tend to fill those</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">sense-making gaps</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.960" end="00:11:09.870" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve I&#39;ve listened to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:11.460" style="s2">before talking about the different</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.870" end="00:11:13.890" style="s2">attractors right you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.460" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">particularly and these days likely you</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.890" end="00:11:18.390" style="s2">know technologically enabled fascism</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:21.270" style="s2">things like that so to me the question</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.390" end="00:11:24.690" style="s2">is okay if this is one of those moments</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.270" end="00:11:25.890" style="s2">and there&#39;s likely to be more we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.690" end="00:11:28.650" style="s2">know we&#39;re pretty we&#39;re pressing in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.890" end="00:11:30.450" style="s2">clutch and we&#39;re out of gear and we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.650" end="00:11:33.240" style="s2">an opportunity to choose a new gear that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.450" end="00:11:35.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to go into what is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.240" end="00:11:37.290" style="s2">underlying frame what is the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.160" end="00:11:39.110" style="s2">algorithm that actually tilts a</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">attractor yep and my own view I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:52.380" style="s2">to hear your view on this is I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:11:55.410" style="s2">most people are not too interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.380" end="00:11:57.810" style="s2">abstract talk and theory and that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.410" end="00:12:00.120" style="s2">way to really get people to move is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.810" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">actually show and so what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.120" end="00:12:04.170" style="s2">pushing in the game be world through the</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.920" end="00:12:15.300" style="s2">differ between them if we can actually</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.300" end="00:12:20.370" style="s2">show that we actually can out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.370" end="00:12:22.770" style="s2">game a at least in certain sectors then</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.370" end="00:12:24.900" style="s2">the number of people who are amenable to</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.630" end="00:12:53.790" style="s2">that you can&#39;t predict the unfolding of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.060" end="00:12:55.950" style="s2">a complex system very far and so one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.790" end="00:12:59.100" style="s2">got to actually go out there and do</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.740" end="00:13:05.250" style="s2">while being cognizant of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.570" end="00:13:07.530" style="s2">you&#39;re embedded in a very high</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.250" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">dimensional complex system and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.530" end="00:13:12.540" style="s2">almost all your responses are gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:14.850" style="s2">yes an anticipated effect but also some</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.540" end="00:13:19.350" style="s2">unanticipated effects so it&#39;s this kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.850" end="00:13:20.640" style="s2">of mix of epistemic modesty but also a</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.350" end="00:13:23.130" style="s2">bias toward action</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.640" end="00:13:25.079" style="s2">and thinking in high dimensional spaces</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.130" end="00:13:28.230" style="s2">that strikes me is how we move from</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.230" end="00:13:32.640" style="s2">percent aligned on that at least at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.720" end="00:13:35.339" style="s2">theory level right which is always in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.640" end="00:13:36.420" style="s2">trouble I like that that combination</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.420" end="00:13:43.380" style="s2">and a bias towards action that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.779" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">the heart of my focus and part of why</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.380" end="00:13:48.390" style="s2">I&#39;m excited about coaching and why I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.390" end="00:13:53.430" style="s2">into business is because I genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.269" end="00:13:55.290" style="s2">believe that there are some psycho</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.290" end="00:13:59.730" style="s2">shifts particularly for people operating</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.730" end="00:14:04.380" style="s2">demonstrate this and they don&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.529" end="00:14:11.190" style="s2">need to be bought in dead-even any</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.850" end="00:14:14.040" style="s2">particular set of ideals there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.190" end="00:14:15.690" style="s2">underlying shift in the same way that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.040" end="00:14:18.089" style="s2">became advantageous you know as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.690" end="00:14:20.040" style="s2">gotten to capitalism the simple shift of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.089" end="00:14:21.720" style="s2">oh the future might be the future is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.040" end="00:14:23.670" style="s2">likely to be better than the past</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.720" end="00:14:25.860" style="s2">therefore you should use your</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.670" end="00:14:28.380" style="s2">accumulated capital to invest in things</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.860" end="00:14:31.829" style="s2">that will return on that improving</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.380" end="00:14:33.930" style="s2">future that mindset shifted the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.829" end="00:14:36.899" style="s2">without even needing all of that much</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.930" end="00:14:38.850" style="s2">ideological buy-in and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.899" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">fundamental idea that I&#39;d love to get to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.850" end="00:14:45.779" style="s2">with you the notion of potential and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:48.510" style="s2">confusion and clarity that I believe can</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.779" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">be sort of the germ of that particularly</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.510" end="00:14:53.459" style="s2">when handed over to leaders who at this</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:55.560" style="s2">point given the way power laws work</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.459" end="00:14:58.140" style="s2">actually control the vast majority of</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:02.100" style="s2">love to talk about that but before we</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.029" end="00:15:04.170" style="s2">get to that let&#39;s dive in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.100" end="00:15:07.019" style="s2">into what it is you actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.170" end="00:15:08.820" style="s2">talent ISM I pulled down off the website</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.019" end="00:15:10.890" style="s2">something that I suppose you guys would</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.820" end="00:15:12.570" style="s2">call your mission statement though when</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.890" end="00:15:15.660" style="s2">I hear the word mission statement I want</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.570" end="00:15:17.940" style="s2">to go back which is we constantly</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:20.100" style="s2">explore and challenge the thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.940" end="00:15:23.850" style="s2">stands in the way of unleashing human</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.100" end="00:15:26.459" style="s2">potential including our own we consume</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.850" end="00:15:29.850" style="s2">scientific economic and behavioral data</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.459" end="00:15:31.709" style="s2">to test our approach and solutions we</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.850" end="00:15:34.230" style="s2">take our latest thinking and offer it</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.070" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">their hardest goals that&#39;s pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.980" end="00:15:48.150" style="s2">so let&#39;s start out with that as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:49.980" style="s2">framing and you know you can go from</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.150" end="00:15:52.200" style="s2">that and then put it in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.980" end="00:15:54.300" style="s2">why do game a people seek out your</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.200" end="00:15:56.070" style="s2">services what is it that they need what</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.300" end="00:15:59.910" style="s2">is it that you&#39;re delivering in the game</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.070" end="00:16:01.800" style="s2">a context yeah absolutely Jim I love the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.910" end="00:16:04.740" style="s2">question and and by the way I do share</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.800" end="00:16:06.780" style="s2">these sort of inherent vomit reflex when</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.740" end="00:16:09.630" style="s2">I when I hear mission statements most of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.780" end="00:16:11.280" style="s2">the time and in some ways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.630" end="00:16:13.530" style="s2">actually a reasonable place to start</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.280" end="00:16:15.750" style="s2">that there&#39;s this sort of inherent</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.530" end="00:16:18.150" style="s2">incoherence in the way that most of us</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.750" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">organize towards shared goals right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.150" end="00:16:23.010" style="s2">that&#39;s why mission statements by and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:25.230" style="s2">large are sets nonsense because they in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.010" end="00:16:27.390" style="s2">no way actually reflect with clarity the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.230" end="00:16:29.010" style="s2">reality of the eve of the leader who</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.390" end="00:16:32.640" style="s2">formulated them or the people that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.010" end="00:16:34.740" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to work with so why the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.640" end="00:16:38.340" style="s2">game a players use us why is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.740" end="00:16:40.500" style="s2">something what do we actually do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.340" end="00:16:42.450" style="s2">because it wins its but that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.500" end="00:16:46.770" style="s2">simple that&#39;s really what this boils</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.450" end="00:16:48.600" style="s2">down to and the reason why I think our</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.770" end="00:16:50.670" style="s2">approach wins relative to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.600" end="00:16:55.760" style="s2">seeing mostly being done in the market</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.670" end="00:16:57.840" style="s2">is it&#39;s a fundamental shift from</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.760" end="00:16:59.640" style="s2">accomplishing goals through the work of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.840" end="00:17:03.270" style="s2">others by commanding and controlling</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.640" end="00:17:05.400" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing to unleashing their</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.270" end="00:17:08.400" style="s2">potential which ultimately is about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.400" end="00:17:11.130" style="s2">collective speed of learning and the</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:17.460" style="s2">made sense in a relatively low change</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.460" end="00:17:20.910" style="s2">needed people to interface with an</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.910" end="00:17:26.040" style="s2">day it made sense to say you go sit over</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.040" end="00:17:29.550" style="s2">to this other piece and that was a</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.700" end="00:19:23.110" style="s2">variable that I would add particularly</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.110" end="00:19:27.490" style="s2">because we&#39;re talking about humans</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.750" end="00:19:37.000" style="s2">is this so hard like at some level what</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.300" end="00:19:38.500" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is you know cutting</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:40.690" style="s2">through all the complexity is relatively</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.500" end="00:19:42.940" style="s2">simple like use your excess resources to</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.720" end="00:19:52.210" style="s2">that hard to play to run and yet nearly</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.620" end="00:20:01.389" style="s2">remember I did part of my career and you</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.029" end="00:20:19.690" style="s2">you&#39;ve entrenched yourself there and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.889" end="00:20:21.789" style="s2">guess what many of your hills are</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.690" end="00:20:25.629" style="s2">shrinking you know we were essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.789" end="00:20:27.479" style="s2">print and cd-rom publisher in 1992 right</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.629" end="00:20:29.829" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.479" end="00:20:33.759" style="s2">literally 90 percent of our revenue came</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.829" end="00:20:35.469" style="s2">from print and CD ROMs in 1992 and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.759" end="00:20:37.570" style="s2">were the fourth biggest in our industry</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.469" end="00:20:38.950" style="s2">but fortunately we were able to get the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.570" end="00:20:40.989" style="s2">attention of the powers that be and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.950" end="00:20:43.659" style="s2">convince him of this co-evolutionary</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.659" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">doing things differently and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.669" end="00:20:50.049" style="s2">started out competing our peers and by</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:52.329" style="s2">2000 we were number one in our category</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.049" end="00:20:54.459" style="s2">not bad right we did some smart things</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.329" end="00:20:57.190" style="s2">along the way like sold our newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.459" end="00:20:59.259" style="s2">at the top right moved our biggest most</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.190" end="00:21:02.709" style="s2">lucrative business from being mostly</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.259" end="00:21:04.869" style="s2">print bound to mostly online etc but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.709" end="00:21:07.059" style="s2">natural inclination of successful</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.869" end="00:21:10.239" style="s2">business people is to entrench where</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.059" end="00:21:11.979" style="s2">they are right let&#39;s squeeze 1% out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.239" end="00:21:14.709" style="s2">our cost this year and if we do we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.979" end="00:21:17.950" style="s2">get a gigantic bonus and it really takes</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.709" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">a whole bunch of leadership incentives</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.950" end="00:21:22.929" style="s2">compensation plans and above all else</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:25.029" style="s2">culture to overcome that natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.929" end="00:21:26.979" style="s2">tendency or at least you know the common</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.029" end="00:21:29.769" style="s2">tendency for people to entrench in place</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.979" end="00:21:32.409" style="s2">and defend their position so what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.769" end="00:21:35.469" style="s2">just laid out is the kernel of what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.409" end="00:21:38.019" style="s2">do at talent ISM what you just described</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.469" end="00:21:40.509" style="s2">is what I would call the path of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.019" end="00:21:42.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to take for</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.509" end="00:21:44.379" style="s2">businesses to actually win in such a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.279" end="00:21:46.719" style="s2">fast changing environment and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.379" end="00:21:48.700" style="s2">question that you&#39;re asking of why is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.719" end="00:21:52.479" style="s2">give him that that&#39;s a winning strategy</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.700" end="00:21:54.789" style="s2">do most people not follow it that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.479" end="00:21:56.619" style="s2">that is the driving question that we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.789" end="00:21:57.549" style="s2">after and that we work with people</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.619" end="00:22:00.129" style="s2">through in our different service</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.549" end="00:22:02.019" style="s2">offerings and you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.129" end="00:22:02.919" style="s2">another story I love along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.019" end="00:22:05.259" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about where</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.919" end="00:22:07.839" style="s2">blockbuster actually had a streaming</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.259" end="00:22:10.809" style="s2">service in the works before Netflix and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.839" end="00:22:11.769" style="s2">it got shit-canned by a group of VPS who</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.809" end="00:22:14.379" style="s2">were scared that it was going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.769" end="00:22:15.309" style="s2">cannibalize in-store sales that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.379" end="00:22:17.649" style="s2">classic in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.309" end="00:22:19.299" style="s2">phaidor&#39;s dilemma right one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.649" end="00:22:21.159" style="s2">business books suck and are not worth</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.299" end="00:22:22.779" style="s2">the dead trees that were sacrificed for</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.159" end="00:22:24.610" style="s2">him but the innovators dilemma what</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.779" end="00:22:27.460" style="s2">something Christensen that talks about</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.610" end="00:22:29.529" style="s2">exactly that and in a kind of a complex</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.460" end="00:22:31.570" style="s2">systems fashion that people to control</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.529" end="00:22:34.149" style="s2">the revenue also unfortunately control</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.570" end="00:22:36.039" style="s2">the investment which is an error and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.149" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">it&#39;s exceedingly hard to compete with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.039" end="00:22:43.960" style="s2">successful franchise from inside yes so</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:46.179" style="s2">what actually drives that and and ten</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.960" end="00:22:48.009" style="s2">that and can be behavior that drives</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.179" end="00:22:50.679" style="s2">that and the way to switch out of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.009" end="00:22:52.659" style="s2">actually be reduced to an to a</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.519" end="00:23:01.659" style="s2">the real question for me that would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.830" end="00:23:03.700" style="s2">gold if you have that so why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.659" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">tell us about we give a little bit of of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.700" end="00:23:08.619" style="s2">the cognitive science of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:12.369" style="s2">then pivot from there into your practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.619" end="00:23:14.909" style="s2">and your deliverables yes so at a at a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.369" end="00:23:18.580" style="s2">high level the core idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.909" end="00:23:21.249" style="s2">confusion that most of us most of the</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.929" end="00:23:40.360" style="s2">we are experiencing and this is deeply</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.120" end="00:25:25.720" style="s2">and maybe this is a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.040" end="00:25:28.200" style="s2">tiger that doesn&#39;t want to eat me</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.720" end="00:25:31.720" style="s2">you&#39;re dead automatically you&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.200" end="00:25:33.700" style="s2">just run just run away from the tiger</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.720" end="00:25:36.370" style="s2">and so we have a whole set of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.700" end="00:25:39.100" style="s2">architecture devoted to taking offline</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.370" end="00:25:40.900" style="s2">our ability to step back and do complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:42.730" style="s2">thinking what Daniel Kahneman calls our</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.900" end="00:25:45.310" style="s2">type two thinking right that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.730" end="00:25:47.080" style="s2">step back and break down a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.310" end="00:25:50.560" style="s2">go through first principles and put hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.080" end="00:25:53.170" style="s2">thinking into it that turns off most of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.560" end="00:25:55.810" style="s2">the time when facing something new and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.170" end="00:25:58.300" style="s2">the problem with that right is that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.810" end="00:26:00.490" style="s2">our current environment our problems</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.300" end="00:26:03.400" style="s2">most of the time aren&#39;t simple they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.490" end="00:26:07.510" style="s2">actually complex right and complex</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.400" end="00:26:10.300" style="s2">problems don&#39;t respond well to taking</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.510" end="00:26:13.000" style="s2">our higher-level cognition offline so</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.300" end="00:26:14.620" style="s2">the net result of that right is people</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.000" end="00:26:16.360" style="s2">get faced with things that don&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.620" end="00:26:19.540" style="s2">their mental model they get confused</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.360" end="00:26:22.390" style="s2">that confusion rapidly converts into a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.540" end="00:26:23.620" style="s2">biological threat response and then the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.390" end="00:26:25.690" style="s2">way that you&#39;ve resolved that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.620" end="00:26:27.460" style="s2">particularly in a complex system where</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.690" end="00:26:29.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t kind of get the catharsis of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.460" end="00:26:32.050" style="s2">having actually run away from the tiger</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.320" end="00:26:34.120" style="s2">is you retreat into certainty you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.050" end="00:26:36.340" style="s2">basically double down on your existing</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.120" end="00:26:38.440" style="s2">mental model and so you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.340" end="00:26:40.990" style="s2">talking about say board dynamics or</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.440" end="00:26:41.800" style="s2">company dynamics something happens it</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.990" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:46.630" style="s2">want going to the blockbuster example</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.860" end="00:26:49.320" style="s2">you see sort of this streaming thing on</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.630" end="00:26:51.190" style="s2">the horizon whatever it is and you go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.320" end="00:26:54.520" style="s2">protective narratives you go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.190" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">certainty you go to yeah I know how all</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.520" end="00:26:58.870" style="s2">this works and I just need to defend</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">myself you know screw those screw those</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.870" end="00:27:03.040" style="s2">guys who are trying to take away my</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:04.750" style="s2">in-store sales screw that guy who wants</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.040" end="00:27:07.150" style="s2">my job screw that guy who wants the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.750" end="00:27:09.190" style="s2">credit whatever it is we retreat to</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.150" end="00:27:12.850" style="s2">these narratives that help us make sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.190" end="00:27:14.890" style="s2">of our ongoing threat by retreating to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.850" end="00:27:16.740" style="s2">things that we already know that can</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.890" end="00:27:19.420" style="s2">that we believe will protect us and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.740" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">path from confusion to threat to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.420" end="00:27:25.480" style="s2">certainty is the reason why most leaders</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:29.050" style="s2">and most businesses fail to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.480" end="00:27:32.230" style="s2">fail to unleash potential mmm I like it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.050" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">I like it a lot in fact it ties into one</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.230" end="00:27:35.230" style="s2">of my own theories of leadership I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.620" style="s2">love to get your thoughts on this</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.230" end="00:27:41.800" style="s2">distinction one of my key superpowers I</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.620" end="00:27:43.570" style="s2">think and I think my success at least is</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.800" end="00:27:44.920" style="s2">anecdotal evidence that it was true I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.570" end="00:27:47.710" style="s2">was pretty successful in my business</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.920" end="00:27:51.220" style="s2">career is that I concluded that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.710" end="00:27:55.060" style="s2">leadership was a mix of underlying</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.220" end="00:27:58.180" style="s2">innate almost probably genetic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.060" end="00:28:00.630" style="s2">some talent in certain domains</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.180" end="00:28:03.310" style="s2">you know like communications and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.630" end="00:28:05.530" style="s2">interpersonal skills and some skills</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.310" end="00:28:07.390" style="s2">that could be you know honed and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.530" end="00:28:10.030" style="s2">developed over time but let&#39;s get back</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.390" end="00:28:11.380" style="s2">to the innate part it&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.030" end="00:28:13.150" style="s2">eventually developed a system where I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.380" end="00:28:16.900" style="s2">said we have sort of innate leadership</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.150" end="00:28:19.810" style="s2">at the l1 l2 and l3 level L ones can</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.900" end="00:28:21.430" style="s2">lead a squad l2 s can lead a company</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.810" end="00:28:24.010" style="s2">accompany in the military sense a</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.430" end="00:28:27.280" style="s2">hundred people and l3 can lead anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.010" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">essentially and that the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.280" end="00:28:30.820" style="s2">underlying context of the sort you were</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:32.710" style="s2">talking about that by the way I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.820" end="00:28:34.570" style="s2">Sapolsky a little bit very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.710" end="00:28:36.820" style="s2">character and certainly somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.570" end="00:28:39.370" style="s2">thinking about response in extreme</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.820" end="00:28:40.870" style="s2">situations is very very valuable but</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.370" end="00:28:43.170" style="s2">anyway you know for instance I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.870" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">about myself I have a somewhat unusual</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.170" end="00:28:48.250" style="s2">wiring and then I&#39;m a fight not flight</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.690" style="s2">guy right as I tell people if I get into</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.250" end="00:28:51.550" style="s2">a business war with them I say you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.690" end="00:28:53.860" style="s2">you can kill me but you can&#39;t stop me</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.550" end="00:28:56.050" style="s2"> I will not run and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.860" end="00:28:56.710" style="s2">relatively unusual in business most</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.050" end="00:28:58.929" style="s2">business beef</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.710" end="00:29:01.510" style="s2">or pussies right and you put up</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.929" end="00:29:03.640" style="s2">a little fight and they fold and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.510" end="00:29:05.529" style="s2">know I also never fall into the fear</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.640" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">reaction it&#39;s just like why would I be</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.529" end="00:29:09.100" style="s2">fearful about something as trivial as</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:11.710" style="s2">business you know at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.100" end="00:29:13.210" style="s2">it&#39;s just a game as my wife and I used</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.710" end="00:29:15.010" style="s2">to always say particularly in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.210" end="00:29:17.380" style="s2">startup days when I did a number of</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.010" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">startups hey if we end up in a basement</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.380" end="00:29:21.370" style="s2">apartment back in Somerville</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:23.380" style="s2">Massachusetts who the cares right</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.370" end="00:29:25.000" style="s2">you know we&#39;re young we&#39;re talented we</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.380" end="00:29:26.409" style="s2">can you know do it again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.000" end="00:29:28.270" style="s2">again and we don&#39;t really give a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.409" end="00:29:30.760" style="s2">about status through things or any that</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.270" end="00:29:32.620" style="s2">kind of bad distractors however once I</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.760" end="00:29:34.899" style="s2">got into big corporation world it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.620" end="00:29:37.149" style="s2">very very different one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.899" end="00:29:39.730" style="s2">stories I won&#39;t name names but one guy</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.149" end="00:29:42.760" style="s2">that was in the c-level suite with me</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.730" end="00:29:45.100" style="s2">making a low seven-figure income I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.760" end="00:29:47.230" style="s2">Jesus Christ low seven-figure w-2 and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.100" end="00:29:49.090" style="s2">spending ten percent more than that how</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.230" end="00:29:51.340" style="s2">the hell could you even do it right but</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.090" end="00:29:54.909" style="s2">he managed and so what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.340" end="00:29:57.429" style="s2">he&#39;s holding on to his desk in desperate</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.909" end="00:29:58.990" style="s2">desperation there&#39;s nobody on earth that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.429" end="00:30:01.630" style="s2">would pay him what we were paying him at</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.990" end="00:30:03.730" style="s2">most 30 percent or 40 percent of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.630" end="00:30:06.700" style="s2">he&#39;s making and yet he somehow ratcheted</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.730" end="00:30:09.159" style="s2">up this insane lifestyle and so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.700" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">means that he is utterly in fear of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.159" end="00:30:14.289" style="s2">losing this ridiculously idiotic</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:16.419" style="s2">consumptive lifestyle should any</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.289" end="00:30:19.149" style="s2">perturbation happen that causes him to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.419" end="00:30:20.919" style="s2">lose this tit job and of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.149" end="00:30:22.419" style="s2">ironically that led him to make some bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.919" end="00:30:24.250" style="s2">decisions which caused him to be fired</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.419" end="00:30:27.490" style="s2">but to your point the short-term</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.250" end="00:30:30.580" style="s2">reaction was fear so at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.490" end="00:30:32.529" style="s2">when I&#39;m looking for high-level ELLs L 2</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.580" end="00:30:34.600" style="s2">s and L 3 s I&#39;m looking at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.529" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">for people who have the genetic right</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.600" end="00:30:38.770" style="s2">stuff you can teach the other stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:41.049" style="s2">they could have achieved it on other</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.770" end="00:30:43.870" style="s2">jobs but I&#39;m not convinced that high</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.049" end="00:30:46.450" style="s2">level leadership can be built that at</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.870" end="00:30:49.750" style="s2">least it requires a substrate of right</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.450" end="00:30:51.549" style="s2">cognitive type yeah I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.750" end="00:30:53.980" style="s2">mean listen I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.549" end="00:30:56.260" style="s2">nature-nurture debate to me by and large</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.980" end="00:30:58.360" style="s2">deserve a distraction like at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.260" end="00:30:59.799" style="s2">the day we we have certain we have we</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.360" end="00:31:01.330" style="s2">have certain potentialities built into</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.799" end="00:31:03.580" style="s2">our genetics and those in turn will be</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.330" end="00:31:05.260" style="s2">influenced by how they&#39;re deployed and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.580" end="00:31:07.210" style="s2">then that in turn will be deployed well</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.260" end="00:31:10.250" style="s2">be matched against the context that were</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.210" end="00:31:12.530" style="s2">in so one distinction that I would add</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.250" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">I think that its inherent in your story</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.530" end="00:31:19.010" style="s2">right is that that inherent response</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:22.550" style="s2">that you have of going to fight it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.010" end="00:31:24.110" style="s2">sounds like didn&#39;t work that well in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.550" end="00:31:26.570" style="s2">big structured corporate environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.110" end="00:31:28.390" style="s2">we&#39;re going to war wasn&#39;t an effective</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.180" end="00:31:42.770" style="s2"> right I would raise the ante as</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.460" end="00:31:44.810" style="s2">high as I could because I didn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.770" end="00:31:47.150" style="s2">right I was also being paid a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.810" end="00:31:49.910" style="s2">amount of money and I was living on 15%</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:21.530" style="s2">one of our big competitive advantages</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.490" end="00:32:23.390" style="s2">was we were trying to out-compete the</p>

<p begin="00:32:33.470" end="00:32:39.770" style="s2">due to administrative law to pay talent</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.400" end="00:32:41.630" style="s2">based on resume rather than quality</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.770" end="00:32:44.900" style="s2">which we arbitrage the out of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.630" end="00:32:47.270" style="s2">right we&#39;re able to sell the labor of a</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.270" end="00:32:51.620" style="s2">experience for this price right and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.090" end="00:32:53.450" style="s2">they just hired people based on their</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.620" end="00:32:54.800" style="s2">resumes and paid them all the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.450" end="00:32:57.080" style="s2">irrespective of their quality and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.800" end="00:32:58.850" style="s2">highly arbitrage we&#39;d pay the good ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.080" end="00:33:00.230" style="s2">twenty five thirty percent more guess</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.850" end="00:33:02.270" style="s2">what we got all the good ones they got</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.230" end="00:33:04.160" style="s2">all the steps but anyway we also armed</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.270" end="00:33:06.560" style="s2">on the drug testing well we didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.160" end="00:33:08.690" style="s2">make it explicit in our ads it came</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.560" end="00:33:10.010" style="s2">pretty close but we also definitely got</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.690" end="00:33:11.900" style="s2">the word out on the grapevine</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.010" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t do drug testing in fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.900" end="00:33:15.620" style="s2">everything else being equal if I found</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.390" style="s2">out you did acid once or twice a year</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.620" end="00:33:19.160" style="s2">that would be a plus right you&#39;d have a</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.820" end="00:33:52.289" style="s2">it and I go Norwell and then I sat down</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.460" end="00:33:54.510" style="s2">with my ghostwriter</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.289" end="00:33:56.279" style="s2">who was also my chief strategist nothing</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.510" end="00:33:58.980" style="s2">better to have a chief strategist he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.279" end="00:34:01.700" style="s2">also an impeccable wordsmith and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.980" end="00:34:05.220" style="s2">wrote a two-page letter to the CEO</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.700" end="00:34:08.550" style="s2">laying out our argument very forcefully</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.220" end="00:34:09.990" style="s2">and very not quite confrontational eek I</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.550" end="00:34:12.750" style="s2">had a great relationship with the CEO</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.990" end="00:34:15.179" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t say it but it was more or</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.750" end="00:34:17.460" style="s2">less him or me right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.179" end="00:34:20.010" style="s2">again do I really give a if they</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.460" end="00:34:22.710" style="s2">fire me no so I&#39;m willing to go all-in</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.010" end="00:34:25.710" style="s2">here they are sent the letter to the CEO</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.710" end="00:34:27.419" style="s2">and just sort of biding my time you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.710" end="00:34:28.770" style="s2">have no idea what will happen don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.419" end="00:34:31.320" style="s2">really care it&#39;s the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:33.270" style="s2">the next day I get a call from the CEO</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.320" end="00:34:35.849" style="s2">and he goes Jim you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.270" end="00:34:37.950" style="s2">this was ridiculous no you should not</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.849" end="00:34:39.389" style="s2">have to adhere to this policy it also</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.950" end="00:34:41.820" style="s2">violates although by the way our</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.389" end="00:34:44.609" style="s2">corporate doctrine of radical</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.820" end="00:34:46.919" style="s2">decentralization and so the next day he</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.609" end="00:34:49.500" style="s2">said to Heather Stern email to the head</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.919" end="00:34:52.099" style="s2">of HR saying independent business units</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.500" end="00:34:54.750" style="s2">may opt out of your policy end of story</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.099" end="00:34:57.060" style="s2">yeah and the headline might my main</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.750" end="00:34:58.770" style="s2">takeaway from this story is that your</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.060" end="00:35:01.770" style="s2">business was operating with cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.770" end="00:35:05.190" style="s2">clarity and that&#39;s the and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:07.290" style="s2">antidote to confusion like you were</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.190" end="00:35:08.970" style="s2">clear that you were that you were</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.290" end="00:35:10.650" style="s2">running an arbitrage in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.970" end="00:35:12.630" style="s2">way that you were going to index to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.650" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">talent no matter what that part of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.630" end="00:35:17.430" style="s2">culture was one where you weren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:18.810" style="s2">to overly index to policy stability or</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.430" end="00:35:20.310" style="s2">to the personal lives that your</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.810" end="00:35:21.750" style="s2">employees we&#39;re leading whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.310" end="00:35:23.670" style="s2">and that you are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.750" end="00:35:25.109" style="s2">compensating primarily on output and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.670" end="00:35:28.440" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t really care about much</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.109" end="00:35:30.510" style="s2">else right and so that cultural clarity</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.440" end="00:35:34.170" style="s2">allowed you to attract people like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.510" end="00:35:36.150" style="s2">and for your CEO to quickly help make</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.170" end="00:35:37.369" style="s2">sense of situations or someone like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.150" end="00:35:39.559" style="s2">HR director</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.369" end="00:35:41.180" style="s2">something contrary to that right which</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.559" end="00:35:43.700" style="s2">is not what you end up seeing at most</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.180" end="00:35:45.859" style="s2">companies yeah and we were I will say</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.700" end="00:35:48.019" style="s2">that this is what other thing I find so</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.859" end="00:35:49.609" style="s2">important in companies that I build and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.019" end="00:35:52.579" style="s2">we happen to have a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.609" end="00:35:56.299" style="s2">culture of radical decentralization at</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.579" end="00:35:58.009" style="s2">this big multinational where the default</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.299" end="00:36:00.259" style="s2">was if you run an independent business</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.009" end="00:36:01.309" style="s2">unit you have remarkable leverage do</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.259" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">what you want like some of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.309" end="00:36:05.240" style="s2">independent business units actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:07.640" style="s2">opted out of our corporate health care</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.240" end="00:36:09.079" style="s2">plan and what put out the bit and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.640" end="00:36:11.240" style="s2">independently got their own health care</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.079" end="00:36:14.539" style="s2">plan I mean that&#39;s pretty damn radical</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.240" end="00:36:17.089" style="s2">for a major corporation so to some sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.539" end="00:36:18.789" style="s2">I knew my battlefield bottom line was</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.089" end="00:36:21.470" style="s2">everything in this almost medieval</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.789" end="00:36:23.480" style="s2">decentralized Kingdom and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.470" end="00:36:26.390" style="s2">bottom line goddamn it and plus I had</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.480" end="00:36:28.279" style="s2">gigantic five stars for strategic change</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.390" end="00:36:30.589" style="s2">both within my unit and across the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.279" end="00:36:32.210" style="s2">company and I could appeal to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.589" end="00:36:34.940" style="s2">cultural norm of radical</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.210" end="00:36:36.859" style="s2">decentralization and so you know being a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:38.749" style="s2">warfighter you don&#39;t fight stupid Wars</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.859" end="00:36:41.240" style="s2">but you fight wars you have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.749" end="00:36:42.410" style="s2">chance to win and if that cultural basis</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.240" end="00:36:45.259" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been there radical</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.410" end="00:36:46.999" style="s2">decentralization even me mr. warfighter</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.259" end="00:36:49.009" style="s2">would have opted out of the fight has</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.999" end="00:36:51.680" style="s2">struck me that that cultural norm gave</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.009" end="00:36:53.509" style="s2">me a reasonable chance of victory yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.680" end="00:36:54.829" style="s2">and that piece of the cultural norm</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.509" end="00:36:58.670" style="s2">gives you a reasonable chance of victory</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.829" end="00:37:00.200" style="s2">is is I think pretty key I&#39;m curious and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.670" end="00:37:01.999" style="s2">feel free to skip the question or add it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.200" end="00:37:03.950" style="s2">out if it&#39;s overly personal but I does</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.999" end="00:37:08.869" style="s2">that warfighter impulse has it ever</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.950" end="00:37:10.910" style="s2">gotten you into trouble oh yeah I will</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.869" end="00:37:13.970" style="s2">say that I got my ass kicked a couple</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.910" end="00:37:17.989" style="s2">times when I was a teenager but in</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.970" end="00:37:20.269" style="s2">business no I would say that that I win</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.989" end="00:37:21.799" style="s2">every battle no but being a smart</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.269" end="00:37:25.549" style="s2">warfighter I generally had a fallback</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.799" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">position did I ever get fired know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.549" end="00:37:29.210" style="s2">I have bosses that probably thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:32.569" style="s2">about it yes but I would say net-net</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.210" end="00:37:35.960" style="s2">know my warfighter strategies are hugely</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.569" end="00:37:38.299" style="s2">net positive on a portfolio basis nice</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.960" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">well I&#39;m glad to hear it my my guess or</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.299" end="00:37:43.849" style="s2">at least my sense making around that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:45.559" style="s2">would be that part of that success is</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.849" end="00:37:48.049" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been good about choosing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.559" end="00:37:49.849" style="s2">your battlefields because what I have</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.049" end="00:37:51.300" style="s2">seen cases where people who have that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.849" end="00:37:54.060" style="s2">fight reflex</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.300" end="00:37:55.950" style="s2">and and aren&#39;t end up going to places</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.060" end="00:37:57.990" style="s2">where that fight reflex is outside of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.950" end="00:37:59.100" style="s2">the existing culture and then they</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.990" end="00:38:02.820" style="s2">confuse the out of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.100" end="00:38:06.000" style="s2">everyone gets confused by them they get</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.820" end="00:38:08.490" style="s2">confused and that usually goes badly so</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:10.770" style="s2">partially what I the way that I read</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.490" end="00:38:13.350" style="s2">your story is that your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.770" end="00:38:15.030" style="s2">choose places where that worked and</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.350" end="00:38:17.430" style="s2">effectively choose your battlefield that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.030" end="00:38:18.810" style="s2">you&#39;d be operating on and have clarity</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.430" end="00:38:21.330" style="s2">about the goals that you were actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.810" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">fighting for I would imagine that those</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.330" end="00:38:24.650" style="s2">were the ingredients of your success</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:27.360" style="s2">without knowing more about your story</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.650" end="00:38:29.850" style="s2">yeah I would say that&#39;s mostly the case</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.360" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">and then the other is that when the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.850" end="00:38:34.260" style="s2">battles were outside I wouldn&#39;t where it</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.710" end="00:38:35.820" style="s2">was actually a lot more fun is that most</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.260" end="00:38:37.290" style="s2">people are just afraid of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.820" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">fight you know particularly a fight that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.290" end="00:38:42.060" style="s2">they know will be a fight to the death</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">right and they flinch and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.060" end="00:38:45.450" style="s2">that was the other part I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.640" style="s2">could call that macro battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.450" end="00:38:49.530" style="s2">analysis you assess the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.640" end="00:38:52.110" style="s2">you realize that their leadership will</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.530" end="00:38:54.630" style="s2">definitely blink if you raise the lids</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.110" end="00:38:57.000" style="s2">on the ICBM they will definitely sue for</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.630" end="00:38:59.100" style="s2">peace so when the time comes and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.000" end="00:39:01.470" style="s2">have them at their weakest you raise the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.100" end="00:39:02.250" style="s2">lids on the ICBM and threaten nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.470" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">annihilation</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.250" end="00:39:06.330" style="s2">most people don&#39;t then raise their lids</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:08.070" style="s2">I guess oh that&#39;s probably good for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.330" end="00:39:09.630" style="s2">world but I think that&#39;s another reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.070" end="00:39:11.940" style="s2">particularly externally why bi</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.630" end="00:39:13.230" style="s2">warfighter strategy work pretty well but</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.940" end="00:39:15.240" style="s2">again you have to do it where you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.230" end="00:39:17.550" style="s2">the strategic position and my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.240" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">strategic battle I literally had a war</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.550" end="00:39:22.470" style="s2">room where we created eight scenarios on</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:25.110" style="s2">the white board from roll over and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.470" end="00:39:27.180" style="s2">submit to thermonuclear war and six</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.110" end="00:39:30.450" style="s2">different options in between we</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.180" end="00:39:32.040" style="s2">eventually chose option 6 which was to</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.450" end="00:39:34.530" style="s2">make them think we were going to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.040" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">nuclear war but actually be ready to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.530" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">settle and we call that strategy huff</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:41.850" style="s2">and puff and then settle it which worked</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:43.830" style="s2">perfectly I&#39;m glad I&#39;m glad to hear it</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.850" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">but anyway enough about my tails let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.830" end="00:39:48.630" style="s2">get back to your confusion and clarity</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:50.940" style="s2">and and all that how do you help people</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.630" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">get through that and increase their</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.940" end="00:39:56.910" style="s2">capability to do the right thing in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">rapidly changing world yes so if one</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.910" end="00:40:01.320" style="s2">branch and the branch that most people</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:03.359" style="s2">go down instinctively is confusion the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.320" end="00:40:06.049" style="s2">threat to certainty</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.359" end="00:40:10.140" style="s2">the the alternative that you have is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.049" end="00:40:12.630" style="s2">going to first to awareness so rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.140" end="00:40:14.729" style="s2">than being just aware that oh okay right</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.630" end="00:40:17.459" style="s2">I&#39;m probably confused right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.729" end="00:40:20.130" style="s2">right and that&#39;s actually an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.459" end="00:40:21.929" style="s2">step for most people because once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.130" end="00:40:23.819" style="s2">in that threat once you&#39;re in that space</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.929" end="00:40:26.669" style="s2">of going into that fight flight freeze</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.819" end="00:40:29.069" style="s2">reaction it&#39;s difficult to pull back</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.669" end="00:40:31.140" style="s2">right and that&#39;s where especially having</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.069" end="00:40:33.390" style="s2">external sense makers rather whether as</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.140" end="00:40:35.339" style="s2">other executives or a manager or a coach</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.390" end="00:40:37.769" style="s2">or whoever it is to help you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.339" end="00:40:40.469" style="s2">that you&#39;re confused at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.769" end="00:40:42.299" style="s2">sort of the first step once you</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.469" end="00:40:44.249" style="s2">recognize you&#39;re confused then you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.299" end="00:40:46.559" style="s2">actually get curious about it you can go</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.249" end="00:40:48.569" style="s2">okay what is my underlying mental model</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.559" end="00:40:51.659" style="s2">what isn&#39;t matching here what is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.569" end="00:40:55.079" style="s2">gap to expectation that&#39;s driving this</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.659" end="00:40:56.939" style="s2">reactivity innate and from there you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.079" end="00:41:00.419" style="s2">reorient to your intentional goal</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.939" end="00:41:03.409" style="s2">because what gets lost right on the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.419" end="00:41:07.169" style="s2">to that path to certainty is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.409" end="00:41:09.869" style="s2">aperture focuses down to how to protect</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.169" end="00:41:11.699" style="s2">oneself rather than how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.869" end="00:41:13.819" style="s2">win how do you win against your bigger</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.699" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">goals right and this is where you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.819" end="00:41:17.669" style="s2">executive team sort of endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:19.439" style="s2">bickering or retreading the same fights</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.669" end="00:41:21.959" style="s2">or backstabbing each other or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.439" end="00:41:25.109" style="s2">it is even if it&#39;s value destructive for</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.959" end="00:41:27.769" style="s2">everyone in the firm and the way out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.109" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">that is you recognize that confusion</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.769" end="00:41:32.699" style="s2">understand it drop the assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:34.380" style="s2">reorient to the intentional goal and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.699" end="00:41:36.209" style="s2">then you can start moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.380" end="00:41:39.239" style="s2">clarity then you can start moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.209" end="00:41:40.619" style="s2">towards the clarity of okay I know what</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.239" end="00:41:42.630" style="s2">actually matters here I&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.619" end="00:41:44.609" style="s2">simplified down to something that I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.630" end="00:41:46.619" style="s2">do action taking on not because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.609" end="00:41:50.219" style="s2">retrenched to my existing mental model</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.619" end="00:41:51.749" style="s2">but because I&#39;ve expanded it to take in</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.219" end="00:41:53.989" style="s2">this new information and I&#39;ve adjusted</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.749" end="00:41:56.429" style="s2">appropriately to make sense of it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.989" end="00:41:58.739" style="s2">then it&#39;s just about experimental action</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.429" end="00:42:00.989" style="s2">taking right because clarity I think as</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.739" end="00:42:04.019" style="s2">you said at the beginning it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.989" end="00:42:06.949" style="s2">fixed place right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a constant</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.019" end="00:42:09.209" style="s2">dynamic loop between okay confusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.949" end="00:42:10.709" style="s2">awareness I&#39;m doing my sense making now</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.209" end="00:42:12.689" style="s2">I&#39;m taking action from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.709" end="00:42:15.389" style="s2">clarity okay what did I learn from that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.689" end="00:42:16.430" style="s2">update my hypothesis and now have</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.389" end="00:42:18.590" style="s2">expanded by mental Maude</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.430" end="00:42:21.080" style="s2">again and I&#39;m back to the next step of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.590" end="00:42:22.790" style="s2">the strategy right so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.080" end="00:42:24.230" style="s2">rapidly run that loop where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.790" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">catching your own confusion in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.230" end="00:42:28.670" style="s2">confusion of others reorienting them to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:30.980" style="s2">what actually matters and expanding the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.670" end="00:42:34.340" style="s2">mental model through experimental action</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.980" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s more or less how you win in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.340" end="00:42:39.170" style="s2">game be world we have adopted a model</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:41.630" style="s2">from a fighter pilot named John Boyd</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.170" end="00:42:44.930" style="s2">called the OODA loop observe orient</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.630" end="00:42:48.110" style="s2">decide act and then repeat it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.930" end="00:42:49.970" style="s2">very very similar yeah and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.110" end="00:42:51.380" style="s2">challenge right with the with the OODA</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.230" end="00:42:58.610" style="s2">can get lost in the orient stage in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.240" end="00:42:59.960" style="s2">particular exactly that&#39;s the hard one</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.610" end="00:43:03.830" style="s2">people don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.960" end="00:43:06.830" style="s2">right and it&#39;s hard enough to do as and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.830" end="00:43:08.750" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing it as a collective the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.830" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">complexity of that scales exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.750" end="00:43:12.620" style="s2">right and that&#39;s where you have to start</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:14.840" style="s2">thinking about okay this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.620" end="00:43:17.210" style="s2">about me how am I going to actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.840" end="00:43:18.830" style="s2">orient large groups of people the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.210" end="00:43:20.810" style="s2">majority of whom are going to be</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">you do that so one way that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:31.190" style="s2">listen I think I think it&#39;s an ongoing</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.000" end="00:43:39.940" style="s2">I think there&#39;s always room to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.500" end="00:43:42.320" style="s2">learning and expanding the model but</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.940" end="00:43:44.360" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a couple of key areas</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.320" end="00:43:46.340" style="s2">where especially in an organizational</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.360" end="00:43:50.750" style="s2">context you have to create clarity for</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.340" end="00:43:52.180" style="s2">your people and so those are goals like</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.750" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">what are we actually going for</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.180" end="00:43:56.930" style="s2">leadership which is hey what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.490" style="s2">on the horizon we&#39;re heading towards and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.930" end="00:44:01.160" style="s2">why in the world should you trust me to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.490" end="00:44:02.960" style="s2">get us there management like how does</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.160" end="00:44:05.660" style="s2">this work who&#39;s responsible for what</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:08.450" style="s2">what are the processes etc etc and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.660" end="00:44:10.820" style="s2">finally culture which pretty much just</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.450" end="00:44:13.190" style="s2">boils down to what are the behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.820" end="00:44:16.040" style="s2">that people expect to be rewarded and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.190" end="00:44:18.620" style="s2">punished around here if you give people</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.040" end="00:44:20.420" style="s2">clarity across those areas then it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.620" end="00:44:22.760" style="s2">becomes very easy to run that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.420" end="00:44:24.950" style="s2">orientation process right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.760" end="00:44:26.990" style="s2">someone gets confused you get confused</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.950" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">whatever it is the outcome you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.990" end="00:44:29.550" style="s2">the outcome you want right someone</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:31.560" style="s2">misses miss</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.550" end="00:44:34.020" style="s2">is a key result missus they&#39;re okay are</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.560" end="00:44:36.210" style="s2">whatever it is and rather than it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.020" end="00:44:38.190" style="s2">turning into this sort of blame festival</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.210" end="00:44:39.750" style="s2">or you know we have to throw up our</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.190" end="00:44:41.460" style="s2">hands or we do it or fire someone</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.750" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">whatever it is you actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.460" end="00:44:45.780" style="s2">framework for saying okay let&#39;s step</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">back how is this supposed to work what</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.780" end="00:44:50.130" style="s2">are we trying to achieve does this get</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:51.650" style="s2">us towards that point on the horizon and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.130" end="00:44:55.110" style="s2">is there something that needs to change</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.650" end="00:44:57.450" style="s2">given given how this went down the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.110" end="00:45:00.660" style="s2">challenge right with most orientation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.450" end="00:45:03.510" style="s2">that there&#39;s very poor diagnosis we tend</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.660" end="00:45:04.740" style="s2">to be very bad at actually pinpointing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.510" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">where the problem was</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.740" end="00:45:10.890" style="s2">and the inability to pinpoint the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:13.140" style="s2">problem usually boils down to a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.890" end="00:45:15.210" style="s2">clarity on one of those four elements if</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.140" end="00:45:18.150" style="s2">not more so let&#39;s go back to your</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.210" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">example of the director right so your HR</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.150" end="00:45:21.630" style="s2">director comes through with this drug</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.990" style="s2">test policy for whatever reason thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.630" end="00:45:27.750" style="s2">it was a good idea etcetera etcetera</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.990" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">missed all of these key elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.750" end="00:45:32.370" style="s2">enterprise clarity for the company that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:33.870" style="s2">you are working for right that your goal</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.370" end="00:45:35.790" style="s2">is bottom line that&#39;s all that really</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.870" end="00:45:37.830" style="s2">matters the management structure is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.790" end="00:45:40.440" style="s2">decentralized so doing broad-based</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.830" end="00:45:43.050" style="s2">edicts is not going to work the culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.440" end="00:45:45.330" style="s2">is one in which you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.050" end="00:45:47.880" style="s2">indexing to results rather than people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.330" end="00:45:49.800" style="s2">personal lives so doing behavior that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.880" end="00:45:52.290" style="s2">controlling towards other people is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.800" end="00:45:54.150" style="s2">going to work and then so you look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.290" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">all of that that person was confused</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.150" end="00:45:57.270" style="s2">about all of these key elements around</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:59.670" style="s2">how the your company was actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.270" end="00:46:01.410" style="s2">working and the net result right was</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.670" end="00:46:03.870" style="s2">that they created something that a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.410" end="00:46:06.300" style="s2">pissed you off and B ended up getting</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.870" end="00:46:08.040" style="s2">the CEO having to step in and luckily in</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.300" end="00:46:10.250" style="s2">that particular case your CEO actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.040" end="00:46:12.360" style="s2">had the clarity about those areas</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.250" end="00:46:13.380" style="s2">sufficient to say hey that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.360" end="00:46:15.240" style="s2">things work around here</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.380" end="00:46:17.130" style="s2">which prevented that from cascading</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.240" end="00:46:19.590" style="s2">throughout the org right because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.130" end="00:46:21.210" style="s2">what you see more often than not is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.590" end="00:46:22.680" style="s2">the CEO doesn&#39;t have clarity they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.210" end="00:46:24.510" style="s2">just come in and say something like I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.680" end="00:46:26.070" style="s2">just let Jim have his way this time or</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.510" end="00:46:29.580" style="s2">something like that or you to play nice</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.070" end="00:46:30.990" style="s2">or whatever it is and then you and now</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.580" end="00:46:32.100" style="s2">you&#39;ve sown the seeds of future</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.990" end="00:46:33.690" style="s2">confusion in the org</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.100" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">because now the HR director goes to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.690" end="00:46:37.350" style="s2">their people and says oh we got to work</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:38.910" style="s2">around this Jim and like well</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.350" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">we&#39;ll do drug testing for everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.910" end="00:46:42.490" style="s2">but not Jim&#39;s little boring but we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:44.230" style="s2">trying to work to undermine the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.490" end="00:46:45.850" style="s2">future because they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.230" end="00:46:48.130" style="s2">respect us and whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.850" end="00:46:50.050" style="s2">whatever and that hardens over time</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.130" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">until you end up with these companies</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.050" end="00:46:54.550" style="s2">that are basically divided into warring</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:57.310" style="s2">fiefdom z&#39; where there really doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.550" end="00:46:58.570" style="s2">need to be a war very good point that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.310" end="00:47:00.730" style="s2">because that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.570" end="00:47:02.280" style="s2">you know our CEO because we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.730" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">radically be centralized organization</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.280" end="00:47:08.350" style="s2">didn&#39;t have too many actual duties other</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:10.510" style="s2">than you know to cut off heads when</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.350" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">people failed to perform and to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.510" end="00:47:13.960" style="s2">sure that the culture you know was</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:15.850" style="s2">relatively clearly communicated to</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.960" end="00:47:18.040" style="s2">people and you know when I think back on</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.850" end="00:47:20.470" style="s2">it interestingly this HR guy was brand</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.040" end="00:47:23.230" style="s2">new he&#39;d come in from a much more</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.470" end="00:47:24.610" style="s2">traditionally organized big company when</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.230" end="00:47:26.680" style="s2">I heard through the grapevine he was</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.610" end="00:47:28.210" style="s2">utterly scandalized by the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.680" end="00:47:30.250" style="s2">didn&#39;t already have a corporate drug</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.210" end="00:47:32.530" style="s2">testing policy and just thought how</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.250" end="00:47:35.140" style="s2">could anybody not right and somehow had</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.530" end="00:47:37.360" style="s2">not been properly acculturated in these</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.140" end="00:47:39.730" style="s2">almost religious tenants of the company</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.360" end="00:47:41.290" style="s2">there you go existing mental model for</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.730" end="00:47:43.720" style="s2">how companies work for what matters</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.290" end="00:47:46.119" style="s2">comes in sees it&#39;s not there and is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.720" end="00:47:48.340" style="s2">these people must be nuts so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.119" end="00:47:50.590" style="s2">to take it upon myself to fix this right</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.340" end="00:47:52.810" style="s2">to create something that is in line with</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.590" end="00:47:54.490" style="s2">my existing mental model rather than</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.810" end="00:47:57.010" style="s2">trying to actually understand how this</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.490" end="00:47:59.470" style="s2">place works so how do you get up senior</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.010" end="00:48:00.940" style="s2">management team to get that if they</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.470" end="00:48:02.770" style="s2">aren&#39;t already there again in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.940" end="00:48:05.530" style="s2">company we had the fact that the company</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.770" end="00:48:07.600" style="s2">had a 20-year tradition of radical</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.530" end="00:48:10.600" style="s2">decentralization which was almost</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.600" end="00:48:12.790" style="s2">religious in its intensity most</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.600" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">companies aren&#39;t that way yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.790" end="00:48:18.070" style="s2">think the answer is painstakingly for</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:20.530" style="s2">the most part it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a grind</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.070" end="00:48:22.390" style="s2">you got to run that loop consistently</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.530" end="00:48:25.330" style="s2">right where you&#39;re helping people make</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.390" end="00:48:27.250" style="s2">sense of how often things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.330" end="00:48:28.600" style="s2">matching their expectations which if</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.250" end="00:48:30.190" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a management team</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.600" end="00:48:31.690" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have that clarity around</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.190" end="00:48:33.850" style="s2">those four elements doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.690" end="00:48:34.450" style="s2">enterprise clarity it&#39;s going to be all</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.850" end="00:48:37.930" style="s2">over the place</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.450" end="00:48:39.640" style="s2">right and if you&#39;ve sat through you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.930" end="00:48:40.990" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve sat through many of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.640" end="00:48:42.550" style="s2">these executive meetings that are just</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.990" end="00:48:45.369" style="s2">sort of interminable right you have one</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.550" end="00:48:46.810" style="s2">person say well you know I think it</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.369" end="00:48:48.100" style="s2">should be this way and then someone else</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.810" end="00:48:49.540" style="s2">says well no I think it should be this</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.100" end="00:48:51.250" style="s2">other way and then it just goes around</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.540" end="00:48:54.520" style="s2">the table and suddenly it&#39;s six hours</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.250" end="00:48:56.260" style="s2">and a million dollars later and like</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.520" end="00:48:59.080" style="s2">what do you just do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.260" end="00:49:01.420" style="s2">right because no one actually was able</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.080" end="00:49:04.030" style="s2">to get to the heart of the confucian at</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.420" end="00:49:05.590" style="s2">hand so the first thing that I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.030" end="00:49:07.390" style="s2">trying to look for whether I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.590" end="00:49:11.380" style="s2">coaching role or trying to concurred my</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.390" end="00:49:13.390" style="s2">clients to do is dial in what is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.380" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">root of the confusion you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.390" end="00:49:18.550" style="s2">actually you have to get out of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:20.290" style="s2">process of trying to be an advocate or</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.550" end="00:49:21.580" style="s2">trying to argue for some position</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.290" end="00:49:24.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s sort of that certainty</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.580" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">path and instead start thinking like an</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.040" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">investigator right okay why does this</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:31.930" style="s2">suck why are we all confused why does</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:35.710" style="s2">this feel so bad why are we missing our</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.930" end="00:49:37.990" style="s2">goals okay it&#39;s because X Y Z it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.710" end="00:49:40.530" style="s2">because okay it sounds like tech thinks</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.990" end="00:49:42.700" style="s2">you know the RCR CTO is indexed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.530" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">creating beautiful products no matter</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.700" end="00:49:46.990" style="s2">what and our sales team just wants him</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">to respond to their feature requests</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.990" end="00:49:49.869" style="s2">because they need to sell and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:51.700" style="s2">care about the beauty of the product</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.869" end="00:49:55.390" style="s2">right okay so there&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.700" end="00:49:57.190" style="s2">mismatch there around what you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.390" end="00:49:59.280" style="s2">to create and how you win in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.190" end="00:50:02.140" style="s2">marketplace if you have a good CEO</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.280" end="00:50:04.630" style="s2">they&#39;ll crystallize that as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.140" end="00:50:08.140" style="s2">confusion point and then from there be</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.630" end="00:50:10.359" style="s2">able to clarify okay the way we win in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.140" end="00:50:13.090" style="s2">the market is whatever it is X Y Z and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.359" end="00:50:14.890" style="s2">then see is there a way that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.090" end="00:50:17.619" style="s2">going to be able to hit that it might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.890" end="00:50:19.000" style="s2">such that okay CTO guy I hear you care</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.619" end="00:50:20.650" style="s2">about the beauty but we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.000" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">iterate fast to get there we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.650" end="00:50:24.280" style="s2">learning from the market to inform that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:25.960" style="s2">because our strategy is to whatever move</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.280" end="00:50:28.180" style="s2">fast and deliver to customers no matter</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.960" end="00:50:29.470" style="s2">what so we&#39;re gonna go with the sales</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.180" end="00:50:31.720" style="s2">guys approach but it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.470" end="00:50:33.220" style="s2">feeding back into your product or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.720" end="00:50:35.650" style="s2">it&#39;s going to the sales guy and saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.220" end="00:50:37.210" style="s2">hey listen we have long lead times and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.650" end="00:50:38.260" style="s2">want my Tech&#39;s and we&#39;re gonna win</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.210" end="00:50:40.510" style="s2">because we&#39;re gonna be creating</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.260" end="00:50:43.030" style="s2">something new in this market and I want</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.510" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">my CTO focused on these long term high</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.030" end="00:50:47.830" style="s2">standard build projects so go figure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:49.780" style="s2">how to sell what you have and stop</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.830" end="00:50:52.510" style="s2">arguing about it right you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.780" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">able to step back and rather than diving</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.510" end="00:50:56.830" style="s2">into the content of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:59.350" style="s2">frame the existing confusion point and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.830" end="00:51:01.270" style="s2">then be able to go to clarity about how</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.350" end="00:51:03.580" style="s2">you&#39;re operating and what your actual</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.270" end="00:51:04.150" style="s2">northstar is then you can start moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.580" end="00:51:07.450" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.150" end="00:51:09.970" style="s2">yeah the North Star is really critical</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.450" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">you know again in my own units I had</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.970" end="00:51:14.260" style="s2">similar thing I called it Pikes Peak I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:16.540" style="s2">say let&#39;s imagine we&#39;re 200 miles out on</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.260" end="00:51:19.000" style="s2">the plains of eastern Colorado and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.540" end="00:51:20.560" style="s2">there&#39;s Pikes Peak just see the little</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.000" end="00:51:22.840" style="s2">tip of it way out there on the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.560" end="00:51:24.940" style="s2">we have no idea what River Valley&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.840" end="00:51:26.320" style="s2">hostile Indian tribes with deserts we</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.940" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">have to cross to get there but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.320" end="00:51:28.420" style="s2">heading for Pikes Peak goddammit let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:31.030" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.420" end="00:51:33.070" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s exactly right and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.030" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s a challenge in practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.070" end="00:51:38.020" style="s2">right is what I just described to you it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:40.090" style="s2">requires a fairly high level of mastery</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.020" end="00:51:41.650" style="s2">to actually be able to do that on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.090" end="00:51:43.090" style="s2">fly when you have lots of stuff flying</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.650" end="00:51:47.290" style="s2">at you and you&#39;re often confused</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.090" end="00:51:50.440" style="s2">yourself right so I usually try to break</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.290" end="00:51:55.119" style="s2">this down to some real basic first</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.440" end="00:51:57.700" style="s2">principles which is one just just assume</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:51:59.740" style="s2">that the people around you including</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.700" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">yourself are confused like just hold</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.740" end="00:52:03.550" style="s2">that as an assumption they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:06.040" style="s2">not trying to you they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.550" end="00:52:07.420" style="s2">not evil people they&#39;re not bad stupid</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.040" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">or lazy which is typically the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.420" end="00:52:11.830" style="s2">narratives we go to they are confused</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.000" end="00:52:13.630" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.830" end="00:52:15.490" style="s2">what is happening around them and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.630" end="00:52:17.740" style="s2">seeing reactions because of that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.490" end="00:52:22.180" style="s2">don&#39;t make sense then just start with</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.740" end="00:52:24.250" style="s2">you right go from okay I need to make my</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.180" end="00:52:27.580" style="s2">own narrative to what am I missing here</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.250" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">that basic shift from I need to push my</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.580" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">perspective to what am I missing here</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:35.410" style="s2">save so much heartache it&#39;s unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:37.270" style="s2">like I&#39;ve I&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve seen literally</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.410" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">billions of dollars of company value</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.270" end="00:52:41.770" style="s2">saved because you know two co-founders</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:43.480" style="s2">who were at each other&#39;s necks stepped</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.770" end="00:52:45.220" style="s2">back for a second to ask what am I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.480" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">missing here and saw that they were</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.220" end="00:52:49.960" style="s2">basically on the same page it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:51.820" style="s2">common and then finally just getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.960" end="00:52:53.589" style="s2">into a spirit of investigation like</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.820" end="00:52:55.089" style="s2">let&#39;s go actually figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.589" end="00:52:57.310" style="s2">going on here if I&#39;m assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.089" end="00:52:58.839" style="s2">things aren&#39;t working not because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.310" end="00:53:00.369" style="s2">a bad person or because you&#39;re a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.839" end="00:53:02.530" style="s2">person or because you&#39;re lazy but</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.369" end="00:53:05.670" style="s2">because there&#39;s some confusion here</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.530" end="00:53:08.230" style="s2">either and it probably starts with me</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.670" end="00:53:09.880" style="s2">then let&#39;s go figure out where that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.230" end="00:53:11.250" style="s2">and see if we can get to clarity</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.880" end="00:53:13.380" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.250" end="00:53:15.630" style="s2">yep that makes sense maybe talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.380" end="00:53:18.030" style="s2">bit about let&#39;s say there&#39;s an executive</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.630" end="00:53:19.800" style="s2">senior executive team of what five</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.030" end="00:53:21.240" style="s2">people or usually it&#39;s five people that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.800" end="00:53:23.700" style="s2">really you know hold the culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.240" end="00:53:27.420" style="s2">together or not how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.700" end="00:53:29.460" style="s2">engage them in this process yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.420" end="00:53:30.869" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question I think it&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.460" end="00:53:32.580" style="s2">think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.869" end="00:53:34.320" style="s2">question about how do you institute any</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.580" end="00:53:35.760" style="s2">kind of cultural change right because</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.320" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">well we&#39;re fundamentally talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.760" end="00:53:41.390" style="s2">at that level is culture change it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:43.470" style="s2">saying you will be rewarded for</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.390" end="00:53:45.300" style="s2">admitting that you are confused and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.470" end="00:53:46.830" style="s2">exploring it right because that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.300" end="00:53:48.270" style="s2">the underlying fear that most people</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.830" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">have right they get into these</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.270" end="00:53:53.220" style="s2">situations and there&#39;s often an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:55.770" style="s2">cultural assumption that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.220" end="00:53:57.930" style="s2">zero-sum game right if you win the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.770" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">argument in the in the room then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.930" end="00:54:01.230" style="s2">gonna get more resources more status</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:03.330" style="s2">whatever it is and the loser will have</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.230" end="00:54:05.640" style="s2">to go away so you never want to share</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.330" end="00:54:07.470" style="s2">that you&#39;re uncertain you never want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.640" end="00:54:09.060" style="s2">take responsibility you never want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.470" end="00:54:11.580" style="s2">look for the limits of your own mental</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.060" end="00:54:14.220" style="s2">model because that&#39;s the first step on</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.580" end="00:54:15.930" style="s2">the pathway to defeat right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.220" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">sort of underlying cultural assumption</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.930" end="00:54:20.849" style="s2">that you see a lot of companies so if</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:23.490" style="s2">you&#39;re a CEO and most often I think this</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.849" end="00:54:26.190" style="s2">change has to come from the CEO you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.490" end="00:54:28.980" style="s2">to be crystal clear both in what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.190" end="00:54:32.070" style="s2">communicating and more difficult how</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.980" end="00:54:35.339" style="s2">you&#39;re behaving to reinforce this new</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.070" end="00:54:37.650" style="s2">culture so hey guys we need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.339" end="00:54:39.570" style="s2">fast learning fast is how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.650" end="00:54:41.369" style="s2">win and we can&#39;t learn fast unless we</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.570" end="00:54:45.060" style="s2">actually are clear on where things are</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.369" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">breaking so from now on the behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.060" end="00:54:49.320" style="s2">that are going to get rewarded</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:50.609" style="s2">escalating problems calling for sync</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.320" end="00:54:52.380" style="s2">when you&#39;re confused rather than</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.609" end="00:54:54.180" style="s2">continuing the battle taking</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.380" end="00:54:55.470" style="s2">responsibility for your own confusion</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.180" end="00:54:57.060" style="s2">and the outcomes that are being missed</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.470" end="00:54:58.800" style="s2">those behaviors are going to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.060" end="00:55:00.480" style="s2">rewarded and the behaviors that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.800" end="00:55:02.369" style="s2">going to get rewarded is diving into</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:05.190" style="s2">content without actually setting up a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.369" end="00:55:07.470" style="s2">frame deviating from the big picture and</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.190" end="00:55:09.900" style="s2">going for personal goals at the expense</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.470" end="00:55:11.430" style="s2">of company goals whatever it is you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.900" end="00:55:13.859" style="s2">go through that list and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.430" end="00:55:16.320" style="s2">to actually stick to it right and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.859" end="00:55:17.640" style="s2">takes time like this is the grindy part</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.320" end="00:55:19.619" style="s2">of it right and I think we started</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.640" end="00:55:21.690" style="s2">talking about how difficult it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.619" end="00:55:23.940" style="s2">actually do change just through theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.690" end="00:55:24.900" style="s2">you have to actually be they&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.940" end="00:55:27.780" style="s2">balls and strikes</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.900" end="00:55:29.610" style="s2">in the meeting and say hey that thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.780" end="00:55:32.660" style="s2">that was awesome I&#39;m so glad you brought</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.610" end="00:55:36.060" style="s2">up that confusion point okay great and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.660" end="00:55:38.610" style="s2">versus hey are you actually tracking the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.060" end="00:55:40.200" style="s2">goal here let&#39;s step back remember rules</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.610" end="00:55:42.450" style="s2">of the game is this we take</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.200" end="00:55:44.130" style="s2">responsibility we escalate problems we</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.450" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">start with our own confusion and get</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.130" end="00:55:48.630" style="s2">investigative about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:50.280" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing that right now and if</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.630" end="00:55:51.690" style="s2">you keep not doing that you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.280" end="00:55:54.660" style="s2">not going to be an executive here for</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.690" end="00:55:56.340" style="s2">very long yep that would certainly help</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.660" end="00:55:58.410" style="s2">that would certainly help you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.340" end="00:56:00.120" style="s2">interesting in my own companies I had</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.410" end="00:56:02.070" style="s2">something that was kind of a conflation</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.120" end="00:56:05.010" style="s2">of your three points now I think about</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.070" end="00:56:07.890" style="s2">which I always called our basic cultural</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.010" end="00:56:10.080" style="s2">premise is intellectual honesty in all</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.890" end="00:56:12.990" style="s2">things right you know you always</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.080" end="00:56:13.560" style="s2">escalate bad news you never shoot the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.990" end="00:56:15.810" style="s2">messenger</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.560" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">you&#39;ll give credit to whoever it is I</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.810" end="00:56:19.140" style="s2">would always say if the receptionist</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:21.510" style="s2">comes up with the 100 million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.140" end="00:56:24.660" style="s2">product she gets the credit for it</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.510" end="00:56:27.720" style="s2">etc in some sense intellectual honesty</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.660" end="00:56:31.290" style="s2">above all else is kind of infused in all</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.720" end="00:56:34.860" style="s2">three of your components yeah and and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.290" end="00:56:37.110" style="s2">want to just to at risk of complicating</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.860" end="00:56:39.570" style="s2">the picture well I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.110" end="00:56:42.900" style="s2">critical for actually moving towards a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.570" end="00:56:44.760" style="s2">learning organization you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.900" end="00:56:46.950" style="s2">run a successful organization that</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.760" end="00:56:48.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have those qualities as long as</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.950" end="00:56:51.060" style="s2">you&#39;re actually providing clarity for</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.600" end="00:56:52.800" style="s2">people about how things work and being</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.060" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">clear about when it deviates from that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.800" end="00:56:57.570" style="s2">so one example that I love is Spirit</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:59.460" style="s2">Airlines right you know everyone makes</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.570" end="00:57:00.840" style="s2">jokes about how they suck so much and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.460" end="00:57:02.580" style="s2">how the experience is terrible and how</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.840" end="00:57:04.440" style="s2">you&#39;d never fly them again and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.580" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">one of the most successful airlines ever</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.440" end="00:57:11.070" style="s2">and the CEO Bal Danzo was just</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:12.930" style="s2">relentlessly clear with people that he</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.070" end="00:57:14.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t give a about anyone he</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.930" end="00:57:15.630" style="s2">didn&#39;t give a about employees he</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.190" end="00:57:18.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t give a about customers all</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.630" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">you had to do all the time was make</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.300" end="00:57:21.870" style="s2">cheaper and figure out how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:23.790" style="s2">squeeze money out of people that was it</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.870" end="00:57:26.190" style="s2">that&#39;s all he cared about who delivered</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.790" end="00:57:28.830" style="s2">that one and who didn&#39;t lost and under</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.190" end="00:57:31.050" style="s2">that leadership spirit actually became</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.830" end="00:57:32.760" style="s2">remarkably successful and actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.050" end="00:57:34.980" style="s2">pushed the needle on a number of things</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.760" end="00:57:37.310" style="s2">that you&#39;re seeing today driving down</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.980" end="00:57:39.080" style="s2">air fares across the board etc</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.310" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">now I like using that example because</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.080" end="00:57:42.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not the warm fuzzy one the warm</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:45.410" style="s2">fuzzy one is you know Herb Kelleher at</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.980" end="00:57:47.330" style="s2">Southwest who had clarity on the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.410" end="00:57:48.680" style="s2">side right like we do everything with</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.330" end="00:57:50.780" style="s2">love it&#39;s all about the customer</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.680" end="00:57:53.210" style="s2">experience we treat each other well</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.780" end="00:57:55.400" style="s2">these are the rules of the game two very</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.210" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">different companies operating under very</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.400" end="00:58:00.140" style="s2">different cultural rule sets both</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:02.450" style="s2">successful because they led with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.140" end="00:58:04.040" style="s2">clarity people were basically able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.450" end="00:58:06.140" style="s2">make sense of what was going on around</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.040" end="00:58:08.270" style="s2">them we&#39;re a social species we always</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.140" end="00:58:11.840" style="s2">want to know how we&#39;re supposed to work</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.270" end="00:58:14.030" style="s2">with the group and that clarity enabled</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.840" end="00:58:16.420" style="s2">two diametrically opposed businesses in</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.030" end="00:58:19.220" style="s2">the same industry to succeed right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.420" end="00:58:21.500" style="s2">the the interesting sort of code on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.220" end="00:58:23.660" style="s2">Spirit Airlines example is that ball</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.500" end="00:58:26.570" style="s2">Danza actually ended up handing off the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.660" end="00:58:29.330" style="s2">reins to this other guy for Niro in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.570" end="00:58:31.070" style="s2">because they were so successful that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.330" end="00:58:32.450" style="s2">they were like actually we need to stop</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.070" end="00:58:34.250" style="s2">treating the customers like on</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.450" end="00:58:36.020" style="s2">things like on time and things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.250" end="00:58:37.190" style="s2">actually people care about and ball</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.020" end="00:58:39.110" style="s2">dance was like you know what I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.190" end="00:58:41.480" style="s2">wrong guy for this because I truly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.110" end="00:58:43.310" style="s2">give a so I&#39;m gonna hand the reins</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.480" end="00:58:45.770" style="s2">over to someone who I love that I love</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.310" end="00:58:48.800" style="s2">that story and that and to me that is an</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.770" end="00:58:50.630" style="s2">example of leadership clarity right you</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.800" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">set clear guidelines you set clear</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.630" end="00:58:54.290" style="s2">cultural rules you set a clear North</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:56.330" style="s2">Star and how you&#39;re gonna win such that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.290" end="00:58:58.040" style="s2">people understand it you&#39;re ruthless in</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.330" end="00:59:01.190" style="s2">how you&#39;re driving it through the org</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.040" end="00:59:04.310" style="s2">but then you actually have the humility</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.190" end="00:59:06.380" style="s2">or the self skepticism to recognize when</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.310" end="00:59:09.110" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost the thread when the macro</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.380" end="00:59:10.910" style="s2">game demands something else and in that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.110" end="00:59:12.410" style="s2">case sometimes the best thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.910" end="00:59:14.840" style="s2">step down and find someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.410" end="00:59:16.430" style="s2">actually better suited to that role that</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.840" end="00:59:17.570" style="s2">I love that I love that story I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.430" end="00:59:19.460" style="s2">know I never even heard of Spirit</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.570" end="00:59:21.980" style="s2">Airlines tell you the truth I do know</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.460" end="00:59:24.560" style="s2">Southwest very well actually was friends</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.980" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">with Roland Kings son who Roland King</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.560" end="00:59:27.920" style="s2">was one of the two co-founders and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:30.080" style="s2">know it&#39;s a company I have admired</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.920" end="00:59:32.150" style="s2">greatly but I didn&#39;t realize there was</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.080" end="00:59:34.190" style="s2">essentially an anti Southwest out there</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.150" end="00:59:35.360" style="s2">in the same marketplace off the have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.190" end="00:59:37.370" style="s2">look into that a little bit because it</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.360" end="00:59:39.560" style="s2">sounds like an interesting story and it</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.370" end="00:59:42.080" style="s2">certainly does highlight the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.560" end="00:59:44.750" style="s2">clarity above all else whether it&#39;s dark</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.080" end="00:59:47.690" style="s2">clarity or light clarity both can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.750" end="00:59:49.400" style="s2">effective I suppose totally I mean look</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.690" end="00:59:50.260" style="s2">at you know you can look in and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.400" end="00:59:51.970" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.260" end="00:59:54.820" style="s2">more examples of that right you have you</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.970" end="00:59:56.620" style="s2">have Nike like backstabbing competitive</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.820" end="00:59:58.840" style="s2">culture starting from what Phil Knight</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.620" end="01:00:00.310" style="s2">is like and it worked because people</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.840" end="01:00:03.340" style="s2">understood that&#39;s the game we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.310" end="01:00:05.260" style="s2">here yeah child&#39;s a child slave labor</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.340" end="01:00:08.200" style="s2">what the whatever it takes right</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.260" end="01:00:10.930" style="s2">now and and so and I use these examples</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.200" end="01:00:13.390" style="s2">right because the clarity enables the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.930" end="01:00:14.830" style="s2">winning now if you want to actually win</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.390" end="01:00:16.390" style="s2">with a higher that with the different</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.830" end="01:00:17.830" style="s2">values that go into you know game B</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.390" end="01:00:19.270" style="s2">values or something because you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.830" end="01:00:21.790" style="s2">these aren&#39;t the kinds of companies I</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.270" end="01:00:23.800" style="s2">would want to work for the what gets</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.790" end="01:00:25.840" style="s2">lost right when people try to put these</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.800" end="01:00:27.640" style="s2">things into practice is that clarity</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.840" end="01:00:29.170" style="s2">about who we are what we stand for and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.640" end="01:00:31.420" style="s2">how it works and a willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.170" end="01:00:33.850" style="s2">actually drive that down through the org</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.420" end="01:00:35.740" style="s2">and everything that gets done ok Jake</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.850" end="01:00:38.380" style="s2">this has been very interesting and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.740" end="01:00:41.470" style="s2">think speaks very clearly to how to do a</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.290" end="01:01:04.660" style="s2">use game B as an example our four</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.540" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">pillars of game B are that the things</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.660" end="01:01:09.900" style="s2">that emerge in game B will be</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:13.570" style="s2">self-organizing network centric</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.900" end="01:01:14.950" style="s2">decentralized and metastable the first</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.570" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">three are probably sort of obvious</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.950" end="01:01:19.750" style="s2">metastable means that they can last a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:21.700" style="s2">long time but probably without by not</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.750" end="01:01:23.860" style="s2">staying the same they have to constantly</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.700" end="01:01:26.560" style="s2">flex and change and adapt to their</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.860" end="01:01:27.970" style="s2">co-evolutionary landscape to last for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.560" end="01:01:30.310" style="s2">long time but they should be built with</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.970" end="01:01:32.890" style="s2">that in mind to be able to do just that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.310" end="01:01:34.900" style="s2">rather different context then let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.890" end="01:01:37.660" style="s2">the company I talked about where we</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.900" end="01:01:39.340" style="s2">happen to have you know a CEO who when</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.660" end="01:01:41.230" style="s2">he needed to could throw lightning bolts</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.340" end="01:01:44.440" style="s2">and wood to defend the culture as</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.230" end="01:01:45.220" style="s2">opposed to true self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.440" end="01:01:47.470" style="s2">bottoms-up</p>

<p begin="01:01:47.470" end="01:01:51.760" style="s2">do you think applies to game B and where</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.110" end="01:01:54.500" style="s2">might it need to be extended feel free</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.760" end="01:01:57.859" style="s2">to go long on this answer by the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.500" end="01:01:59.900" style="s2">yeah absolutely so I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.859" end="01:02:01.940" style="s2">great question and part of the reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.900" end="01:02:03.500" style="s2">right why orient to the desert of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.940" end="01:02:05.420" style="s2">hierarchy structure is just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.500" end="01:02:07.700" style="s2">what&#39;s most common out in the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.420" end="01:02:10.430" style="s2">right now but the reality is that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.700" end="01:02:12.380" style="s2">that hierarchical structure is just a</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.430" end="01:02:15.410" style="s2">one particular clustering of</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.380" end="01:02:18.440" style="s2">responsibilities right where I think a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.410" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">lot of people get lost when playing the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.440" end="01:02:23.810" style="s2">decentralization game is that they say</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:26.180" style="s2">oh well okay if these responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.810" end="01:02:28.339" style="s2">lived in the CEO or lived in a manager</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.180" end="01:02:30.410" style="s2">or whatever it is we&#39;ll just get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.339" end="01:02:33.619" style="s2">all of that right and we&#39;ll just all go</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.410" end="01:02:35.750" style="s2">do a thing together and in most cases</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.619" end="01:02:37.310" style="s2">that just devolves pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.750" end="01:02:40.010" style="s2">particularly if there&#39;s any shock to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.310" end="01:02:42.530" style="s2">system so the first thing I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.010" end="01:02:46.099" style="s2">recognizing that the responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.530" end="01:02:48.290" style="s2">related to creating clarity those exist</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.099" end="01:02:50.089" style="s2">no matter what structure you&#39;re in you</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.290" end="01:02:51.800" style="s2">still need clarity across those four</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.089" end="01:02:53.450" style="s2">areas you still need goal clarity you</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.800" end="01:02:54.890" style="s2">still need management clarity you still</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.450" end="01:02:58.490" style="s2">need vision clarity you still need</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.890" end="01:03:00.680" style="s2">culture clarity the responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.490" end="01:03:02.599" style="s2">involved in management meaning helping</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.680" end="01:03:04.190" style="s2">people productively make sense of when</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.599" end="01:03:05.660" style="s2">things aren&#39;t working so that they can</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.190" end="01:03:07.579" style="s2">keep growing and learn how to best</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.660" end="01:03:09.710" style="s2">deploy their talents that is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.579" end="01:03:12.260" style="s2">responsibility that still needs to exist</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.710" end="01:03:14.650" style="s2">it might just not be bundled with say</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.260" end="01:03:17.540" style="s2">you know hire fire authority or</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.650" end="01:03:19.670" style="s2">particular particular reporting lines or</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.540" end="01:03:22.220" style="s2">whatever it is right so what you need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.670" end="01:03:23.780" style="s2">make sure that you have is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.220" end="01:03:26.390" style="s2">trying to create a decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.780" end="01:03:29.240" style="s2">organization that you&#39;re not falling</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.390" end="01:03:31.970" style="s2">into the naive trap of because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.240" end="01:03:34.339" style="s2">like these roles I&#39;m going to just get</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.970" end="01:03:36.349" style="s2">rid of them and the functions that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.339" end="01:03:38.450" style="s2">embedded with it you actually have to</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.349" end="01:03:40.099" style="s2">still solve for those underlying</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.450" end="01:03:42.410" style="s2">functions and there&#39;s lots of different</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.099" end="01:03:45.349" style="s2">ways you could do it right now I will</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.410" end="01:03:46.550" style="s2">say that from and you know you please</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.349" end="01:03:49.790" style="s2">feel free to weigh in on your own</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.550" end="01:03:51.440" style="s2">research here from the cooperative&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.790" end="01:03:53.990" style="s2">decentralized entities and things that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.440" end="01:03:56.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen be successful a lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.990" end="01:03:58.579" style="s2">did start with a founder who kind of set</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.630" end="01:04:00.890" style="s2">that meta container for people to play</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.579" end="01:04:02.390" style="s2">in right so I think about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.890" end="01:04:04.339" style="s2">Morningstar company you know the famous</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.390" end="01:04:06.050" style="s2">or tomato company out California that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.339" end="01:04:07.550" style="s2">highly decentralized I think about</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.050" end="01:04:09.470" style="s2">Mondragon</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.550" end="01:04:12.800" style="s2">a lot of these sort of cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.470" end="01:04:14.690" style="s2">entities started with a founder who laid</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.800" end="01:04:16.579" style="s2">a lot of this stuff out clearly things</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.690" end="01:04:18.140" style="s2">will work in this decentralized way and</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.579" end="01:04:19.760" style="s2">that means that you will have this</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.140" end="01:04:21.380" style="s2">autonomy in this way and you can go do</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.760" end="01:04:22.700" style="s2">this and you can&#39;t do this and if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.380" end="01:04:24.800" style="s2">want to try to create a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.700" end="01:04:26.660" style="s2">fiefdom that&#39;s not gonna fly here they</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.800" end="01:04:28.970" style="s2">were still providing clarity around the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.660" end="01:04:30.380" style="s2">basic rules of the game that others</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.970" end="01:04:31.849" style="s2">could play with and then they stepped</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.380" end="01:04:34.190" style="s2">out of the way right they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.849" end="01:04:36.800" style="s2">maintain sort of the operational veto</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.190" end="01:04:39.320" style="s2">power that&#39;s embedded in the CEO role of</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.800" end="01:04:41.690" style="s2">traditional companies so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.320" end="01:04:43.700" style="s2">my first one right is like one you got</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.690" end="01:04:46.730" style="s2">to recognize that these responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.700" end="01:04:48.260" style="s2">for creating clarity still exist when</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.730" end="01:04:50.150" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to coordinate large groups</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.260" end="01:04:51.470" style="s2">of people whether you want to do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.150" end="01:04:53.720" style="s2">way that&#39;s unbundling those</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.470" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">responsibilities or not does that make</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.720" end="01:04:58.220" style="s2">sense absolutely and and again</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">especially with our game be perspective</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.220" end="01:05:02.329" style="s2">that we have to be disciplined about how</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.079" end="01:05:04.700" style="s2">we do this because our goal our North</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.329" end="01:05:06.500" style="s2">Star is particularly safe for a game be</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:09.200" style="s2">venture we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.500" end="01:05:11.390" style="s2">out-compete game a alternatives so that</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.200" end="01:05:13.760" style="s2">means we can&#39;t be lacks and sloppy and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.390" end="01:05:14.930" style="s2">hippies in a mud hut right though we</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.760" end="01:05:16.579" style="s2">have to figure out how to do this</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.930" end="01:05:18.859" style="s2">without a command and control hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.579" end="01:05:21.170" style="s2">so we have a very difficult problem to</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.859" end="01:05:22.670" style="s2">solve and I would say having looked at</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.170" end="01:05:25.430" style="s2">some of the alternatives like holacracy</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.670" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">etc I&#39;m not convinced anybody actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.430" end="01:05:31.430" style="s2">has a template yet that I would feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:32.900" style="s2">comfortable rolling out at scale and in</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.430" end="01:05:35.089" style="s2">fact templates interesting is another</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.900" end="01:05:38.030" style="s2">one of our key game B concepts we call X</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.089" end="01:05:39.859" style="s2">in a box where X can be anything and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.030" end="01:05:43.220" style="s2">idea is and you know maybe instead of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.859" end="01:05:45.290" style="s2">the founder being the one who lays out</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.220" end="01:05:47.750" style="s2">the deep doctrine the Moses who brings</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.290" end="01:05:49.640" style="s2">down the Ten Commandments some previous</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.750" end="01:05:51.500" style="s2">ventures that more or less found the</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.640" end="01:05:53.810" style="s2">right way to do it documented how they</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.500" end="01:05:56.300" style="s2">did it and created a template we call X</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.810" end="01:05:58.550" style="s2">in a box then any group can take that X</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.300" end="01:06:00.770" style="s2">and think of it as like Kraft macaroni</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.550" end="01:06:03.200" style="s2">and cheese right pretty crappy by itself</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.770" end="01:06:04.730" style="s2">but if you doctor it up and change it to</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.200" end="01:06:06.560" style="s2">your local conditions oh I like green</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.730" end="01:06:08.210" style="s2">chili in my mac and cheese and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.560" end="01:06:08.510" style="s2">pour some heavy cream in there goddamn</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.210" end="01:06:09.890" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.510" end="01:06:11.690" style="s2">you can make it pretty good so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.890" end="01:06:14.240" style="s2">the concept of an X in the box it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.690" end="01:06:16.670" style="s2">to be thought of as a rigid template but</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.240" end="01:06:18.920" style="s2">as a starting place for each team to</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.670" end="01:06:20.740" style="s2">then take and you know add their own</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.920" end="01:06:22.510" style="s2">local ingredients and things</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.740" end="01:06:25.060" style="s2">themselves then go with it and then oh</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.510" end="01:06:27.670" style="s2">by the way it&#39;s their duty if successful</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.060" end="01:06:29.980" style="s2">to report back to the X in the box that</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.670" end="01:06:32.200" style="s2">this fork or we added heavy cream in</p>

<p begin="01:06:41.380" end="01:06:46.090" style="s2">to address at least in part you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.450" end="01:06:48.760" style="s2">your assertion that one somebody&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.090" end="01:06:51.700" style="s2">to do this and two maybe it has to be a</p>

<p begin="01:06:51.700" end="01:06:56.080" style="s2">that strong founder steps away I&#39;d argue</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.890" end="01:06:58.210" style="s2">maybe there had to be such a strong</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.080" end="01:07:00.490" style="s2">founder somewhere up the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.210" end="01:07:02.830" style="s2">chain but through the use of X in the</p>

<p begin="01:07:02.830" end="01:07:07.720" style="s2">and grow and learn these values can be</p>

<p begin="01:07:11.410" end="01:07:16.390" style="s2">yeah listen I I love the X in a box</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.440" end="01:07:17.890" style="s2">concept that was was one of the big</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.390" end="01:07:19.600" style="s2">projects I was working on actually my</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.890" end="01:07:21.369" style="s2">slow money days was sort of check the</p>

<p begin="01:07:25.390" end="01:07:29.830" style="s2">that notion of template izing I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.130" end="01:07:31.810" style="s2">but providing autonomy with with some</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.830" end="01:07:34.030" style="s2">amount of local modification that makes</p>

<p begin="01:07:36.130" end="01:07:40.420" style="s2">founders to set the container I would</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.890" end="01:07:42.190" style="s2">sort of love to believe that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.420" end="01:07:46.270" style="s2">possible I&#39;m not convinced that it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.190" end="01:07:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s mostly where I come out on</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.270" end="01:07:50.320" style="s2">it just because of how hard it is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.400" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">actually get groups of people to agree</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.320" end="01:07:56.020" style="s2">on anything particularly people who are</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:07:58.240" style="s2">interested in decentralization right one</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.020" end="01:08:00.220" style="s2">of the one of the big common failure</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.240" end="01:08:01.900" style="s2">points I saw in sort of a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.220" end="01:08:04.060" style="s2">eco village models and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.900" end="01:08:07.090" style="s2">is that when you when you get a group of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.060" end="01:08:09.190" style="s2">people together who are basically united</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.090" end="01:08:11.740" style="s2">by a distaste for authority and an</p>

<p begin="01:08:14.950" end="01:08:18.009" style="s2">put them all together in a place far</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.480" end="01:08:19.720" style="s2">away from everyone else and surprise</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.009" end="01:08:22.210" style="s2">half the time they tear it themselves</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.720" end="01:08:24.040" style="s2">apart right or more than half because</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.210" end="01:08:25.420" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually no one&#39;s actually</p>

<p begin="01:08:25.420" end="01:08:29.589" style="s2">values and you end up just getting</p>

<p begin="01:08:34.480" end="01:08:39.160" style="s2">that would be my big watch out for</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.609" end="01:08:41.680" style="s2">something like that that you know if</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.160" end="01:08:43.390" style="s2">that&#39;s going to work hey I do think at</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.680" end="01:08:45.310" style="s2">minimum you&#39;re going to need some group</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.390" end="01:08:47.859" style="s2">of people you know if it&#39;s a committee</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.310" end="01:08:50.259" style="s2">or whatever it is who are highly aligned</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.859" end="01:08:52.480" style="s2">who have done the work to get that</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.259" end="01:08:53.230" style="s2">alignment with one another you know and</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.480" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">then you can play with different</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.230" end="01:08:57.130" style="s2">mechanisms I mean this is I&#39;m in no way</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:08:59.470" style="s2">an expert on this but you know some of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.130" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">the things that I have my eye on are you</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.470" end="01:09:04.299" style="s2">know automatically executable contracts</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:06.489" style="s2">in the crypto space you know the whole</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.299" end="01:09:08.200" style="s2">sort of Dow stack approach where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.489" end="01:09:11.620" style="s2">embedding a lot of these protocols into</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.200" end="01:09:14.290" style="s2">code you know and taking the person out</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.620" end="01:09:16.420" style="s2">of it I like I kind of hope some of</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.290" end="01:09:20.529" style="s2">those things work I haven&#39;t yet like you</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.420" end="01:09:23.380" style="s2">I haven&#39;t yet seen anything that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.529" end="01:09:25.750" style="s2">believe is like ready for primetime but</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.380" end="01:09:27.850" style="s2">I&#39;d love to be proven wrong yeah I had</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.750" end="01:09:30.970" style="s2">rich Bartlett on recently and he has a</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.850" end="01:09:33.339" style="s2">whole bunch of interesting ideas you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.970" end="01:09:36.009" style="s2">check him out on medium though his tool</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.339" end="01:09:38.020" style="s2">kit basically takes you up to 10 or 20</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.009" end="01:09:39.940" style="s2">people and it&#39;s quite compelling as a</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.020" end="01:09:41.440" style="s2">way for a group to self-organize and</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.940" end="01:09:43.810" style="s2">start building its values and building</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:45.430" style="s2">its processes but he&#39;s the first to</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.810" end="01:09:47.589" style="s2">admit he has no clue if it&#39;s scales</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.430" end="01:09:48.910" style="s2">beyond that and to do a lot of the kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.589" end="01:09:50.950" style="s2">of things that I&#39;m interested in and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.910" end="01:09:53.259" style="s2">presume you are as well we have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.950" end="01:09:55.360" style="s2">figure out you know how to scale that to</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.259" end="01:09:57.340" style="s2">hundreds thousands tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.360" end="01:09:59.739" style="s2">people working in some form of a cloud</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.340" end="01:10:02.230" style="s2">of decentralized activity that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.739" end="01:10:03.989" style="s2">nonetheless coherent and can out-compete</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.230" end="01:10:08.470" style="s2">game a on its home turf</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.989" end="01:10:11.290" style="s2">yeah and no I totally agree and to me</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.470" end="01:10:13.720" style="s2">and obviously I&#39;m biased given given my</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.290" end="01:10:15.940" style="s2">day-to-day work but I do believe that a</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.720" end="01:10:19.510" style="s2">key missing ingredient is this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.940" end="01:10:21.220" style="s2">confusion and using leveraging confusion</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.510" end="01:10:23.890" style="s2">to create ongoing clarity of learning</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.220" end="01:10:27.760" style="s2">for people that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.890" end="01:10:29.440" style="s2">I most often see missing is there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.760" end="01:10:30.340" style="s2">of this notion right that like well if</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.440" end="01:10:33.340" style="s2">you get a bunch of people together</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.340" end="01:10:35.140" style="s2">basically agree on stuff and hold the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.340" end="01:10:38.650" style="s2">same values etc that it&#39;s all gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.140" end="01:10:41.739" style="s2">out and the reality is that it can work</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.650" end="01:10:44.230" style="s2">out for a bit but inevitably there will</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.739" end="01:10:45.790" style="s2">be confusion people will not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.230" end="01:10:48.310" style="s2">make sense of what is happening with one</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.790" end="01:10:51.270" style="s2">another and in that case they will</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.310" end="01:10:54.550" style="s2">to their worst selves or at least to a</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.270" end="01:10:56.320" style="s2">non-optimal version of themselves so you</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.550" end="01:10:58.090" style="s2">know you see a lot of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.320" end="01:10:59.920" style="s2">enterprises a lot of these projects</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.090" end="01:11:02.050" style="s2">starting with the underlying assumption</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.920" end="01:11:03.460" style="s2">that hey you know we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.050" end="01:11:04.840" style="s2">sovereignty we&#39;ve got these psycho</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.460" end="01:11:07.180" style="s2">technologies we&#39;re all going to be able</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.840" end="01:11:07.840" style="s2">to just be self-regulating and great</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.180" end="01:11:11.320" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.840" end="01:11:14.020" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t account for the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.320" end="01:11:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s just not what our cognition is</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.020" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">wired for we need ongoing sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.440" end="01:11:21.580" style="s2">from those around us to get our heads</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:23.350" style="s2">out of our own asses that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.580" end="01:11:26.500" style="s2">underlying reality of how our brains are</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.350" end="01:11:28.510" style="s2">structured so when I think about what is</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.500" end="01:11:31.660" style="s2">it gonna take you know the seed</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.510" end="01:11:33.910" style="s2">algorithm to me is okay what is the</p>

<p begin="01:12:41.650" end="01:12:48.070" style="s2">member of the team who is confused reach</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.620" end="01:12:50.140" style="s2">clarity or for the wider group to</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.070" end="01:12:52.090" style="s2">realize that this is a high level</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.140" end="01:12:53.950" style="s2">confusion that&#39;s beyond their abilities</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.090" end="01:12:57.340" style="s2">saw and then they would collectively</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.950" end="01:13:00.370" style="s2">escalate it to a wider group to solve</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.340" end="01:13:01.550" style="s2">until some level reduce the confusion to</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.370" end="01:13:03.290" style="s2">clarity</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.550" end="01:13:05.450" style="s2">that process would be reduced to a</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.290" end="01:13:07.310" style="s2">one-page description of what was the</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.450" end="01:13:09.170" style="s2">initial confusion what is the new</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.310" end="01:13:11.000" style="s2">clarity and then that would be published</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.170" end="01:13:13.910" style="s2">to everybody and go into a knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.000" end="01:13:17.270" style="s2">repository for future confusions to use</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.910" end="01:13:20.690" style="s2">the starting raw material I love it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.270" end="01:13:24.920" style="s2">absolutely I think I mean what you what</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.690" end="01:13:28.160" style="s2">you just described is kind of the social</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.920" end="01:13:29.660" style="s2">software that ends up getting that I end</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.160" end="01:13:32.210" style="s2">up helping install for a lot of my</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.660" end="01:13:34.250" style="s2">clients right it&#39;s getting people</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.210" end="01:13:35.090" style="s2">getting people to raise their hand say</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.250" end="01:13:37.430" style="s2">I&#39;m confused</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.090" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">reward it make sure that they get the</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.430" end="01:13:41.030" style="s2">appropriate sense making from someone</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:42.950" style="s2">who can actually help them and then make</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.030" end="01:13:45.890" style="s2">sure that those learnings are reiterated</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.950" end="01:13:47.960" style="s2">back into the wider org that&#39;s it do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.890" end="01:13:49.940" style="s2">have soft worth not yet so I think what</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.960" end="01:13:52.670" style="s2">your what you&#39;re describing turning that</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.940" end="01:13:54.830" style="s2">turning that algorithmic process from</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.670" end="01:13:56.530" style="s2">human software into actual software I</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.830" end="01:13:58.910" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of promise there so</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.530" end="01:14:01.580" style="s2">definitely definitely a project worth</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.910" end="01:14:03.680" style="s2">pursuing and you know in the meantime to</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.580" end="01:14:06.860" style="s2">not let the perfect be the enemy of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.680" end="01:14:09.140" style="s2">good recognizing that that&#39;s a at least</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.860" end="01:14:11.510" style="s2">a sort of a psycho technology that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.140" end="01:14:13.430" style="s2">can install right now so you could</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.510" end="01:14:15.110" style="s2">essentially do it on paper you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.430" end="01:14:16.850" style="s2">sensei I&#39;m confused I&#39;m going to send an</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.110" end="01:14:19.300" style="s2">email out to a group of people to help</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.850" end="01:14:21.110" style="s2">me become unconfused something like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.300" end="01:14:23.690" style="s2">totally yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.110" end="01:14:25.430" style="s2">sounds great yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.690" end="01:14:26.810" style="s2">interesting interesting now I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.430" end="01:14:28.760" style="s2">also go back to something I mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.810" end="01:14:30.230" style="s2">earlier I suspect this will be</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.760" end="01:14:31.820" style="s2">controversial with some of the game be</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.230" end="01:14:34.520" style="s2">folks but I raised this from time to</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.820" end="01:14:37.240" style="s2">time this idea that there are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.520" end="01:14:39.800" style="s2">natural leaders which I call l1 l2 l3</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.240" end="01:14:42.440" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s a gross reification it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.800" end="01:14:44.840" style="s2">clearly a continuum of whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.440" end="01:14:47.300" style="s2">that constitutes this underlying ability</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.840" end="01:14:49.400" style="s2">to be a leader one of the areas that</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.300" end="01:14:51.790" style="s2">particularly Jordan Hall and I have been</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.400" end="01:14:55.630" style="s2">talking about a lot in the background is</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.790" end="01:14:59.330" style="s2">how does a natural l1 through elder</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.630" end="01:15:01.790" style="s2">develop into a true game be leader right</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.330" end="01:15:03.730" style="s2">and what is Game be leadership we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.790" end="01:15:06.140" style="s2">even sure you know I confess I confess</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.730" end="01:15:08.570" style="s2">several times on this podcast and as</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.140" end="01:15:11.180" style="s2">guest on other podcasts but I doubt I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.570" end="01:15:13.100" style="s2">ever be a true game B leader I&#39;m too</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.180" end="01:15:14.540" style="s2">much of a game a right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.100" end="01:15:17.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a groove too heavily</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.540" end="01:15:20.210" style="s2">my brain I can move towards game B ship</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.690" end="01:15:23.120" style="s2">I can coach people in you know how to</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.210" end="01:15:25.580" style="s2">build game B entities that aren&#39;t insane</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.120" end="01:15:28.820" style="s2">when it comes to out competing game a</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.580" end="01:15:31.700" style="s2">but I doubt I&#39;ll ever be a true game B</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.820" end="01:15:34.130" style="s2">leader and I we wonder if you could</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.700" end="01:15:38.930" style="s2">speculate a little bit about what game B</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.130" end="01:15:42.710" style="s2">leadership might even be mmm yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.930" end="01:15:44.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a wonderful question I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.710" end="01:15:45.950" style="s2">got kind of a double-barreled answer for</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.420" end="01:15:48.380" style="s2">you so I&#39;m gonna give you two parts here</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.950" end="01:15:52.360" style="s2">the first is that I would be very</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.380" end="01:15:55.720" style="s2">cautious about sort of single-factor</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.360" end="01:15:58.730" style="s2">one-size-fits-all leadership structures</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.720" end="01:16:00.620" style="s2">what I have seen time and time again is</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.730" end="01:16:02.660" style="s2">that there are different leaders that</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.620" end="01:16:05.960" style="s2">you need for different contexts that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.660" end="01:16:07.790" style="s2">there are contexts where you want a very</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.960" end="01:16:10.400" style="s2">strong leader who&#39;s gonna go around and</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.790" end="01:16:12.020" style="s2">you know yell and push and push people</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.400" end="01:16:13.700" style="s2">to do stuff they&#39;re leading their</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.020" end="01:16:15.380" style="s2">organizations that need a much more</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.700" end="01:16:17.030" style="s2">sensitive touch someone who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.380" end="01:16:18.680" style="s2">be more of a facilitator and bring</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.030" end="01:16:22.310" style="s2">people together and bring the best out</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.680" end="01:16:24.350" style="s2">of them consistently this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.310" end="01:16:27.080" style="s2">there&#39;s only one way to be an effective</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.350" end="01:16:29.900" style="s2">leader irrespective of context I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.080" end="01:16:33.830" style="s2">sinkhole autoships so I would just throw</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.900" end="01:16:35.390" style="s2">that out there as a caveat now too to</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.830" end="01:16:37.430" style="s2">simultaneously undermine what I was</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.390" end="01:16:40.910" style="s2">saying a little bit I do think there are</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.430" end="01:16:42.440" style="s2">some sort of meta qualities particularly</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.910" end="01:16:45.380" style="s2">when thinking about game B leadership</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.440" end="01:16:49.700" style="s2">that are going to be critical and to me</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.380" end="01:16:53.630" style="s2">it comes down to are you capable of</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.700" end="01:16:55.190" style="s2">holding enough perspectives and updating</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.630" end="01:16:58.970" style="s2">your own perspective with enough</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.190" end="01:17:02.000" style="s2">epistemic humility that you can then</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.970" end="01:17:04.940" style="s2">help others make sense and mass towards</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.000" end="01:17:06.740" style="s2">it towards a shared goal so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.940" end="01:17:08.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot wrapped up in that right</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.740" end="01:17:09.950" style="s2">because we&#39;re talking about some</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.030" end="01:17:12.710" style="s2">difficult polarities to navigate you</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.950" end="01:17:14.390" style="s2">need to be able to on one hand be highly</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.710" end="01:17:17.330" style="s2">self skeptical of what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.390" end="01:17:20.120" style="s2">at the same time be willing to not to</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.330" end="01:17:22.130" style="s2">cut off the analysis and go to action</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.120" end="01:17:24.080" style="s2">you need to be able to hold a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.130" end="01:17:25.520" style="s2">perspectives and at the same time be</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.080" end="01:17:27.650" style="s2">able to identify that a lot of those</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.520" end="01:17:29.989" style="s2">perspectives are basically</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.650" end="01:17:32.719" style="s2">and being able to hold those polarities</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.989" end="01:17:34.880" style="s2">effectively I think is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.719" end="01:17:37.159" style="s2">required for anyone who wants to</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.880" end="01:17:40.100" style="s2">organize large groups of people towards</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.159" end="01:17:42.739" style="s2">complex goals in a minimally controlled</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.100" end="01:17:46.790" style="s2">structure hmm I like that so the</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.739" end="01:17:49.130" style="s2">openness but not to open attention</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.790" end="01:17:51.830" style="s2">between openness and the need to get to</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.130" end="01:17:54.530" style="s2">a decision yeah I see it as managing a</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.830" end="01:17:56.510" style="s2">polarity rather than a happy medium a</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.530" end="01:17:58.130" style="s2">lot of people fall down into the happy</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.510" end="01:18:00.340" style="s2">medium trap it&#39;s more like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.130" end="01:18:02.719" style="s2">willing to be radically open and</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.340" end="01:18:05.710" style="s2">radically skeptical of the assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.719" end="01:18:08.750" style="s2">that you&#39;ve made and simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.710" end="01:18:11.480" style="s2">willing to act very fast towards an end</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.750" end="01:18:14.030" style="s2">right being able to hold both of those</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.480" end="01:18:18.230" style="s2">as necessary and not water down either</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.030" end="01:18:21.650" style="s2">one that&#39;s that I think is pre is is</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.230" end="01:18:23.960" style="s2">hard and possible like I&#39;ve seen people</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.650" end="01:18:26.060" style="s2">who can do it and you know whether</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.960" end="01:18:28.130" style="s2">whether as you said that&#39;s a genetic</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.060" end="01:18:30.350" style="s2">thing or or whether it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.130" end="01:18:32.840" style="s2">can be taught I don&#39;t know I do know</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.350" end="01:18:35.210" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen people be able to get</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.840" end="01:18:37.070" style="s2">more and more clarity about what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.210" end="01:18:38.659" style="s2">a leader they are and if they are</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.070" end="01:18:40.850" style="s2">capable of doing that and if they even</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.659" end="01:18:42.860" style="s2">want to do that and at least that</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.850" end="01:18:44.270" style="s2">clarity has them not lie to themselves</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.860" end="01:18:46.580" style="s2">and that&#39;s a big step in the right</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.270" end="01:18:48.290" style="s2">direction yeah I would say interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.580" end="01:18:50.360" style="s2">your description of that is not too far</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.290" end="01:18:54.290" style="s2">from my game a leader style</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.360" end="01:18:56.870" style="s2">I think I was both radically open and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.290" end="01:18:58.730" style="s2">radically decisive you know certainly</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.870" end="01:19:00.920" style="s2">much more so than your average game a</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.730" end="01:19:02.270" style="s2"> so maybe I&#39;m not that far</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.920" end="01:19:03.560" style="s2">from a game Bay leader though I do think</p>

<p begin="01:19:05.870" end="01:19:09.710" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the confusion point right</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.610" end="01:19:12.159" style="s2">would be that assumption that the</p>

<p begin="01:19:12.159" end="01:19:16.640" style="s2">automatically would disqualify a model</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.719" end="01:19:18.790" style="s2">of game B leadership right that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.640" end="01:19:21.290" style="s2">sort of reactive move to certainty that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.790" end="01:19:23.420" style="s2">whatever type of leadership comes next</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.290" end="01:19:26.150" style="s2">can&#39;t look like the leadership we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.420" end="01:19:27.860" style="s2">before versus hey there might be some</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.150" end="01:19:29.600" style="s2">qualities that are just good for</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.860" end="01:19:30.980" style="s2">organizing groups of people that have</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.600" end="01:19:33.560" style="s2">been applied out in different structures</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.980" end="01:19:36.290" style="s2">and so let&#39;s take the best of those and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.560" end="01:19:37.760" style="s2">add to them the higher reaches of human</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.290" end="01:19:39.590" style="s2">development and cognition and the</p>

<p begin="01:19:40.660" end="01:19:44.350" style="s2">see what that looks like yep I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.060" end="01:19:47.170" style="s2">that&#39;s always good advice don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.350" end="01:19:48.730" style="s2">afraid of the past right the past had</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.170" end="01:19:49.990" style="s2">some errors in it but it also had some</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.730" end="01:19:52.150" style="s2">brilliant something we have to remember</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.990" end="01:19:55.270" style="s2">game a took us from a world where 95%</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.150" end="01:19:57.700" style="s2">were starving peasants 50% of kids died</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.270" end="01:19:59.620" style="s2">by the time they were 5 and led us to a</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.700" end="01:20:02.350" style="s2">world where life expectancy including</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.620" end="01:20:03.970" style="s2">the whole world&#39;s now over 70 and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.350" end="01:20:07.480" style="s2">number of kids that died before their 5</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.970" end="01:20:09.460" style="s2">is 1 or 2% so game a is not all wrong by</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.480" end="01:20:11.230" style="s2">any means and that we should not be</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.460" end="01:20:13.600" style="s2">afraid to look back and find what</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.230" end="01:20:15.670" style="s2">actually works yeah it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.600" end="01:20:18.700" style="s2">extraordinary cooperation system ever</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.670" end="01:20:20.200" style="s2">invented thus far yep and you know if it</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.700" end="01:20:22.330" style="s2">weren&#39;t for the fact that it&#39;s on itself</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.200" end="01:20:24.940" style="s2">terminating can&#39;t put on the brakes</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.330" end="01:20:26.980" style="s2">because of its underlying relentless</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.940" end="01:20:28.870" style="s2">short-term money on money return there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.980" end="01:20:30.850" style="s2">a lot to be said for it well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.870" end="01:20:32.200" style="s2">also some others not so nice things to</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.850" end="01:20:34.810" style="s2">be said for it like the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.200" end="01:20:37.690" style="s2">alienation that it creates in people the</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.810" end="01:20:40.330" style="s2">number of manufactured psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.690" end="01:20:41.830" style="s2">astute needs that it manufactures in</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.330" end="01:20:43.870" style="s2">people to keep them on the hedonic</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.830" end="01:20:45.220" style="s2">treadmill but there are a lot of good</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.870" end="01:20:47.470" style="s2">things to be said for it and we</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.220" end="01:20:49.030" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be reactive against every</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.470" end="01:20:52.600" style="s2">possible lesson that we may have learned</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.030" end="01:20:55.210" style="s2">in gaming total sync that was really</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.600" end="01:20:56.380" style="s2">good Jake let&#39;s go to our final topic</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.210" end="01:20:59.860" style="s2">which is one of the things we talked</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.380" end="01:21:02.920" style="s2">about in game B a lot is that none of us</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.860" end="01:21:05.680" style="s2">are really prepared for this game a</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.920" end="01:21:08.080" style="s2">world and we&#39;re carrying a fair amount</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.680" end="01:21:10.120" style="s2">of what we call game a malware you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.080" end="01:21:12.280" style="s2">the trainings from the time we were</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.120" end="01:21:14.650" style="s2">young sitting in the sausage factory</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.280" end="01:21:17.200" style="s2">public school systems you know abusive</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.650" end="01:21:18.880" style="s2">bosses we&#39;ve had along the way and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.200" end="01:21:21.640" style="s2">idea is that there are a series of</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.880" end="01:21:23.320" style="s2">psycho technologies things that could go</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.640" end="01:21:25.720" style="s2">at the lighter end from you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.320" end="01:21:28.890" style="s2">mindfulness meditation to nootropic</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.720" end="01:21:31.420" style="s2">drugs to psychedelics to mind machine</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.890" end="01:21:33.820" style="s2">implants to a whole series of other</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.420" end="01:21:35.290" style="s2">possible practices breath work whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.820" end="01:21:37.770" style="s2"> that is but something people talk</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.290" end="01:21:40.660" style="s2">about do you have any insight into</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.770" end="01:21:42.820" style="s2">psycho technologies and ones that might</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.660" end="01:21:45.220" style="s2">be relevant or that you&#39;ve seen used</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.820" end="01:21:47.410" style="s2">successfully in helping upgrade the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.220" end="01:21:51.550" style="s2">capability of people to manage</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.410" end="01:21:53.200" style="s2">particularly self-manage in groups yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.550" end="01:21:55.960" style="s2">so this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.200" end="01:21:58.510" style="s2">so a yes absolutely I&#39;m a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.960" end="01:22:01.510" style="s2">psycho technology I don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.510" end="01:22:03.460" style="s2">would call it a pet aficionado whatever</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.510" end="01:22:05.500" style="s2">it is I like to try stuff and see how it</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.460" end="01:22:08.200" style="s2">goes that&#39;s just kind of built into into</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.500" end="01:22:10.000" style="s2">my own mental model but I would start</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.200" end="01:22:11.680" style="s2">rather than just sort of listing things</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.000" end="01:22:14.490" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen work or not work</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.680" end="01:22:17.260" style="s2">I would rather start with an orientation</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.490" end="01:22:20.890" style="s2">which is what&#39;s going back to the body</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.260" end="01:22:23.890" style="s2">of our conversation is what are you</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.890" end="01:22:26.680" style="s2">trying to do what is the actual goal</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.890" end="01:22:29.020" style="s2">right there&#39;s a lot of times I see</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.680" end="01:22:32.200" style="s2">people go to psycho technologies mostly</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.020" end="01:22:33.940" style="s2">because they just don&#39;t feel good right</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.200" end="01:22:35.830" style="s2">they just have that impulse if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.940" end="01:22:38.050" style="s2">like the way I feel therefore I will try</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.830" end="01:22:39.430" style="s2">something right which is not all that</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.050" end="01:22:41.620" style="s2">different than the impulse that gets</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.430" end="01:22:43.270" style="s2">people to go binge watch TV or do heavy</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.620" end="01:22:46.690" style="s2">drugs or whatever it is all these</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.270" end="01:22:49.240" style="s2">different addictive patterns so like any</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.690" end="01:22:52.090" style="s2">technology I would I would want to start</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.240" end="01:22:54.280" style="s2">with with going back to that that bigger</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.090" end="01:22:55.960" style="s2">clarity of what actually matters what</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.280" end="01:22:57.640" style="s2">are my intensional goals here what am I</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.960" end="01:23:01.600" style="s2">going for and if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.640" end="01:23:05.230" style="s2">game B I believe the goal is how how do</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.600" end="01:23:08.950" style="s2">I expand my frame of reference enough</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.230" end="01:23:12.250" style="s2">that I can catch my patterns early that</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.950" end="01:23:14.080" style="s2">I can do that switch from confusion into</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.250" end="01:23:16.330" style="s2">awareness rather than confusion into</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.080" end="01:23:19.330" style="s2">threat because it&#39;s really hard to catch</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.330" end="01:23:21.730" style="s2">in the moment and to me that ability to</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.330" end="01:23:23.410" style="s2">catch it and to be able to be expansive</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.730" end="01:23:25.870" style="s2">enough that you can hold that polarity</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.410" end="01:23:28.840" style="s2">of perspective checking and action</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.870" end="01:23:30.820" style="s2">taking that is the goal that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.840" end="01:23:32.740" style="s2">worthy of using psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.820" end="01:23:35.410" style="s2">because a lot of this stuff is powerful</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.740" end="01:23:37.480" style="s2">and I think can kind of lead people off</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.410" end="01:23:40.780" style="s2">track if they&#39;re not using it towards a</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.480" end="01:23:43.140" style="s2">meaningful end so with that said right I</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.780" end="01:23:45.760" style="s2">do think meditation is fantastic think</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.140" end="01:23:49.150" style="s2">guy named Geoffrey Martin has done some</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.760" end="01:23:50.740" style="s2">really interesting research on people</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.150" end="01:23:53.080" style="s2">who have transitioned into what he calls</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.740" end="01:23:54.790" style="s2">fundamental well-being which maps onto a</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.080" end="01:23:57.880" style="s2">lot of descriptions of enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.790" end="01:24:00.130" style="s2">sort of demystifying that and looking at</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.880" end="01:24:03.820" style="s2">the different ways that you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.130" end="01:24:05.860" style="s2">create that relatively easily but I</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.820" end="01:24:06.190" style="s2">think I think meditation is a great one</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.860" end="01:24:07.630" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.190" end="01:24:10.780" style="s2">lots of different meditations out there</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.630" end="01:24:13.510" style="s2">anything that&#39;s going to create a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.780" end="01:24:17.290" style="s2">a buffer zone between stimulus and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.510" end="01:24:19.980" style="s2">response is really powerful so you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.290" end="01:24:22.780" style="s2">if you&#39;re if meditation does that great</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.980" end="01:24:24.699" style="s2">you know some people use nootropics for</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.780" end="01:24:26.590" style="s2">that though I think again if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.699" end="01:24:28.660" style="s2">speeding up your underlying processing</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.590" end="01:24:30.130" style="s2">power without actually distancing</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.660" end="01:24:34.020" style="s2">stimulus and response then you probably</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.130" end="01:24:36.489" style="s2">aren&#39;t doing yourself much much good</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.020" end="01:24:40.230" style="s2">relational practices I think are great I</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.489" end="01:24:42.520" style="s2">spent a while out and Boulder learning</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.230" end="01:24:43.600" style="s2">circling and something that could you</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.520" end="01:24:44.800" style="s2">have something they call circling which</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.600" end="01:24:46.650" style="s2">is basically can interpersonal</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.800" end="01:24:48.760" style="s2">meditation where you&#39;re tracking</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.650" end="01:24:51.699" style="s2">yourself in relationship to another</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.760" end="01:24:53.680" style="s2">again being able to practice that sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.699" end="01:24:56.410" style="s2">of gap between stimulus and response in</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.680" end="01:24:58.060" style="s2">a relational context which you know is</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.410" end="01:25:00.400" style="s2">where a lot of meditators with solo</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.060" end="01:25:03.550" style="s2">practices fall down I think that can be</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.400" end="01:25:06.190" style="s2">really potent polarity mapping there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.550" end="01:25:08.020" style="s2">woman named bina Sharma who does amazing</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.190" end="01:25:10.080" style="s2">work with polarity mapping so getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.020" end="01:25:14.050" style="s2">starting to get used to that idea of</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.080" end="01:25:16.239" style="s2">okay I can actually hold and pursue two</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.050" end="01:25:19.060" style="s2">seemingly diametrically opposed things</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.060" end="01:25:27.070" style="s2">develop that skill I believe is enormous</p>

<p begin="01:25:29.199" end="01:25:34.780" style="s2">that come to top of mind you know the</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.719" end="01:25:36.430" style="s2">the big one for me more than anything is</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.780" end="01:25:38.710" style="s2">just learning to treat life as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.430" end="01:25:40.420" style="s2">practice like if there is any single</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.710" end="01:25:42.670" style="s2">psycho technology that I have gotten</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.420" end="01:25:45.219" style="s2">more out of than any other it is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.670" end="01:25:47.830" style="s2">fundamental shift in orientation from</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.219" end="01:25:52.210" style="s2">life as a series of tasks to life as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.830" end="01:25:54.070" style="s2">series of experiments so if I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.210" end="01:25:56.410" style="s2">out to the grocery store what am i</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.070" end="01:25:57.969" style="s2">noticing how am i behaving how am i</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.410" end="01:25:59.560" style="s2">treating the people around me how much</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.969" end="01:26:01.810" style="s2">am i aware of if I&#39;m getting into</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.560" end="01:26:04.300" style="s2">conflict with my wife or my family or a</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.810" end="01:26:07.060" style="s2">co-worker how am i showing up in that</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.300" end="01:26:09.489" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.060" end="01:26:11.199" style="s2">many people who use these psycho</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.489" end="01:26:14.469" style="s2">technologies I think tend to think of</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.199" end="01:26:16.750" style="s2">them as these discrete things that live</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.469" end="01:26:18.610" style="s2">in a particular practice space rather</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.750" end="01:26:20.130" style="s2">than recognizing that all that really</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.610" end="01:26:22.200" style="s2">matters is how your</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.130" end="01:26:24.690" style="s2">and whether you&#39;re able to consistently</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.200" end="01:26:26.700" style="s2">create that stimulus-response distance</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.690" end="01:26:28.960" style="s2">in a way that enables you to get from</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.700" end="01:26:32.380" style="s2">confusion to clarity</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.960" end="01:26:34.150" style="s2">hmm I like that well said I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.380" end="01:26:36.880" style="s2">a good review and I also very much liked</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.150" end="01:26:38.680" style="s2">that you called out the fact that a lot</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.880" end="01:26:41.980" style="s2">of people unfortunately use these things</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.680" end="01:26:43.780" style="s2">as analgesics essentially right when</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.980" end="01:26:45.220" style="s2">they&#39;re in pain they go for a hit of it</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.780" end="01:26:47.830" style="s2">which is understandable if it works</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.220" end="01:26:50.200" style="s2">great but rather than using it more</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.830" end="01:26:52.780" style="s2">constructively to build their capability</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.200" end="01:26:54.610" style="s2">I think you did a nice job of reviewing</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.780" end="01:26:56.800" style="s2">the landscape and particularly I liked</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.610" end="01:26:58.870" style="s2">the perspective of really these things</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.800" end="01:27:01.420" style="s2">are a means to an end which is allowing</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.870" end="01:27:03.220" style="s2">us to process the world and turn</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.420" end="01:27:05.380" style="s2">confusion to clarity</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.220" end="01:27:07.270" style="s2">whereas I sometimes would say the you</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.380" end="01:27:09.550" style="s2">know the main skill of a businessperson</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.270" end="01:27:11.380" style="s2">is just to reduce ambiguity right is</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.550" end="01:27:13.300" style="s2">what we run into ambiguity all the time</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.380" end="01:27:14.590" style="s2">and if you&#39;re afraid of it and you lock</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.300" end="01:27:16.180" style="s2">up you&#39;re not gonna make any progress</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.590" end="01:27:18.700" style="s2">you just have to live in the ambiguity</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.180" end="01:27:21.820" style="s2">for a while and then gradually chip away</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.700" end="01:27:23.980" style="s2">at it until clarity emerges absolutely</p>
