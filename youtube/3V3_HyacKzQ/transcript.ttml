<p begin="00:01:25.730" end="00:01:31.010" style="s2">started here the last two episodes if</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.970" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">you haven&#39;t been watching them have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.010" end="00:01:36.860" style="s2">dedicated to kind of a militant takedown</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:38.690" style="s2">of the blue church and it&#39;s been it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.860" end="00:01:40.910" style="s2">fairly aggressive toned so in this one</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.690" end="00:01:43.700" style="s2">one I&#39;m gonna turn it down a bit because</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.910" end="00:01:46.300" style="s2">in the last episode I made heavy</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.700" end="00:01:50.360" style="s2">allusion to the concept of alchemy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.300" end="00:01:51.560" style="s2">the concept was lost on a few points and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.360" end="00:01:54.350" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna dedicate this entire</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.560" end="00:01:56.630" style="s2">episode to what is alchemy how did it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.350" end="00:01:58.580" style="s2">come to be why is it a thing and what</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.630" end="00:02:01.700" style="s2">can we do about and why am I so focused</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.580" end="00:02:06.730" style="s2">on it right now my mouse is being very</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.700" end="00:02:10.660" style="s2">erratic I do apologize hold on this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.730" end="00:02:10.660" style="s2">technical glitches are always a pain</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.379" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">excellent just do that there so I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.470" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">like to get started but I&#39;m having the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:23.959" style="s2">worst time trying to get started here my</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:26.540" style="s2">mouse is really really on the fritz so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.959" end="00:02:28.219" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna wing it we&#39;re gonna run a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.540" end="00:02:30.430" style="s2">focus on this sorry for being flustered</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.219" end="00:02:30.430" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.690" end="00:02:35.350" style="s2">there&#39;s the share screen here we go</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.510" end="00:02:37.420" style="s2">that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.350" end="00:02:39.130" style="s2">so this season is called devouring</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.420" end="00:02:40.870" style="s2">humanism and that&#39;s a play on words</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.130" end="00:02:42.700" style="s2">either the humanism is to borrowing you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.870" end="00:02:45.190" style="s2">or we devour it back this is episode</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.700" end="00:02:47.500" style="s2">three our chemical cognition the reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.190" end="00:02:50.920" style="s2">I&#39;m picking out chem alchemy is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:52.870" style="s2">it is the one of the first casualties of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.920" end="00:02:54.820" style="s2">the Scientific Revolution when</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.870" end="00:02:56.470" style="s2">scientific methodology came into be they</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.820" end="00:02:58.450" style="s2">quickly had a falling-out between</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.470" end="00:03:00.490" style="s2">philosophy and science and set out</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.450" end="00:03:03.850" style="s2">alchemy needs to go away because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.490" end="00:03:06.700" style="s2">going to measure everything and so for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.850" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">while that was okay and we got all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.700" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">of cool things out of it like computers</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:13.150" style="s2">or coca-cola that was not a Coca Cola ad</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:15.430" style="s2">they&#39;re not paying me but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.150" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">unfortunate part is we&#39;re rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.430" end="00:03:20.500" style="s2">approaching a situation where we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.650" end="00:03:24.160" style="s2">need this again one for our own defense</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.500" end="00:03:25.510" style="s2">and two for our own progress the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.160" end="00:03:29.110" style="s2">church will disagree with me heavily on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.510" end="00:03:40.510" style="s2">that so this whole deck is my attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.110" end="00:03:44.440" style="s2">explain why you need it so alchemy chem</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.510" end="00:03:46.269" style="s2">that&#39;s it it&#39;s Ken al is the Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.440" end="00:03:49.000" style="s2">edition meaning though but Ken where did</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.269" end="00:03:52.989" style="s2">chem come from it came from ham</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.000" end="00:03:54.010" style="s2">surprisingly the son of Noah and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.989" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">all technically members of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.010" end="00:03:58.330" style="s2">prestigious know a yacht club according</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:04:02.500" style="s2">to the Bible and he had a couple kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.330" end="00:04:05.019" style="s2">one of them was ham and that was going</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.500" end="00:04:07.390" style="s2">well for a little bit you know put all</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.019" end="00:04:09.070" style="s2">the animals in the boat and then it all</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.390" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">went pretty well until no I had some</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.070" end="00:04:14.860" style="s2">rowdy naked juice and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.900" style="s2">there was those dingdong Fiasco where</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.860" end="00:04:18.669" style="s2">him saw his dad naked and that didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.900" end="00:04:20.410" style="s2">so well for him so he cursed him and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.669" end="00:04:23.200" style="s2">said you have the curse of ham you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.410" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">going to be a servant forever now ham</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.200" end="00:04:28.900" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily a servant but his son</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:31.720" style="s2">was Kenan I believe so that&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.900" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">this is where the ham comes from now and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.720" end="00:04:37.570" style="s2">we call it ham now because ham is often</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:39.700" style="s2">delicious but in the region where this</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.570" end="00:04:42.849" style="s2">word originated from it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.700" end="00:04:45.969" style="s2">pronounced hum so hum</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.849" end="00:04:48.669" style="s2">so you have that that that guttural CH</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.969" end="00:04:50.889" style="s2">noise so when it was first written down</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.669" end="00:04:54.159" style="s2">in English or at least other languages</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.889" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">latinized languages came out as as Cham</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.159" end="00:04:58.419" style="s2">actually even though it&#39;s pronounced hum</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:58.869" style="s2">so it came out as Cham when when you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.419" end="00:05:02.309" style="s2">wrote it down</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.869" end="00:05:04.509" style="s2">well Chum is there&#39;s a reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.309" end="00:05:07.779" style="s2">because it turns out a lot of Himes</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.509" end="00:05:10.569" style="s2">descendants became Egyptians that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.779" end="00:05:15.009" style="s2">actually the lineage of ham is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.569" end="00:05:17.319" style="s2">his descendants became Egyptians now the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.009" end="00:05:20.289" style="s2">word Egypt comes from the Greek I get</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.319" end="00:05:23.559" style="s2">this which means part face boy has some</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.289" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">racism right there but also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.559" end="00:05:29.529" style="s2">another net and a definition of Egypt as</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:31.599" style="s2">well it&#39;s called hem cuz because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.529" end="00:05:34.209" style="s2">sons of the sons of Noah the sons of ham</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.599" end="00:05:36.809" style="s2">the sons of ham and that does Kim so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.209" end="00:05:42.569" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of this weird evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.809" end="00:05:44.919" style="s2">etymology here where it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.569" end="00:05:46.959" style="s2">surprisingly even Syria calls itself the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.919" end="00:05:48.930" style="s2">land of Khem and that&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.959" end="00:05:51.789" style="s2">important part of the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.930" end="00:05:54.279" style="s2">mythology of islam as well so you see a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.789" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">lot of radical Islamists they actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.279" end="00:05:58.899" style="s2">used this Apocrypha notation to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:01.569" style="s2">attract some of the more serious</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.899" end="00:06:04.050" style="s2">jihadists into that region which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.569" end="00:06:07.029" style="s2">going very poorly for everyone involved</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.050" end="00:06:10.329" style="s2">but this is all director of Haman even</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.029" end="00:06:12.219" style="s2">like when when American slavery was up</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.329" end="00:06:13.569" style="s2">and roaring a lot of the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.219" end="00:06:15.279" style="s2">justification was to say well your</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.569" end="00:06:18.099" style="s2">slaves cuz cuz that&#39;s the curse of ham</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.279" end="00:06:19.719" style="s2">you know your that&#39;s that&#39;s life sorry</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.099" end="00:06:20.889" style="s2">pal you got cursed by Noah cuz you saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.719" end="00:06:22.809" style="s2">those ding-dongs so now your slaves</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.889" end="00:06:24.939" style="s2">forever not exactly the best</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.809" end="00:06:30.819" style="s2">rationalization but it&#39;s all they had at</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.939" end="00:06:32.499" style="s2">the time and so chemic was also a part</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.819" end="00:06:35.529" style="s2">of Egypt and it meant the black lands</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.499" end="00:06:38.709" style="s2">and the Arabic word for alchemy which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.529" end="00:06:41.649" style="s2">alchimia it means the egyptian science</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.709" end="00:06:43.179" style="s2">so alchemy literally translates to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.649" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">black arts for all of these reasons</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.179" end="00:06:46.990" style="s2">that&#39;s where you know you hear the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:48.610" style="s2">mystical black art wording this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.990" end="00:06:52.120" style="s2">etymology of it and now that I&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.610" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">you down this kind of Pepe Silvia route</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.120" end="00:06:56.440" style="s2">of how this word came to be we could</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">actually move on and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.440" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">talk about you know what is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:01.410" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s not necessarily just</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:03.160" style="s2">what are these Egyptians doing although</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.410" end="00:07:05.590" style="s2">comparatively speaking they built</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.160" end="00:07:07.150" style="s2">fucking mountains like that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.590" end="00:07:09.190" style="s2">right so what kind of black magic were</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.150" end="00:07:11.800" style="s2">they using there so that&#39;s that was also</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.190" end="00:07:14.920" style="s2">part of the mythology and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.800" end="00:07:17.050" style="s2">the antiquity Bronze Age stuff so well</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.920" end="00:07:19.870" style="s2">we&#39;ll move into how the Grecians got</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.050" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">involved in this going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.870" end="00:07:25.180" style="s2">egyptian mythology we start with Imhotep</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:28.300" style="s2">he was the advisor Joe Joseph and he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.180" end="00:07:30.820" style="s2">the world&#39;s first deified artist the guy</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.300" end="00:07:34.090" style="s2">was a brilliant mathematician geometry</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.820" end="00:07:36.670" style="s2">and architect for all kinds of pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.090" end="00:07:39.790" style="s2">and because of his brilliance he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.670" end="00:07:43.620" style="s2">actually deified surprisingly and his</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.790" end="00:07:46.060" style="s2">deification is often confused with off</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.620" end="00:07:48.550" style="s2">it was the moon god of wisdom magic</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.060" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">causality measurement judgment law and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.550" end="00:07:52.210" style="s2">basically Roz secretary so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:55.000" style="s2">thought the idea of like tight</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.210" end="00:07:56.890" style="s2">measurement careful autistic definitions</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.000" end="00:07:59.320" style="s2">of everything yeah in hotep and Thoth</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.890" end="00:08:04.150" style="s2">are pretty interchangeable in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.320" end="00:08:05.980" style="s2">see the hotep where Thoth center was you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:10.120" style="s2">see there&#39;s there&#39;s often statue</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.980" end="00:08:12.970" style="s2">confusion between the two so also</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.120" end="00:08:14.320" style="s2">surprisingly Thoth in antiquity or at</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.970" end="00:08:16.870" style="s2">least an alchemical II was confused it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.320" end="00:08:19.240" style="s2">Moses as well because Moses is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.870" end="00:08:21.820" style="s2">lawgiver the the premier of measurement</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.240" end="00:08:23.500" style="s2">the bringer of of doling out precise</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.820" end="00:08:27.700" style="s2">units all these three people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.500" end="00:08:30.130" style="s2">dedicated to like measuring stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.700" end="00:08:31.900" style="s2">then we throw in Hermes and he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.130" end="00:08:33.490" style="s2">messenger of the gods and a soul guide</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.900" end="00:08:35.820" style="s2">who would escort souls into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.490" end="00:08:37.930" style="s2">afterlife now this is a bit of a jump</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.820" end="00:08:39.400" style="s2">saying these things should all get</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.930" end="00:08:41.320" style="s2">confused together but remember the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.400" end="00:08:43.450" style="s2">purpose of a messenger was also to bring</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.320" end="00:08:46.330" style="s2">law and to bring justice you were to run</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.450" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">to this location and bring this measured</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.330" end="00:08:52.600" style="s2">message to legal delivery and so all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:55.210" style="s2">these things kind of revolve around the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.600" end="00:08:58.180" style="s2">same concept roughly so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.210" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">when you add them all together will you</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.180" end="00:09:02.980" style="s2">come up with this guy whose name I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:05.280" style="s2">always going to maggle and that&#39;s Hermes</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.980" end="00:09:05.280" style="s2">Trismegistus</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.910" end="00:09:11.780" style="s2">but that guy right so this guy is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.160" end="00:09:16.530" style="s2">this mythical</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.780" end="00:09:19.590" style="s2">gnostic hermetic entity that pops up</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.530" end="00:09:21.840" style="s2">whenever societies go total autism so</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.590" end="00:09:24.210" style="s2">they go like they measure everything and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.840" end="00:09:25.950" style="s2">they&#39;re really about pure reason and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.210" end="00:09:27.870" style="s2">they&#39;re about like sticking to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.950" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">letter of the law well this guy shows up</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.870" end="00:09:32.280" style="s2">every so often that happens there</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:33.660" style="s2">whenever people really like stick to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.280" end="00:09:35.820" style="s2">letter instead of the spirit of the law</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.660" end="00:09:38.010" style="s2">this guy comes along in mythological</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.820" end="00:09:39.930" style="s2">history and it kind of confuses things</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.010" end="00:09:41.550" style="s2">he kind of comes in and says yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.930" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">here&#39;s some gray area here there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.550" end="00:09:46.670" style="s2">weird stuff here you shouldn&#39;t get so</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:49.410" style="s2">hung up on the words and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.670" end="00:09:51.330" style="s2">and so this this particular Hermes guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.410" end="00:09:53.820" style="s2">is actually an edition of Thoth and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.330" end="00:09:57.000" style="s2">Hermes in the gnostic tradition and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.820" end="00:09:58.130" style="s2">the Hermetic tradition as well in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.000" end="00:10:01.410" style="s2">you may have heard the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.130" end="00:10:03.180" style="s2">hermetically sealed in medical context</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.410" end="00:10:05.970" style="s2">well that&#39;s where this comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.180" end="00:10:07.350" style="s2">idea of how chemically sealing stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.970" end="00:10:10.140" style="s2">air doesn&#39;t get in that was only</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.350" end="00:10:11.820" style="s2">possible using alchemical processes at</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.140" end="00:10:13.590" style="s2">the time and surprisingly that word has</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.820" end="00:10:17.160" style="s2">stuck through for most of scientific and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.590" end="00:10:18.900" style="s2">medical usage hilariously so this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.160" end="00:10:22.080" style="s2">guy is like an archetype that pops up</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.900" end="00:10:24.510" style="s2">whenever people get too robotic about</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.080" end="00:10:26.940" style="s2">their own existences so it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.510" end="00:10:31.050" style="s2">that this guy&#39;s popping up now and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.940" end="00:10:33.480" style="s2">the internet place right now so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.050" end="00:10:38.130" style="s2">addition to that that that Hermes</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.480" end="00:10:40.620" style="s2">character that was a Grecian Egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.130" end="00:10:42.900" style="s2">fusion and you see a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.620" end="00:10:45.330" style="s2">alchemists of medieval Europe really go</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.900" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">towards that character around the the 13</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.330" end="00:10:50.940" style="s2">and in the 1500s and that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:54.450" style="s2">because the the international entity</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.940" end="00:10:56.340" style="s2">known as the papal Church was was really</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.450" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">sticking it to people in terms of legal</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.340" end="00:10:59.520" style="s2">application and you know follow the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:01.080" style="s2">letter of the law in addition to the law</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.520" end="00:11:03.030" style="s2">of your king follow the law of the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.080" end="00:11:04.770" style="s2">follow the law of God follow our laws</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.030" end="00:11:08.550" style="s2">all these laws all over the place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.770" end="00:11:10.440" style="s2">just a mess so so when the alchemists of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.550" end="00:11:13.470" style="s2">the Middle Ages come into play</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.440" end="00:11:15.000" style="s2">their initial obsession is turning lead</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.470" end="00:11:17.490" style="s2">into gold using what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.000" end="00:11:21.420" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.490" end="00:11:23.650" style="s2">most people kind of get into alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.420" end="00:11:26.440" style="s2">probably because a Harry Potter</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.650" end="00:11:28.030" style="s2">but the it&#39;s much more than that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.440" end="00:11:30.370" style="s2">it&#39;s much more than it looks like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.030" end="00:11:32.530" style="s2">idea that you can turn lead into gold is</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.370" end="00:11:34.510" style="s2">obviously an attractor for all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.530" end="00:11:36.280" style="s2">talent people who kind of understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.510" end="00:11:38.050" style="s2">chemistry you can think of it as a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.280" end="00:11:40.540" style="s2">because it is you can think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.050" end="00:11:42.970" style="s2">way to attract people out of their black</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.540" end="00:11:44.680" style="s2">art Cubbins which they&#39;re scattered all</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.970" end="00:11:47.580" style="s2">across the place it&#39;s not like there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.680" end="00:11:50.140" style="s2">one black art academy that you can go to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.580" end="00:11:52.180" style="s2">you had individual people who were</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.140" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">keeping their secrets really tight to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.180" end="00:11:55.900" style="s2">their chests sometimes stuff worked</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">sometimes it didn&#39;t but if it worked it</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.900" end="00:11:58.960" style="s2">really worked and you didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:00.340" style="s2">share that with everybody if I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.960" end="00:12:01.960" style="s2">these chemical compounds could cure a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.340" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">sickness yeah I&#39;m keeping that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.960" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">thanks bro you can pay me and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.090" style="s2">gonna rock that all time and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:08.920" style="s2">gonna know I&#39;m gonna be hesitant to even</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.090" end="00:12:10.330" style="s2">give that to my apprentices so how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.920" end="00:12:12.640" style="s2">you how do you get all this talent who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.310" end="00:12:19.000" style="s2">like alchemical open source well you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.710" end="00:12:21.130" style="s2">come up with this mythology saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.000" end="00:12:22.930" style="s2">turning lead into gold so everybody you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.130" end="00:12:25.270" style="s2">know try your magic stuff here we go</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.030" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">actually trying to do the thing and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:35.350" style="s2">wrap up this mythology as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:37.330" style="s2">philosopher&#39;s stone and there was a time</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.350" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">in English history where the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.330" end="00:12:41.260" style="s2">with the people believed the English had</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.670" end="00:12:42.910" style="s2">a philosopher&#39;s stone and that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.260" end="00:12:45.250" style="s2">French were invading to steal it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.910" end="00:12:48.670" style="s2">that was used as justification to raise</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.250" end="00:12:50.440" style="s2">like defenses militarily it&#39;s it so it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.670" end="00:12:52.780" style="s2">was a wild tradition it was a wildly</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.440" end="00:12:55.030" style="s2">useful tool to to rally people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.780" end="00:12:57.520" style="s2">almost as if the myth of the stone was</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.030" end="00:12:59.350" style="s2">out communing of itself</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.520" end="00:13:01.300" style="s2">and the idea of the stone is really</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.350" end="00:13:07.260" style="s2">personified on what&#39;s known as emblem 21</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:53.079" style="s2">whole part about michael mayer and the</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.670" end="00:14:02.199" style="s2">things this and this are pretty linked</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.430" end="00:14:03.670" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking about egyptians and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.199" end="00:14:05.350" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about black art and now</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.350" end="00:14:10.300" style="s2">so so that&#39;s that&#39;s where all this comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.959" end="00:14:11.769" style="s2">from and an Isaac Newton was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.300" end="00:14:13.240" style="s2">practitioner of alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.769" end="00:14:18.490" style="s2">it was it&#39;s considered actually the last</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.240" end="00:14:21.610" style="s2">magician in some circles so this whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.490" end="00:14:22.209" style="s2">thing is a long tradition and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.610" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">messy</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.209" end="00:14:26.319" style="s2">everyone&#39;s our chemical practices are</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:28.509" style="s2">different everywhere you go and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.319" end="00:14:30.310" style="s2">because of this it was a foolish attempt</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.509" end="00:14:32.170" style="s2">at turning lead into gold this this lie</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.310" end="00:14:34.690" style="s2">this grand promise that was possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.170" end="00:14:36.850" style="s2">actually directly led to the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.690" end="00:14:38.769" style="s2">Atomics atomic theory in particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.850" end="00:14:40.569" style="s2">because people were then forced to like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.769" end="00:14:42.010" style="s2">okay can you actually do the thing can</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.569" end="00:14:44.350" style="s2">you do the thing it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.010" end="00:14:46.810" style="s2">reputation check it was like a mass mass</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.350" end="00:14:48.339" style="s2">accountability effort to say all right</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.810" end="00:14:51.880" style="s2">what can you actually do about nature</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.339" end="00:14:54.430" style="s2">and so this pursuit kind of went to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.880" end="00:14:55.870" style="s2">wayside after the Spanish invaded South</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.430" end="00:14:58.269" style="s2">America and they brought back all that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.870" end="00:14:59.800" style="s2">gold there eventually so full of gold</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.269" end="00:15:01.690" style="s2">that they just stopped this this silly</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.800" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2">pursuit of the Philosopher&#39;s Stone after</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.690" end="00:15:04.870" style="s2">that they actually uh did a severe</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:06.490" style="s2">hyperinflation of gold and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.870" end="00:15:09.329" style="s2">their economy for like you know 100</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.490" end="00:15:09.329" style="s2">years it was pretty bad</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.910" end="00:15:16.300" style="s2">and so this is where because the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.029" end="00:15:19.959" style="s2">alchemists are successfully making</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.300" end="00:15:21.579" style="s2">progress in terms of iterating towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.959" end="00:15:22.779" style="s2">something that&#39;s measurable and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.579" end="00:15:24.130" style="s2">something that&#39;s repeatable and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.779" end="00:15:26.290" style="s2">something that&#39;s more compliant to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.130" end="00:15:28.029" style="s2">scientific methodology instead of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.290" end="00:15:30.310" style="s2">well if you boil two frogs legs and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.029" end="00:15:31.779" style="s2">you&#39;re around your head and you jump up</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.310" end="00:15:33.819" style="s2">and down you got a whooping cough cure</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.779" end="00:15:35.889" style="s2">you you could say that all day long but</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.819" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">because the the pursuit of the out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.889" end="00:15:40.420" style="s2">the Philosopher&#39;s Stone and turning lead</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:42.069" style="s2">into gold that was that reputation check</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.420" end="00:15:43.870" style="s2">actually was beginning to lay the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.069" end="00:15:46.120" style="s2">foundation for scientific methodology</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.870" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">and all the things there and at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.120" end="00:15:50.050" style="s2">point we&#39;re starting to see a divide</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:51.490" style="s2">between philosophy and science and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.050" end="00:15:54.850" style="s2">ultimately ends up in a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.490" end="00:15:58.029" style="s2">also divorce its Galileo he&#39;s a loader</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.850" end="00:15:59.470" style="s2">of people bias and academia he had hit a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.029" end="00:16:03.040" style="s2">lot of beef with the church to the point</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.470" end="00:16:06.970" style="s2">he got exiled I think twice from all all</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.040" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">of Christendom and he he said this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.970" end="00:16:10.209" style="s2">stupid fuck this fuck that I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">actually you know that&#39;s the moon I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.209" end="00:16:13.540" style="s2">gonna make it look really close at it I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:15.010" style="s2">think the strongest argument the church</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.540" end="00:16:17.080" style="s2">had at the time is if you had a really</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.010" end="00:16:17.830" style="s2">long stick you could poke the moon and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.080" end="00:16:20.380" style="s2">that was like the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.830" end="00:16:22.420" style="s2">counter-argument it&#39;s like I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.380" end="00:16:24.550" style="s2">that&#39;s a really long stick</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.420" end="00:16:26.410" style="s2">but Galileo is able to really lay the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.550" end="00:16:27.880" style="s2">foundation not only scientifically and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.410" end="00:16:29.800" style="s2">say look I&#39;m not only am i observing</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.880" end="00:16:31.660" style="s2">these astrological features I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.800" end="00:16:33.880" style="s2">start predicting them as well and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.660" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">does and people say oh shit there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.880" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">you know something&#39;s here and so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.310" end="00:16:41.770" style="s2">idea of measuring nature starts to take</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:45.550" style="s2">precedence over the over the over both</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.770" end="00:16:48.810" style="s2">the mystical of alchemy and the divine</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.550" end="00:16:51.520" style="s2">of the church so these two like non</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.810" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">measured things that claimed legal</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.520" end="00:16:55.330" style="s2">authority and then here comes science</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:57.250" style="s2">science is saying we&#39;re measuring stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.330" end="00:17:01.240" style="s2">now fuck off go away this is measure</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.250" end="00:17:03.940" style="s2">time so this whole this this is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.240" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">beginning of the divorce and we get to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.940" end="00:17:07.630" style="s2">the end of the divorce with the Vienna</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:09.400" style="s2">circle so these guys you might recognize</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.630" end="00:17:11.980" style="s2">a few of these faces especially sad boy</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.400" end="00:17:14.140" style="s2">over there but these guys were hell-bent</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.980" end="00:17:15.610" style="s2">on destroying metaphysics they just</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.140" end="00:17:17.589" style="s2">couldn&#39;t stand it they didn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.610" end="00:17:21.490" style="s2">they didn&#39;t like any of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.589" end="00:17:22.540" style="s2">and the names not important you can look</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.490" end="00:17:24.520" style="s2">them up if you know em you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.540" end="00:17:26.530" style="s2">don&#39;t doesn&#39;t really matter but this was</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.520" end="00:17:29.350" style="s2">this was a group of people who really</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.530" end="00:17:31.210" style="s2">doubled down hard on on the measurement</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.350" end="00:17:33.340" style="s2">century the idea that everything can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.210" end="00:17:34.630" style="s2">measured and fuck you we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.340" end="00:17:37.420" style="s2">measure everything even if you disagree</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.630" end="00:17:38.950" style="s2">so now now science is getting its balls</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.420" end="00:17:41.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s starting to charge headlong</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.950" end="00:17:44.140" style="s2">into politics and into sociology and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.800" end="00:17:46.150" style="s2">every goddamn thing it just tries to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.140" end="00:17:47.770" style="s2">measure everything but as we know when</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.150" end="00:17:50.050" style="s2">we get into that hyper measurement phase</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.770" end="00:17:51.850" style="s2">well that&#39;s where the Hermes character</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.050" end="00:17:54.370" style="s2">comes in every single time he always</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">pops back up whenever a society goes</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.370" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">hyper measurement like this</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:03.450" style="s2">so what is that you know what is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.350" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">what are the terms of that divorce you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.450" end="00:18:06.990" style="s2">know you take the kids I&#39;ll take the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:09.240" style="s2">money kind of situation</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.990" end="00:18:10.950" style="s2">this is business wint internets</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:14.279" style="s2">everybody&#39;s favorite shit poster on on</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.950" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">the Internet Wittgenstein is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.279" end="00:18:18.690" style="s2">Vienna circle people and they finally</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:19.980" style="s2">get around to measure stuff and maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.690" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">they just keep measuring better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.980" end="00:18:23.610" style="s2">gonna get bad at that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:25.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get better we I&#39;m at the point</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.610" end="00:18:26.789" style="s2">in my life as a programmer where every</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.320" end="00:18:28.169" style="s2">time I see your programming geek I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.789" end="00:18:30.299" style="s2">think I&#39;m building another stupid human</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.169" end="00:18:31.860" style="s2">trap it&#39;s that there is no progress I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.159" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">this point so you know what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.210" end="00:18:42.330" style="s2">with this what do we do when</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.590" style="s2">everything&#39;s measured and we are and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.330" end="00:18:44.850" style="s2">everything&#39;s predictable and if it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.590" end="00:18:47.009" style="s2">predictable we can just use the law to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.850" end="00:18:50.399" style="s2">make it more predictable how how how is</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s that you can&#39;t even do</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.429" end="00:18:56.450" style="s2">that&#39;s that that crazy black art</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.450" end="00:19:03.090" style="s2">it&#39;s the Revenge of metaphysics it turns</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.029" end="00:19:04.830" style="s2">out the AI the black box you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.090" end="00:19:06.119" style="s2">measure it you can measure the input in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.830" end="00:19:08.309" style="s2">the output you can&#39;t measure what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.119" end="00:19:10.740" style="s2">going on in it and those Neanderthal</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.309" end="00:19:12.629" style="s2">brains that chimeric cognition mmm not</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.740" end="00:19:15.419" style="s2">gonna measure that either so now we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.629" end="00:19:17.220" style="s2">this place where all of your rulers and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.419" end="00:19:19.190" style="s2">all of your tactics to measure and get</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.220" end="00:19:21.720" style="s2">this like you know fuck metaphysics oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.190" end="00:19:23.940" style="s2">this is a hard backstop this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.720" end="00:19:25.499" style="s2">a hard I pump the brakes for a second</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.940" end="00:19:27.179" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get the results</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.499" end="00:19:28.679" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for here in fact trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.179" end="00:19:30.659" style="s2">to measure it is mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.679" end="00:19:32.129" style="s2">impossible because of certain things</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.659" end="00:19:34.200" style="s2">like the vanishing gradient and other</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.129" end="00:19:36.269" style="s2">types of techniques so you get stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.200" end="00:19:39.929" style="s2">this like gaussian mess when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.269" end="00:19:41.850" style="s2">dealing with AI and black boxes and your</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.929" end="00:19:44.490" style="s2">techniques of statistics probability</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.850" end="00:19:47.340" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a heuristic of measurement</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.490" end="00:19:49.169" style="s2">for sure but when you have entire</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.340" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">markets being ran by these black boxes</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.169" end="00:19:55.139" style="s2">and voting elections and advertising and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:56.730" style="s2">everything ran by this I mean what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.139" end="00:19:59.009" style="s2">your sign is gonna do to that how can</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.730" end="00:20:00.149" style="s2">you possibly measure that you can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.009" end="00:20:02.879" style="s2">signs anymore you&#39;re gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.149" end="00:20:05.429" style="s2">cracking down on law and things get</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.879" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">messy so metaphysics is back and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.429" end="00:20:09.929" style="s2">ready for some blood and these two</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:11.750" style="s2">techniques are really are really gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.929" end="00:20:15.660" style="s2">knock it out the park</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.750" end="00:20:17.040" style="s2">so I said I had a anything about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.660" end="00:20:17.690" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.040" end="00:20:22.350" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.690" end="00:20:24.420" style="s2">so anybody&#39;s been to my site it&#39;s cult</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.350" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">state this is the background there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.420" end="00:20:27.810" style="s2">been the long time background of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">everything I&#39;ve done and it&#39;s been this</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.810" end="00:20:32.070" style="s2">equation and it&#39;s the Philosopher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:33.420" style="s2">Stone equation now yes I am trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.070" end="00:20:34.890" style="s2">build a philosopher&#39;s stone that is true</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.420" end="00:20:36.150" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the Philosopher&#39;s Stone you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.890" end="00:20:37.350" style="s2">think I don&#39;t care about letting go</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.150" end="00:20:41.250" style="s2">that&#39;s not what I&#39;m out that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.350" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do what&#39;s to end up</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.250" end="00:20:45.090" style="s2">happening is because of that mythology</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:47.400" style="s2">of the LEED Gold is actually this whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.090" end="00:20:49.380" style="s2">pursuit is typically fixated around the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.400" end="00:20:53.130" style="s2">quadrangle now what do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.380" end="00:20:55.410" style="s2">OOP wrong way so let&#39;s take the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.130" end="00:20:58.950" style="s2">part of this equation make of the man</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.410" end="00:21:02.010" style="s2">and woman human relations we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.950" end="00:21:03.570" style="s2">exclusively with humans first this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.010" end="00:21:05.940" style="s2">the first part of the out chemical</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.570" end="00:21:08.550" style="s2">equation so right off the bat we start</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.940" end="00:21:10.320" style="s2">with soul alchemy that&#39;s where we start</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.550" end="00:21:12.030" style="s2">we don&#39;t start with lead we don&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.320" end="00:21:15.510" style="s2">with atomic theory we don&#39;t even start</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.030" end="00:21:17.610" style="s2">with mathematics we start with people we</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.510" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">deal with human relations once we</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.610" end="00:21:21.450" style="s2">understand human relations how to poke</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:23.370" style="s2">and prod how to make a person do one how</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.450" end="00:21:26.580" style="s2">to make a person do the other thing then</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.370" end="00:21:30.690" style="s2">from there we can extract a circle and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.580" end="00:21:32.680" style="s2">what&#39;s the circle it&#39;s the economy so</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.690" end="00:21:34.030" style="s2">you&#39;re a bourse</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.680" end="00:21:35.680" style="s2">the whole purpose of an economy is they</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.030" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">have its circular where I put money into</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.680" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">it and then it rolls through the economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:41.380" style="s2">and then it comes back I issue credit to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:44.110" style="s2">you and then you issue it back to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.380" end="00:21:45.550" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a circular pump of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.110" end="00:21:46.930" style="s2">economics that&#39;s the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.550" end="00:21:48.970" style="s2">issuing credits the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.930" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">currency and keeping track of debts so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.970" end="00:21:56.220" style="s2">have to now take from human relations I</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:58.530" style="s2">have to trap them in a debt economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.220" end="00:22:00.540" style="s2">once I get that I had my hora Boris I</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.530" end="00:22:03.210" style="s2">have now figured out the next part of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.540" end="00:22:04.410" style="s2">soul equation my soul alchemy now this</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.210" end="00:22:06.060" style="s2">could be done in a variety of ways</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.410" end="00:22:08.040" style="s2">sometimes it can be done in a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.060" end="00:22:10.140" style="s2">brutish way which is basically slavery</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.040" end="00:22:11.760" style="s2">or it could be done in a you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.140" end="00:22:13.860" style="s2">your fault you fucked up kind of userís</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.760" end="00:22:15.210" style="s2">way so however you want to twist it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.860" end="00:22:17.160" style="s2">there&#39;s different techniques you can do</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.210" end="00:22:18.690" style="s2">to trap people in this circle but once</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.160" end="00:22:20.670" style="s2">you trap them in this circle now you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.690" end="00:22:22.860" style="s2">extract the next part of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.670" end="00:22:24.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s the Quadrangle it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.860" end="00:22:26.490" style="s2">mastery of the elements once I have</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.630" end="00:22:28.920" style="s2">humans and I&#39;m steering them through</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.490" end="00:22:30.210" style="s2">with the economy now I&#39;m saying okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.920" end="00:22:31.530" style="s2">gonna hire scientists here I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.210" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">hire babysitters here I&#39;m gonna hire</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.530" end="00:22:35.160" style="s2">guards here I&#39;m gonna have all these</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">people exploring nature to exploit</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.160" end="00:22:39.420" style="s2">nature better they&#39;re going to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:41.460" style="s2">to steer nature I&#39;m steering humans so</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.420" end="00:22:43.500" style="s2">they steer nature that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.460" end="00:22:45.090" style="s2">change so far now once I get real good</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.500" end="00:22:47.250" style="s2">at that I now have to master my</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.090" end="00:22:49.800" style="s2">distribution because if I just mine up</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.250" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">all the gold and and I give it to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.800" end="00:22:52.890" style="s2">everybody then the gold doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:55.110" style="s2">value I have to actually put a time</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.890" end="00:22:56.820" style="s2">delay in the in the and the gold moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.110" end="00:22:59.460" style="s2">from one place to the next otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.820" end="00:23:00.780" style="s2">it&#39;s just garbage so what do I do I need</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.460" end="00:23:03.540" style="s2">to control the distribution in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.780" end="00:23:06.300" style="s2">organization so a triangle is its order</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.540" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the order from the top down so now</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.300" end="00:23:10.710" style="s2">I have to master the distribution of all</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.420" style="s2">of the elements I&#39;m able to extract from</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.710" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">the planet and from each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.420" end="00:23:16.740" style="s2">have to do that in either royalty or</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:18.690" style="s2">democracy or pick you you know pick your</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.740" end="00:23:21.150" style="s2">flavor of the week and once I have that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.690" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">I can now extract the final circle which</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.150" end="00:23:25.620" style="s2">is the firmament which is the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">the universe I can use that pyramid to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.620" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">touch the heavens</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the Philosopher&#39;s Stone</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:35.450" style="s2">actually is I think I might be wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:37.130" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.450" end="00:23:39.260" style="s2">turns out that this has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.130" end="00:23:42.860" style="s2">with LED to go led to gold this is about</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.260" end="00:23:45.530" style="s2">turning us from our default state of</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.530" end="00:23:50.090" style="s2">organised species that can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:52.070" style="s2">some pretty amazing shit typically at</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.070" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a price for everything so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.140" end="00:24:00.440" style="s2">turns out that the we are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:02.270" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone humans are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.440" end="00:24:03.890" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone how you organize us</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.270" end="00:24:05.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the Philosopher&#39;s Stone that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.890" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">why it&#39;s on the back here one dollar</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.150" end="00:24:10.070" style="s2">bill and it&#39;s an equation of how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:12.860" style="s2">assemble a civilization from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.070" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">just give me a man and a woman I got it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.860" end="00:24:16.520" style="s2">from there I don&#39;t need anything else so</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:19.670" style="s2">it&#39;s the ultimate leverage point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.520" end="00:24:21.320" style="s2">the ultimate Archimedean fulcrum and all</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.670" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">I need is just two humans and I could do</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.320" end="00:24:25.390" style="s2">it I could build this entire thing from</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.100" end="00:24:32.570" style="s2">so this brings back the idea of instead</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.570" end="00:24:37.309" style="s2">the black box arts because that&#39;s what a</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.809" end="00:24:39.170" style="s2">eyes are the black boxes you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.309" end="00:24:40.700" style="s2">what&#39;s going on oh so we&#39;re gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.170" end="00:24:42.140" style="s2">with the alchemical atom just like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.700" end="00:24:43.670" style="s2">equation said start with a man and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.140" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">woman we&#39;re gonna start with humans</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.670" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where that&#39;s where that starts</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:49.280" style="s2">that&#39;s where I&#39;m starting so right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:50.750" style="s2">we&#39;re trapped in the ultra measurement</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.280" end="00:24:52.160" style="s2">phase of science which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.750" end="00:24:54.290" style="s2">saying everything can be turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.160" end="00:24:55.730" style="s2">math function and I don&#39;t need the rest</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.290" end="00:24:57.590" style="s2">of the body I just need focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.730" end="00:24:58.760" style="s2">brain I can do psycho technology all day</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.590" end="00:25:01.960" style="s2">long and not include the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.760" end="00:25:04.130" style="s2">body and all this other you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.960" end="00:25:06.290" style="s2">impressive prestidigitation we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.130" end="00:25:08.690" style="s2">involved ourselves with but this is just</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.290" end="00:25:10.340" style="s2">wrong this is not correct because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.690" end="00:25:12.170" style="s2">starting to see these problems we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.340" end="00:25:14.660" style="s2">we can&#39;t translate this to approach to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.170" end="00:25:16.490" style="s2">AI we can&#39;t translate this approach to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.660" end="00:25:17.900" style="s2">my Neanderthal brains chimeric brains</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.490" end="00:25:18.860" style="s2">you just can&#39;t do them at all you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.900" end="00:25:21.470" style="s2">to use something else entirely</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.860" end="00:25:23.570" style="s2">so let&#39;s just let&#39;s let&#39;s give the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.470" end="00:25:24.920" style="s2">scientists their their reward and say</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.570" end="00:25:26.870" style="s2">thank you for all the help but you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.920" end="00:25:28.429" style="s2">sit this one out for a bit so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.870" end="00:25:30.950" style="s2">gonna say thank you move on little</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.429" end="00:25:34.250" style="s2">scientist guy let&#39;s treat humans as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.950" end="00:25:36.890" style="s2">black box let&#39;s not make assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.250" end="00:25:40.070" style="s2">about the black box let&#39;s just say I put</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.890" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">things into the person which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.070" end="00:25:43.559" style="s2">be energy and matter and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.900" style="s2">going to be a behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.559" end="00:25:47.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t need to know what you are I</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.900" end="00:25:49.020" style="s2">don&#39;t need to know your cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.670" end="00:25:50.809" style="s2">background and all these other things I</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.020" end="00:25:53.100" style="s2">may be able to extrapolate that or</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.809" end="00:25:55.320" style="s2">categorize it at some other point but</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.100" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">those are just optimizations down the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.320" end="00:25:59.250" style="s2">line let&#39;s just start with the basics</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:01.740" style="s2">here oh and because entropy is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.250" end="00:26:06.160" style="s2">we have to account for waste as well not</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.740" end="00:26:09.700" style="s2">all input in a human becomes behavior</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.160" end="00:26:14.130" style="s2">so what&#39;s the waste turns out I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.700" end="00:26:14.130" style="s2">the waste is ideas and symbols</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.290" end="00:26:19.700" style="s2">so you get all your input your energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:21.680" style="s2">and your matter and what is relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.700" end="00:26:24.260" style="s2">immediate becomes behavior but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.680" end="00:26:26.150" style="s2">not just packing in my brain it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.260" end="00:26:28.370" style="s2">idea it&#39;s a thought I&#39;ll get around to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.150" end="00:26:31.790" style="s2">it is heat waste it&#39;s the way this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.370" end="00:26:33.230" style="s2">this is the heat sink of our input it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.790" end="00:26:35.330" style="s2">not just a driver of behavior it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:38.300" style="s2">and they they live here in the same page</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.330" end="00:26:41.180" style="s2">at the same space so let&#39;s let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.300" end="00:26:45.070" style="s2">with this concept of looking at humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.180" end="00:26:48.560" style="s2">the black box human the black box Arts</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.070" end="00:26:50.510" style="s2">let&#39;s make transmutation chains of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.560" end="00:26:53.450" style="s2">humans where the output of one human is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.510" end="00:26:56.690" style="s2">the input of another start with a mother</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.450" end="00:26:59.330" style="s2">give him a mouse come on come on mr.</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.690" end="00:27:01.610" style="s2">Mouse oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.330" end="00:27:04.350" style="s2">start with the mother the output of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.610" end="00:27:06.030" style="s2">mother is the input of the hunter</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.350" end="00:27:09.450" style="s2">so either could be the mother&#39;s love the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.030" end="00:27:10.950" style="s2">mother&#39;s care the mothers attendance the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.450" end="00:27:14.370" style="s2">child becomes a hunter the output of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.950" end="00:27:15.990" style="s2">hunter stabilizes the tribe because</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.370" end="00:27:18.539" style="s2">they&#39;re getting food which allows for</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.990" end="00:27:20.309" style="s2">farming output of the farmer goes to</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.539" end="00:27:21.750" style="s2">herbalism and once you get all these</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.309" end="00:27:22.860" style="s2">things you can now make Weaver&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.750" end="00:27:24.660" style="s2">then from there you have a leader to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.860" end="00:27:26.130" style="s2">backtrack all these things but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.660" end="00:27:30.630" style="s2">all stairs also waste</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.130" end="00:27:32.669" style="s2">there&#39;s also waste ideas and symbols the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.630" end="00:27:34.910" style="s2">waste goes to the shaman becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.669" end="00:27:37.190" style="s2">input of the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.910" end="00:27:38.930" style="s2">now the output of both of these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.190" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">when you transmute them together open up</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.930" end="00:27:43.100" style="s2">a totally new transportation chain where</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:44.540" style="s2">you can now have miners because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.100" end="00:27:46.190" style="s2">shaman and the leader are working</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.540" end="00:27:48.860" style="s2">together to organize people to do some</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.190" end="00:27:50.420" style="s2">really hard labor and mining is fuckin</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.860" end="00:27:52.730" style="s2">hard labor when it comes to the Bronze</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.420" end="00:27:54.380" style="s2">Age you&#39;re swinging hammers you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.730" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">swinging you don&#39;t even have good tools</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.380" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">you&#39;re like you&#39;re buck naked and a mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:27:59.900" style="s2">just like kicking rocks and shit like</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:01.700" style="s2">it&#39;s hard work how do you get people</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.900" end="00:28:03.710" style="s2">there well you need you know you need</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.700" end="00:28:05.870" style="s2">these two people to do it so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.710" end="00:28:07.610" style="s2">actually need the you need to recycle</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.870" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">the waste of this part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.610" end="00:28:13.160" style="s2">transmutation chain into a shaman so</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:14.510" style="s2">then you get your miners on the output</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.160" end="00:28:16.370" style="s2">of the mine are obviously blacksmith to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.510" end="00:28:18.230" style="s2">the toolmaker soldiers then that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.370" end="00:28:19.700" style="s2">produces the output of slaves you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.230" end="00:28:21.380" style="s2">get builders from there from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.700" end="00:28:23.090" style="s2">builders you now have secure places to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.380" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">do coin minting and from coin minting</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.090" end="00:28:27.020" style="s2">you get merchants so this whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.740" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">transmutation chain goes into place but</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.020" end="00:28:31.790" style="s2">again the waste has to be accounted for</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">the waste of the shaman and the waste of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.790" end="00:28:35.030" style="s2">the metal workers becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:37.610" style="s2">mathematician now how is that possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.030" end="00:28:39.110" style="s2">well because the mathematician has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.610" end="00:28:40.490" style="s2">keep track of the logistics which are</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.110" end="00:28:41.810" style="s2">very complicated expensive and heavy</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.490" end="00:28:44.150" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.810" end="00:28:46.190" style="s2">and they also have to keep track of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.150" end="00:28:47.300" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to find the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.190" end="00:28:49.220" style="s2">between all these numbers that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.300" end="00:28:51.140" style="s2">keeping track of so they need both of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.220" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">them and the waste of both of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.140" end="00:28:54.020" style="s2">allow from applications that come into</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:56.600" style="s2">play that&#39;s how math got started was</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.020" end="00:28:59.780" style="s2">keeping count of stuff it didn&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.600" end="00:29:01.250" style="s2">because you know I wanted to troll</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.780" end="00:29:03.970" style="s2">people on the internet with a funny math</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.250" end="00:29:06.500" style="s2">meme it&#39;s it was practical</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.970" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">so then output of the merchant becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.500" end="00:29:09.860" style="s2">linguist because they are keeping track</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:11.090" style="s2">of contracts and they&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.860" end="00:29:13.310" style="s2">trade and they&#39;re trying to sell their</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.090" end="00:29:14.570" style="s2">wares and and language is the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.310" end="00:29:16.670" style="s2">way to really convey those type of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.570" end="00:29:18.620" style="s2">things but you merge the mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.670" end="00:29:20.780" style="s2">with the linguist you get a banker so</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.620" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">from that from the mother I can get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.780" end="00:29:26.450" style="s2">banker that&#39;s my entire transmutation</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:29.900" style="s2">chain right so I&#39;ve assembled the humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.450" end="00:29:31.940" style="s2">in a way to manipulate nature each one</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.900" end="00:29:34.610" style="s2">of these people is manipulating the mat</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.940" end="00:29:36.920" style="s2">is is demonstrating a mastery of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.610" end="00:29:39.410" style="s2">elements to build a transportation chain</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.920" end="00:29:41.810" style="s2">which allows me to make my pyramid so</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.410" end="00:29:44.500" style="s2">now I have my transportation chain and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.810" end="00:29:46.730" style="s2">this is where people start fucking it up</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.500" end="00:29:48.380" style="s2">because once you have these chains in to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.730" end="00:29:50.530" style="s2">play this is where the storytellers come</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.380" end="00:29:52.370" style="s2">in sometimes the storytellers are useful</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.530" end="00:29:55.000" style="s2">most of the time they&#39;re a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.370" end="00:29:57.410" style="s2">assholes now why is that the case</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.000" end="00:29:59.150" style="s2">because they do what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.410" end="00:30:01.580" style="s2">abracadabra which literally translates</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.150" end="00:30:04.670" style="s2">to I I will create as I speak that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.580" end="00:30:07.040" style="s2">what it means so I can whisper at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.670" end="00:30:09.350" style="s2">beginning of this chain and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.040" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">moves through the transportation chain</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.350" end="00:30:13.550" style="s2">and as I put my idea through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:15.470" style="s2">transportation chain the transmutation</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.550" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">chain changes its behavior changes its</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.470" end="00:30:18.590" style="s2">output so from a whisper to the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:22.370" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.590" end="00:30:24.770" style="s2">I can move geopolitical chess from just</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.370" end="00:30:27.560" style="s2">a couple well-placed words if I get it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.770" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">right storytellers eventually start to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.560" end="00:30:31.610" style="s2">see that they say if I talk to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:33.560" style="s2">person I get these results and now this</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.610" end="00:30:35.180" style="s2">becomes less important you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.560" end="00:30:36.500" style="s2">innovate in this space anymore you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.180" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">have to take care of your transportation</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.500" end="00:30:40.730" style="s2">chains and attend to their needs</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:42.590" style="s2">you just need them to hold their place</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.730" end="00:30:44.390" style="s2">because you need the app you need the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.590" end="00:30:45.710" style="s2">abracadabra to work you need that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.390" end="00:30:47.420" style="s2">need two mythologies and the stories</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.710" end="00:30:49.220" style="s2">that work more than the actual medium in</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.420" end="00:30:50.540" style="s2">which the stories are passing through so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.220" end="00:30:52.180" style="s2">now you&#39;re flipping your priority and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.540" end="00:30:53.300" style="s2">this tends to piss these people off</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.180" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">understandably</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.300" end="00:31:03.400" style="s2">and of course intends empower these</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:05.380" style="s2">okay so what happens uh yes his back he</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.400" end="00:31:05.860" style="s2">has opinions - he says science can help</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.380" end="00:31:08.410" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.860" end="00:31:10.990" style="s2">he&#39;s right probably could so had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.410" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">science help well let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.990" end="00:31:17.410" style="s2">it it does chimeric transmutation chains</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:19.090" style="s2">and what do i mean by that well the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.410" end="00:31:21.310" style="s2">scientist comes in and says well I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.090" end="00:31:23.750" style="s2">make this thing called a computer and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.310" end="00:31:25.610" style="s2">can replace these people</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.750" end="00:31:27.230" style="s2">now I didn&#39;t remove them from the chain</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.610" end="00:31:29.000" style="s2">I didn&#39;t remove their function from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.230" end="00:31:30.940" style="s2">transportation chain it&#39;s still there</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.000" end="00:31:34.340" style="s2">it&#39;s just not a human anymore</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.940" end="00:31:36.919" style="s2">okay so then another scientist comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.340" end="00:31:39.259" style="s2">along and says oh well I can use replace</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.919" end="00:31:40.669" style="s2">these people with robots okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.259" end="00:31:42.230" style="s2">probably true you probably want soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.669" end="00:31:44.210" style="s2">and builders and farmers to be robots</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.230" end="00:31:46.279" style="s2">that&#39;s probably efficient you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.210" end="00:31:48.110" style="s2">iterating towards this efficiency you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.279" end="00:31:50.269" style="s2">justifying it it&#39;s good it&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.110" end="00:31:52.879" style="s2">great then someone like me comes along</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.269" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">says you know brains of our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.879" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">boo plop them in there now they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:59.210" style="s2">stuff now all of a sudden you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">getting the transportation effect of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.210" end="00:32:04.309" style="s2">chain and the scientist is happy</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">scientist is happy that you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.309" end="00:32:08.539" style="s2">able to get the same effect and ideally</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:09.860" style="s2">even better so you&#39;re you&#39;re reducing</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.539" end="00:32:11.389" style="s2">the input needs and you&#39;re increasing</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.860" end="00:32:16.490" style="s2">the outputs you&#39;re getting that progress</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.389" end="00:32:19.929" style="s2">at efficiency but at the same time well</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.490" end="00:32:19.929" style="s2">you&#39;re storytellers don&#39;t work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.250" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">because originally all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.900" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">transportation chains were human but</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:28.680" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in this chain where I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:30.690" style="s2">can inject myself my story passes</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.680" end="00:32:32.100" style="s2">through the whole chain anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.690" end="00:32:33.030" style="s2">of other brain won&#39;t get it a robot</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.100" end="00:32:35.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.030" end="00:32:36.900" style="s2">shamans don&#39;t get it so abracadabra is</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.010" end="00:32:38.700" style="s2">gone there&#39;s no more magic it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.900" end="00:32:40.260" style="s2">no more of this of this hacking of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.700" end="00:32:42.840" style="s2">system you now have to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.260" end="00:32:44.970" style="s2">transmutation chains themselves that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.840" end="00:32:47.160" style="s2">bit of a challenge because then these</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.970" end="00:32:48.930" style="s2">guys get real mad cuz that&#39;s how they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.160" end="00:32:51.570" style="s2">been running society anyway is these</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.930" end="00:32:53.850" style="s2">storytellers the fucking nerds ruin the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.570" end="00:32:55.650" style="s2">game I mean what is what is the you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.850" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">what is the mythology of Russia</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.650" end="00:32:59.040" style="s2">interfering with the elections right</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">well those Russian BOTS there&#39;s Russian</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.040" end="00:33:01.800" style="s2">BOTS doing these things you put someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">in the transportation chain it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.800" end="00:33:08.820" style="s2">human so their narrative stories busted</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:11.090" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work anymore so this means</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.820" end="00:33:12.330" style="s2">our monopoly on sentience is over</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.090" end="00:33:14.550" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.330" end="00:33:17.010" style="s2">because all of our assumptions about how</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.550" end="00:33:18.510" style="s2">society should run and what laws we</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.010" end="00:33:20.970" style="s2">should have and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.510" end="00:33:23.910" style="s2">we&#39;re totally based upon Homo Sapien</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.970" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">cognition monopoly and now we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.910" end="00:33:28.860" style="s2">Gaussian computation and chimera</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">computation in the mix now so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.860" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">gone and the measurement boys are having</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:36.270" style="s2">problems with that they&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:38.520" style="s2">Cass Sunstein nudge stuff to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.270" end="00:33:40.110" style="s2">figure out where they can where they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.520" end="00:33:43.320" style="s2">make their uh where they can get their</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.110" end="00:33:45.390" style="s2">stories through but it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.320" end="00:33:46.800" style="s2">not getting the gains it used to be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.390" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">not having the effect that used to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.800" end="00:33:50.970" style="s2">but this is where that hermès character</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.860" style="s2">comes in once again even in the even in</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.970" end="00:33:54.810" style="s2">these jaws of defeat this hopelessness</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.860" end="00:33:56.460" style="s2">that it looks like there&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.810" end="00:33:59.610" style="s2">interpretation here in which alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.460" end="00:34:04.429" style="s2">comes raging to the front again and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.610" end="00:34:05.970" style="s2">very simple that&#39;s the new black box</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.429" end="00:34:10.740" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.970" end="00:34:12.540" style="s2">that&#39;s it so the input is noise the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.740" end="00:34:14.050" style="s2">output is knowledge and the waste is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.540" end="00:34:18.660" style="s2">symbols</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.050" end="00:34:20.530" style="s2">so now he&#39;s back and now we&#39;re here and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.660" end="00:34:23.980" style="s2">this is why you want to use alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.530" end="00:34:25.929" style="s2">because science is done it&#39;s not done</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.980" end="00:34:28.420" style="s2">because it&#39;s not that I&#39;m pretty and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.929" end="00:34:30.429" style="s2">that I&#39;m anti science per se I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.420" end="00:34:31.780" style="s2">like I know when things are dead and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.429" end="00:34:33.850" style="s2">know when things are just extending</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.780" end="00:34:35.650" style="s2">their life unnecessarily and science is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.850" end="00:34:38.020" style="s2">Western science in particular is doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.650" end="00:34:40.900" style="s2">that right now so when you when you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.020" end="00:34:42.310" style="s2">these types of things in play you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.900" end="00:34:44.500" style="s2">going to need alchemy to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.310" end="00:34:46.300" style="s2">it once again it&#39;s back and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.500" end="00:34:48.910" style="s2">very important to learn to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.300" end="00:34:50.440" style="s2">world in this way just as a technique</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.910" end="00:34:53.530" style="s2">not necessarily as a reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.440" end="00:34:55.570" style="s2">methodology we&#39;re not even going towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.530" end="00:34:57.550" style="s2">reproducibility anymore there are a eyes</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.570" end="00:34:59.410" style="s2">that come into being which find some</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.550" end="00:35:05.140" style="s2">correlation and then people depend upon</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.410" end="00:35:07.030" style="s2">that correlation holding so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.140" end="00:35:08.620" style="s2">trying to homogenize everything into an</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.030" end="00:35:11.290" style="s2">explainable fashion that&#39;s just long</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.620" end="00:35:15.790" style="s2">gone so blue church isn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.290" end="00:35:17.530" style="s2">sorry but you know that&#39;s life and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.790" end="00:35:18.610" style="s2">the other benefit of looking at alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.530" end="00:35:21.360" style="s2">here and I think that&#39;s the end of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.610" end="00:35:24.930" style="s2">presentation but there&#39;s one more point</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.360" end="00:35:27.640" style="s2">if my mouse worked how frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.930" end="00:35:31.270" style="s2">the other point here is that in addition</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.640" end="00:35:33.700" style="s2">to alchemy doing these things allowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.270" end="00:35:35.710" style="s2">you to make sense of what you otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.700" end="00:35:37.330" style="s2">could not make sense of and that&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.710" end="00:35:39.270" style="s2">away here because the future is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.330" end="00:35:41.980" style="s2">full of things you can&#39;t make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.270" end="00:35:44.110" style="s2">alchemy is also a fantastic collection</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.980" end="00:35:46.180" style="s2">of different epistemologies throughout</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.110" end="00:35:48.010" style="s2">time you have different cultures</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.180" end="00:35:50.260" style="s2">different interpretations of how people</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.010" end="00:35:54.070" style="s2">made sense of the unknown that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.260" end="00:35:56.500" style="s2">valuable material to go over when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.070" end="00:35:59.230" style="s2">doing sense making operations and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.500" end="00:36:01.210" style="s2">training in that type of thing so I hope</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.230" end="00:36:03.490" style="s2">that gives some clarity as to why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.210" end="00:36:05.860" style="s2">focused on alchemy so much and why I</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.490" end="00:36:08.260" style="s2">made so much reference to it and then in</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.860" end="00:36:11.620" style="s2">the second video or the second version a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.260" end="00:36:13.930" style="s2">second video this season and why you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.620" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">know the idea of like copper being the</p>

<p begin="00:36:18.850" end="00:36:22.150" style="s2">meaning what what were they what were</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.890" end="00:36:25.330" style="s2">they using you might as well think of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.150" end="00:36:27.700" style="s2">antiquity cognition not as superstition</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.330" end="00:36:29.950" style="s2">just think of it like like one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.700" end="00:36:31.660" style="s2">ancestors brains came up with it you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:33.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t dismiss it outright just treat</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.660" end="00:36:36.220" style="s2">the past like another culture cuz it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.640" end="00:36:38.410" style="s2">so I wouldn&#39;t just outright dismiss like</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.220" end="00:36:40.660" style="s2">Japanese thinking cuz I don&#39;t like rice</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.410" end="00:36:42.460" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t do that I wouldn&#39;t dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.660" end="00:36:44.410" style="s2">Bronze Age thinking just because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.460" end="00:36:46.510" style="s2">thought it was superstitious there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.410" end="00:36:49.180" style="s2">some valuable stuff there and we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.510" end="00:36:50.859" style="s2">the tools to mine it now you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.180" end="00:36:52.599" style="s2">to sit there and just shun it be like oh</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.220" end="00:36:57.070" style="s2">have to do that anymore I have AI</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.570" end="00:36:59.099" style="s2">systems that will literally parse these</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.070" end="00:37:03.130" style="s2">ancient texts so stop being fucking lazy</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.099" end="00:37:16.810" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s all thanks let me under</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.079" end="00:37:30.250" style="s2">before we get into Q&amp;A by asking some</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.970" end="00:37:32.980" style="s2">clarification questions and so everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.250" end="00:37:34.900" style="s2">else feel free to write your questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.980" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">in the chat and then I can point to you</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">can ask me to ask them for you but</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.010" end="00:37:43.869" style="s2">before we get into that maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:45.640" style="s2">because I&#39;m more inebriated than usual</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.869" end="00:37:50.349" style="s2">today but a couple things I didn&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.640" end="00:37:53.470" style="s2">follow so this story teller is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.349" end="00:37:54.520" style="s2">storyteller the alchemist or is that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.470" end="00:37:58.359" style="s2">the alchemist something more than the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.520" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">storyteller yeah they&#39;re so another part</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.359" end="00:38:01.569" style="s2">of soul alchemy is storytelling because</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:03.640" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re affecting</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.569" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">the transmutation chains so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.640" end="00:38:07.300" style="s2">the person who built the transportation</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:09.010" style="s2">teams that&#39;s an alchemist the person who</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.300" end="00:38:10.540" style="s2">maintains them as an alchemist and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.010" end="00:38:14.650" style="s2">person who&#39;s hacking them is also an</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.540" end="00:38:17.579" style="s2">alchemist right and when you say use</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.650" end="00:38:22.359" style="s2">alchemy or or be be aware of it or</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.579" end="00:38:25.300" style="s2">recognize it is basically the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.359" end="00:38:28.540" style="s2">tool the slide where you had all those</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.300" end="00:38:34.180" style="s2">symbols like the Quadrangle the the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.540" end="00:38:35.260" style="s2">hierarchy and the elements okay one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.180" end="00:38:38.260" style="s2">the things that I kept thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.260" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">throughout this presentation was whether</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.260" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">or not this relates to Carl Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:46.590" style="s2">an excavation of alchemy and whether or</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:49.450" style="s2">not you have any knowledge of that Oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.590" end="00:38:53.080" style="s2">Carl Jung is my safe word</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.450" end="00:38:55.360" style="s2">he&#39;s uh he&#39;s I&#39;m a little bit jaded on</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.080" end="00:38:59.800" style="s2">Carl Jung and it&#39;s it&#39;s for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.360" end="00:39:02.710" style="s2">stupidest reason imaginable they he he I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.800" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">should say he he is there was a part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.710" end="00:39:07.000" style="s2">hot there&#39;s this weird part of Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:09.580" style="s2">that warships Carl Jung like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.000" end="00:39:11.080" style="s2">fucking weirdest thing they they worship</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.580" end="00:39:13.210" style="s2">the shit out of them and there are like</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.080" end="00:39:15.610" style="s2">entire armies of like sycophants and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.210" end="00:39:17.260" style="s2">fans just like if you don&#39;t if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.610" end="00:39:19.570" style="s2">say the right thing about Carl Jung then</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.260" end="00:39:21.610" style="s2">oh my god they&#39;ll just slap the shit out</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.570" end="00:39:24.040" style="s2">of you and I&#39;ve had knock-down drag-out</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.610" end="00:39:25.600" style="s2">fights with them about this type of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.040" end="00:39:28.450" style="s2">stuff and they didn&#39;t like any of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.600" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">because I think that this tends to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.450" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">happen someone actually has a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:34.390" style="s2">good breakthrough and other people it</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:37.060" style="s2">attracts people who try to use that</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.390" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">understanding and then because they</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.060" end="00:39:40.840" style="s2">aren&#39;t Carl Jung they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.430" style="s2">understand the breakthrough as well as</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.840" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">he did so they&#39;re just kind of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.430" end="00:39:47.740" style="s2">kind of parroting it mimicking it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">they don&#39;t know why anymore so it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.740" end="00:39:52.570" style="s2">experience has been full of those people</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.770" end="00:39:54.250" style="s2">but I know that that Jung and Freud work</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.570" end="00:39:56.770" style="s2">together pretty extensively and they had</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.250" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">a significant spiritual falling-out</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.770" end="00:40:05.530" style="s2">between the tool going in two different</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:08.230" style="s2">directions so I mean like I said I</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.530" end="00:40:09.940" style="s2">prefaced my interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.230" end="00:40:11.890" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s Stone I said that this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.940" end="00:40:14.710" style="s2">my particular interpretation it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.890" end="00:40:16.660" style="s2">deep with a capital T interpretation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.710" end="00:40:18.520" style="s2">I&#39;m sure mr. Young&#39;s interpretation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.660" end="00:40:20.230" style="s2">his as well so that&#39;s that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.520" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">of alchemy there&#39;s no methodological way</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.230" end="00:40:29.380" style="s2">of proving what&#39;s right or wrong that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:33.610" style="s2">kind of the confusing part - all right</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.380" end="00:40:36.220" style="s2">we got a question from Peter Lindberg so</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.610" end="00:40:38.170" style="s2">is there any modern alchemists or</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.220" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">thinkers or intellectuals that are into</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.170" end="00:40:43.630" style="s2">alchemy that you respect her would</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:45.700" style="s2">recommend this one I don&#39;t respect him</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.630" end="00:40:48.070" style="s2">but I respect his mastery of alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.700" end="00:40:51.220" style="s2">that&#39;s George Soros that guy knows what</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.070" end="00:40:54.130" style="s2">the fuck he&#39;s doing that guy knows his</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.220" end="00:40:56.079" style="s2">craft he&#39;s full</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.130" end="00:40:57.849" style="s2">that is a person who is spent considers</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:40:59.799" style="s2">a student of Karl Popper most people</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.849" end="00:41:03.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know that right so like Soros is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.799" end="00:41:05.349" style="s2">student of Karl Popper and even wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.220" end="00:41:07.450" style="s2">book called financial alchemy you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.349" end="00:41:09.220" style="s2">he&#39;s into that now whether he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.450" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">self identifies as one or not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.220" end="00:41:15.369" style="s2">know but when it comes to like modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:17.190" style="s2">techniques of how you do alchemy in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.369" end="00:41:21.670" style="s2">post-industrial and the Information Age</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.190" end="00:41:23.230" style="s2">he&#39;s pioneered quite a few of them so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.670" end="00:41:24.309" style="s2">tip my hat to understanding that even</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.230" end="00:41:28.809" style="s2">though I don&#39;t like what he&#39;s doing with</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.309" end="00:41:31.000" style="s2">the transmutation chains but uh he&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.809" end="00:41:34.029" style="s2">that is one skilled motherfucker for</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.000" end="00:41:40.150" style="s2">sure in terms of you know not big bad</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.029" end="00:41:42.220" style="s2">boogeyman of globalism I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.150" end="00:41:44.019" style="s2">competent storytellers that happen on</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.220" end="00:41:45.759" style="s2">the internet right now there&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.019" end="00:41:47.529" style="s2">not necessarily one person as much as</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.759" end="00:41:49.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a collective there&#39;s there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.529" end="00:41:51.099" style="s2">groups like this for example they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.210" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">learning how to be Alchemist without</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.099" end="00:41:54.549" style="s2">even knowing it surprisingly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:56.170" style="s2">trying to make sense of the stories the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.549" end="00:41:58.089" style="s2">organism of the storytelling that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.170" end="00:41:59.559" style="s2">going on and then there&#39;s a story</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.089" end="00:42:01.450" style="s2">tellers that are constantly outwitting</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.559" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">them I think that&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.450" end="00:42:07.049" style="s2">cat-and-mouse game so there might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:10.750" style="s2">some alchemy there too who knows</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.049" end="00:42:13.630" style="s2">we&#39;re to measure the effectiveness or</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.750" end="00:42:15.730" style="s2">the success of a story what are some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.630" end="00:42:17.380" style="s2">your roots that you look for other than</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.730" end="00:42:19.450" style="s2">its ability to propagate across the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.380" end="00:42:21.849" style="s2">chain yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.450" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">the ability to represent all three of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.849" end="00:42:26.380" style="s2">those cognitive techniques</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:28.990" style="s2">so the chimeric the Gaussian and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.380" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">human one so if anything can actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.990" end="00:42:39.250" style="s2">speak to all three that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:41.140" style="s2">the alchemists of the future if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.250" end="00:42:43.269" style="s2">any archetypical character that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.140" end="00:42:47.319" style="s2">frees people from this hell that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.269" end="00:42:50.230" style="s2">describing we kind of kind of talked</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.319" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">about that at the last episode of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.230" end="00:42:55.150" style="s2">first season regarding how you bring</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:57.519" style="s2">Girardi and sacrifice into the AI</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.150" end="00:43:00.190" style="s2">conflict space so that&#39;s that&#39;s one way</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.519" end="00:43:03.690" style="s2">that can temporarily mitigate the hell</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.190" end="00:43:06.609" style="s2">we&#39;re in right now can a human do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.690" end="00:43:07.750" style="s2">probably not but maybe I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.609" end="00:43:11.310" style="s2">lot of high hopes</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.750" end="00:43:13.570" style="s2">humans maybe I&#39;m a bit jaded but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.310" end="00:43:15.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve personally given up that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.570" end="00:43:17.670" style="s2">searched a long time ago so I might not</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.430" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">be the right person to ask on that one</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.670" end="00:43:23.890" style="s2">just to give people more chances to ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:25.980" style="s2">questions in the chat I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.890" end="00:43:30.340" style="s2">keep going here</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.980" end="00:43:35.230" style="s2">remember those now yeah so somebody had</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.340" end="00:43:37.000" style="s2">a nice meta comment that your or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.230" end="00:43:40.090" style="s2">telling us a story right now right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.000" end="00:43:41.620" style="s2">that&#39;s right is is basically our only</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.090" end="00:43:44.320" style="s2">hope like let&#39;s say we buy into this</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.620" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">frame is the only hope that we get</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.320" end="00:43:50.350" style="s2">better and better stories hmm there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:52.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a point of diminishing how would</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.350" end="00:43:55.120" style="s2">you define better there&#39;s a diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.660" end="00:43:57.400" style="s2">return on stories so at first you do</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.120" end="00:43:59.050" style="s2">need the stories to direct the waste the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.400" end="00:44:01.360" style="s2">output the symbols and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.050" end="00:44:04.090" style="s2">you need stories to kind of like launder</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.360" end="00:44:05.260" style="s2">the waste of people&#39;s minds all those</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.090" end="00:44:07.180" style="s2">symbols and ideas that are in there the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.260" end="00:44:10.270" style="s2">stories are good like being trash &#39;men</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.180" end="00:44:12.280" style="s2">of ideas it&#39;s a necessary function</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.270" end="00:44:17.230" style="s2">garbage collection is really important</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.280" end="00:44:19.120" style="s2">but the eventually once you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.230" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">abracadabra techniques once you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.120" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">to whisper at one part of the chain and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:24.520" style="s2">you can mutate the entire chain power</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:27.160" style="s2">conquer gets around that and abuses go</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.520" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">nuts and the storytellers do not give up</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.160" end="00:44:30.010" style="s2">their throne easily because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:32.350" style="s2">have any other skills they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.010" end="00:44:34.360" style="s2">actually craftsmen or you know people</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.350" end="00:44:35.950" style="s2">who build stuff that people want they</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.360" end="00:44:37.090" style="s2">just they just steer a narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.950" end="00:44:38.440" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that fight today they do</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.090" end="00:44:39.340" style="s2">not want to give up that power by any</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.440" end="00:44:43.360" style="s2">means necessary</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.340" end="00:44:45.160" style="s2">so on one hand storytelling is essential</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.360" end="00:44:47.620" style="s2">and on the other hand it can ruin</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.160" end="00:44:50.590" style="s2">civilizations if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a point of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.620" end="00:44:53.470" style="s2">contention even Plato I think was Plato</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.590" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">Socrates or Plato as Plato he said</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.470" end="00:44:58.150" style="s2">storytellers rule Society he didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:44:59.890" style="s2">mathematicians or scientists he said</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.150" end="00:45:03.580" style="s2">fucking storytellers rule society and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.890" end="00:45:05.080" style="s2">he&#39;s right so there&#39;s is there a good</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.580" end="00:45:07.000" style="s2">story is there a better story I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.080" end="00:45:08.590" style="s2">know but I know there&#39;s a cycle where</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.000" end="00:45:10.660" style="s2">you need stories to get the trains you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.590" end="00:45:12.280" style="s2">changed and chains started and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.660" end="00:45:13.420" style="s2">storytellers come along and then abuse</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.280" end="00:45:15.720" style="s2">the shit out of them and then around</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.420" end="00:45:15.720" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.380" end="00:45:22.350" style="s2">and abroad do you have a question you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.990" end="00:45:22.350" style="s2">like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.980" end="00:45:35.500" style="s2">he&#39;s a tease don&#39;t mind him alright</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.359" end="00:45:38.589" style="s2">mimetic caper I think he had a question</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.500" end="00:45:40.630" style="s2">earlier about the philosopher&#39;s stone</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.589" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">equation if you like to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.630" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">and ask that</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.360" end="00:45:53.420" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.819" end="00:45:55.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.770" end="00:46:06.170" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.950" end="00:46:15.980" style="s2">I gotta let you guys in meet yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.170" end="00:46:17.779" style="s2">it&#39;s our bad so in your version of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.980" end="00:46:19.880" style="s2">philosopher&#39;s stone equation do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.779" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">consider the four elements to be purely</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.880" end="00:46:24.230" style="s2">physical because there are very various</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:27.980" style="s2">symbolic meanings to the four elements</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.230" end="00:46:31.069" style="s2">in astrology and I think Carl Jung has</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.980" end="00:46:33.369" style="s2">some but I&#39;m not sure about that look</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.069" end="00:46:33.369" style="s2">into that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.500" end="00:46:43.580" style="s2">unmuting sorry mastery of the four</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.730" end="00:46:45.830" style="s2">elements doesn&#39;t necessarily restrict</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.580" end="00:46:47.570" style="s2">itself to the physical control of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.830" end="00:46:49.610" style="s2">you&#39;d also need to control the stories</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.570" end="00:46:52.520" style="s2">about those elements their distribution</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.610" end="00:46:56.060" style="s2">their usage what ideas those elements</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.520" end="00:46:59.120" style="s2">can generate every part of the mastery</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.060" end="00:47:03.710" style="s2">chain implies all the symbolic stuff as</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.120" end="00:47:06.050" style="s2">well I just want to make sure wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.710" end="00:47:08.830" style="s2">like purely the physical elements like</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.050" end="00:47:08.830" style="s2">physical world</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.930" end="00:47:26.220" style="s2">Mandelbrot did you want to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.830" end="00:47:30.530" style="s2">question now that you can alright I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.220" end="00:47:30.530" style="s2">gonna hand it over to Ravens question</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:37.170" style="s2">yeah so my question is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.530" end="00:47:38.760" style="s2">referencing that the higher keys that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.170" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">you brought that originated with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.760" end="00:47:44.730" style="s2">mother so do we need a new mother to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">begin the creation of a new chain of</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.730" end="00:47:50.010" style="s2">hierarchies yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:52.170" style="s2">Eve was a mistake Eve was a mistake I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.010" end="00:47:53.960" style="s2">saying it I&#39;m getting recorded it was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.170" end="00:47:56.700" style="s2">mistake there&#39;s actually some rather</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:47:59.610" style="s2">fascinating interpretations of Eve not</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.700" end="00:48:01.080" style="s2">just a biblical one or the Judaic one</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.610" end="00:48:03.570" style="s2">there&#39;s somehow chemical interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.080" end="00:48:06.300" style="s2">as well that just like that totally defy</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.570" end="00:48:08.250" style="s2">the mind it&#39;s funny the archetype of Eve</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.300" end="00:48:10.590" style="s2">is one of those things where you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.250" end="00:48:13.140" style="s2">okay it&#39;s the first woman it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.590" end="00:48:15.390" style="s2">really a motherly spirit to her I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.140" end="00:48:18.090" style="s2">know of any story of Eve where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.390" end="00:48:19.380" style="s2">oh I&#39;m a good mother that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.090" end="00:48:21.240" style="s2">one of those things that propagates</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.380" end="00:48:23.490" style="s2">around it&#39;s kind of weird when you think</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.240" end="00:48:27.030" style="s2">about that and technically she was like</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.490" end="00:48:28.860" style="s2">Jerry Springer material like I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.030" end="00:48:30.300" style="s2">look at how she ran everything like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.860" end="00:48:32.340" style="s2">idea of like oh here&#39;s the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.300" end="00:48:33.780" style="s2">wisdom and I&#39;m afraid to you know eat</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.340" end="00:48:35.310" style="s2">the Apple myself so I&#39;m gonna rope in</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.780" end="00:48:37.260" style="s2">the only human I can reach and get them</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.310" end="00:48:38.580" style="s2">into the blame cycle too and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.260" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">gonna have kids and one&#39;s gonna kill the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.580" end="00:48:40.710" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:43.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a Jerry Springer episode right so</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.710" end="00:48:47.850" style="s2">so not exactly the world&#39;s best mother I</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.320" end="00:48:51.330" style="s2">think it&#39;s probably worth reviewing why</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.850" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">Eve is not considered a mother I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.330" end="00:48:55.470" style="s2">start answering your question looking</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:58.850" style="s2">why that archetypal archetypical</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.470" end="00:48:58.850" style="s2">association just doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.510" end="00:49:23.220" style="s2">Hannah would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.100" end="00:49:24.510" style="s2">question these other types of brains but</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.220" end="00:49:27.800" style="s2">I was wondering if you could just read</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.510" end="00:49:32.600" style="s2">ascribe them again for clarity the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.800" end="00:49:38.790" style="s2">chimeric one and the AI and you know who</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.600" end="00:49:44.360" style="s2">the story is needing to go to mmm yes so</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.790" end="00:49:47.190" style="s2">the using what I&#39;m suggesting is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.360" end="00:49:48.780" style="s2">basically alchemical entropy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.190" end="00:49:51.360" style="s2">just input and output it&#39;s also waste</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.780" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">and the waste is ideas and symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.360" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">things like that so stories are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:57.240" style="s2">like garbage collection of that waste</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:59.550" style="s2">otherwise they just simmer in your head</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.240" end="00:50:01.290" style="s2">and they can either drive you insane or</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.550" end="00:50:03.540" style="s2">they can change your judgment making</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.290" end="00:50:05.700" style="s2">process or some way affect your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.540" end="00:50:07.320" style="s2">so the story is a way to get those</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.700" end="00:50:09.870" style="s2">symbols out of your head</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.320" end="00:50:12.840" style="s2">and waste is a admittedly yes it is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.870" end="00:50:15.390" style="s2">bad term I&#39;m using exclusively in</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.840" end="00:50:17.730" style="s2">entropic terms heat waste is what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.390" end="00:50:20.370" style="s2">so think of it like an input waste or</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.730" end="00:50:26.130" style="s2">you know just simple waste is probably</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.370" end="00:50:28.170" style="s2">more accurate but the the storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.130" end="00:50:30.810" style="s2">is an essential way of getting that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.170" end="00:50:32.820" style="s2">waste out of your system and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.810" end="00:50:34.320" style="s2">listening the stories also gets that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.820" end="00:50:35.940" style="s2">waste out of your system - so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.320" end="00:50:37.380" style="s2">actually have to tell the story just</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.940" end="00:50:39.560" style="s2">listening to it as a way to get it out</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.380" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">and flush out your system which is good</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.560" end="00:50:44.550" style="s2">now regarding the other two contenders</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">for cognition where we have the Gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.550" end="00:50:49.020" style="s2">stuff which is basically AI and then we</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.450" end="00:51:29.160" style="s2">course but what the storytellers look</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.819" end="00:51:31.980" style="s2">like for both of those things fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.160" end="00:51:34.019" style="s2">question the idea of like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.980" end="00:51:35.999" style="s2">tell a story to an AI well it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.019" end="00:51:38.249" style="s2">be like a human remember the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.999" end="00:51:40.710" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing is that storytelling is a</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:55.349" style="s2">well so if my if my categorization is</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.249" end="00:51:57.740" style="s2">predictive that would be my approach if</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.349" end="00:51:57.740" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.100" end="00:52:06.380" style="s2">got a question from Jessica what is the</p>

<p begin="00:52:16.220" end="00:52:23.660" style="s2">asked the finding there are 13</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.010" end="00:52:26.180" style="s2">unanswered questions in science right</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.660" end="00:52:27.770" style="s2">now I think maybe 12 I think the pond</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.180" end="00:52:29.600" style="s2">care conjecture was actually resolved</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.770" end="00:52:32.780" style="s2">but there&#39;s like stuff about dark matter</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.600" end="00:52:34.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s just not resolved there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.780" end="00:52:36.710" style="s2">genuinely unresolved questions and there</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.550" end="00:52:38.450" style="s2">is some discussion and debate about a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.710" end="00:52:40.220" style="s2">philosophy of science is why that is why</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.450" end="00:52:41.810" style="s2">hasn&#39;t if science and all of its power</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.220" end="00:52:43.220" style="s2">and all of its predictive modeling and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.810" end="00:52:44.540" style="s2">all of our genius and computers and our</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.220" end="00:52:46.970" style="s2">cognition and all over the place why</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.540" end="00:52:49.400" style="s2">can&#39;t we solve these thirteen points do</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.970" end="00:52:50.990" style="s2">we just need more complexity if we had</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.400" end="00:52:53.800" style="s2">more complexity do we do we resolve</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.990" end="00:52:56.120" style="s2">these questions I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.800" end="00:53:00.290" style="s2">this has opened up an interesting debate</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.120" end="00:53:02.270" style="s2">I think about ten years ago where it got</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.290" end="00:53:04.760" style="s2">so heated as to why these questions</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.270" end="00:53:06.290" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be answered where the debate</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.760" end="00:53:08.780" style="s2">basically boiled down to his math</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.290" end="00:53:12.380" style="s2">invented or discovered that&#39;s how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.780" end="00:53:14.690" style="s2">how insane the discussion got they were</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.380" end="00:53:17.630" style="s2">definitely theories of mind were</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.690" end="00:53:19.550" style="s2">contending pretty heavily in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.630" end="00:53:21.410" style="s2">what did we get wrong where do we make</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.550" end="00:53:23.420" style="s2">the mistake it was it was a glorious</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.410" end="00:53:26.450" style="s2">moment of scientific introspection which</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.420" end="00:53:28.790" style="s2">usually doesn&#39;t happen like you see you</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.450" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">see this introspection kind of appear in</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.790" end="00:53:32.180" style="s2">peer review and other parts of the chain</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">but you you don&#39;t see it like</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.180" end="00:53:38.710" style="s2">collectively at the entirety of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.460" end="00:53:43.540" style="s2">scientific institutions themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.710" end="00:53:46.370" style="s2">trying to find those points to then</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.540" end="00:53:48.140" style="s2">challenge yourself and say okay do I</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.370" end="00:53:50.180" style="s2">simply put faith in scientists to solve</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.140" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">this for me and it&#39;s a non participation</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.180" end="00:53:54.500" style="s2">sport and I&#39;m just simply watching if</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:56.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the case why do you fucking care</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.500" end="00:53:58.550" style="s2">about science like if it&#39;s if not if</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.780" end="00:53:59.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not participatory then and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.550" end="00:54:02.840" style="s2">just watching it like a damn commercial</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.960" end="00:54:05.270" style="s2">then stop fucking caring because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.840" end="00:54:08.300" style="s2">just you know not you the person at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.270" end="00:54:09.950" style="s2">preferably used or I&#39;m talking about if</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.300" end="00:54:10.940" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get involved it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.950" end="00:54:12.290" style="s2">matter to you and if you think just</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.940" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">science falls from trees if you wait</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.290" end="00:54:15.840" style="s2">long enough great</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:17.580" style="s2">consumer experience of science question</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.840" end="00:54:19.740" style="s2">why that&#39;s your experience of science</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.580" end="00:54:22.560" style="s2">what are you being deprived of if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.740" end="00:54:25.950" style="s2">your take what aren&#39;t you being exposed</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.560" end="00:54:28.140" style="s2">to that&#39;s his place to start but yet</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.950" end="00:54:29.790" style="s2">finding you know seriously trying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.140" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">answer why these things are unanswerable</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.790" end="00:54:34.300" style="s2">is a good way to the challenge your</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:36.860" style="s2">assumptions about the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.300" end="00:54:38.150" style="s2">just a quick follow-up on that towards</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.860" end="00:54:40.940" style="s2">the end of your presentation you said</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.150" end="00:54:43.700" style="s2">something about science being dead could</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.940" end="00:54:45.710" style="s2">you elaborate on that and define how you</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.700" end="00:54:48.190" style="s2">use the word science in that expression</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.710" end="00:54:51.050" style="s2">the scientific methodology in particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.190" end="00:54:54.170" style="s2">so two scientific methodologies limits</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.050" end="00:54:57.260" style="s2">are laid bare and exposed when you deal</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.170" end="00:55:00.170" style="s2">with Gaussian black boxes and chimeric</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.260" end="00:55:06.230" style="s2">cognition so you&#39;re not gonna you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.170" end="00:55:09.950" style="s2">gonna get its god forbid like what does</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.230" end="00:55:11.990" style="s2">Neanderthal math look like do we do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.950" end="00:55:14.030" style="s2">just assume it&#39;s just oh it has to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.990" end="00:55:15.890" style="s2">follow the laws of love Cheers does it</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.030" end="00:55:17.450" style="s2">have to follow the laws of logic just</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.890" end="00:55:19.310" style="s2">because we followed the laws of logic is</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.450" end="00:55:21.890" style="s2">there a biological component to what</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.630" style="s2">all of time okay yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.220" end="00:55:32.750" style="s2">repeatable in both the domain of the</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.320" end="00:55:39.530" style="s2">that&#39;s true but what logic are we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.200" end="00:55:41.690" style="s2">selecting for what are we focused on</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.530" end="00:55:44.950" style="s2">what are we improving upon at the</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.950" end="00:55:49.700" style="s2">does that hold what we&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.630" end="00:55:50.180" style="s2">when a chimeric brain does the same</p>

<p begin="00:55:50.180" end="00:55:54.230" style="s2">maybe they focus on something else what</p>

<p begin="00:55:54.230" end="00:55:58.220" style="s2">math right what kuiper will focus</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.180" end="00:55:59.930" style="s2">primarily on geometry I&#39;d imagine or</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.220" end="00:56:01.700" style="s2">maybe stochastic mathematics would be</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.710" end="00:56:59.870" style="s2">this AI whisperer shaman character can</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.560" end="00:57:01.190" style="s2">play it like a flute is that that echo</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.870" end="00:57:07.550" style="s2">line up maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.190" end="00:57:09.830" style="s2">could the ideally yes that&#39;s effectively</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.550" end="00:57:12.290" style="s2">what a storyteller is they&#39;re able to if</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.830" end="00:57:14.660" style="s2">you if you can storyteller affects the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.290" end="00:57:17.390" style="s2">transportation chains so and it does</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.660" end="00:57:20.450" style="s2">that by tapping into that into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.390" end="00:57:23.450" style="s2">symbolic waste so you have these a is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.450" end="00:57:27.530" style="s2">there a transportation chain of them it</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.450" end="00:57:29.600" style="s2">injects one I data point or knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.530" end="00:57:31.490" style="s2">point or story or whichever or narrative</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.600" end="00:57:33.320" style="s2">and then all the other a eyes follows</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.490" end="00:57:35.630" style="s2">suit now they eyes don&#39;t know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.320" end="00:57:37.310" style="s2">following suit they&#39;re just following</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.630" end="00:57:40.670" style="s2">what the output of the previous one was</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.310" end="00:57:43.580" style="s2">so instead of so acting like a whisper</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.670" end="00:57:45.440" style="s2">yeah effectively and it&#39;s it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.580" end="00:57:46.180" style="s2">the entire transmutation change that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.440" end="00:57:49.970" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.180" end="00:57:52.660" style="s2">and so something can be planted in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.970" end="00:57:58.690" style="s2">story maybe that has a time-sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.660" end="00:57:58.690" style="s2">blossoming that&#39;s right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.710" end="00:58:08.930" style="s2">question so is there possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.050" end="00:58:14.810" style="s2">this kind of super structure of society</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.930" end="00:58:17.570" style="s2">of civilization can kind of develop once</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.810" end="00:58:20.750" style="s2">of its own kind of thing in line with</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.570" end="00:58:23.360" style="s2">stuff like Kevin Kelly talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.750" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">Technium having a kind of its own wants</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.360" end="00:58:28.280" style="s2">what technology wants is having a level</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:33.830" style="s2">of complexity that kind of breaks away</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.280" end="00:58:35.750" style="s2">from human desires and we&#39;ll yeah mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.830" end="00:58:37.610" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s um I mean we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.750" end="00:58:42.020" style="s2">there regarding high-frequency trading</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.610" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">algorithms and some of the advertising</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.020" end="00:58:46.700" style="s2">and electoral stuff that&#39;s going on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:48.320" style="s2">not even</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.700" end="00:58:49.790" style="s2">it&#39;s not even us doing it we literally</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.320" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">can&#39;t get out of the high frequency</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.790" end="00:58:55.190" style="s2">trading we&#39;re stuck in it or we we</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.920" end="00:58:57.619" style="s2">actually depend upon it so is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.190" end="00:58:59.990" style="s2">technology demonstrating a want or a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.619" end="00:59:02.450" style="s2">desire the same way we do it in symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.990" end="00:59:05.720" style="s2">terms and symbolic language probably not</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.450" end="00:59:07.550" style="s2">but from an evolutionary perspective it</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.720" end="00:59:09.140" style="s2">certainly is it&#39;s demonstrating a</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.550" end="00:59:12.260" style="s2">selection criteria at the very minimum</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.140" end="00:59:14.150" style="s2">it&#39;s saying these type of a eyes get to</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.260" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">exist whereas other ones don&#39;t so these</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.150" end="00:59:16.070" style="s2">get all the resources where other ones</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:17.750" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.070" end="00:59:19.609" style="s2">and in this case high-frequency trading</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.750" end="00:59:21.500" style="s2">algorithms they get a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.609" end="00:59:23.420" style="s2">resources and they keep things afloat</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.500" end="00:59:24.980" style="s2">and then there&#39;s an entire ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.420" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">people who hack them like they will</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.980" end="00:59:28.490" style="s2">literally write blog articles to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:29.960" style="s2">headline them just to head-fake to add</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.490" end="00:59:32.810" style="s2">the high frequency trading algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.960" end="00:59:34.310" style="s2">some bullshit news so like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.810" end="00:59:36.680" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.310" end="00:59:38.839" style="s2">journalists are doing that like crazy</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.680" end="00:59:40.579" style="s2">insider trading stuff and they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.839" end="00:59:42.710" style="s2">busted in one day the SEC is gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.579" end="00:59:44.690" style="s2">into women it&#39;s gonna be hilarious but</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.710" end="00:59:46.460" style="s2">until that day comes we depend upon</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.690" end="00:59:50.510" style="s2">those high-frequency trading algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.460" end="00:59:53.660" style="s2">to you know make line Gober and as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.510" end="00:59:54.950" style="s2">result it is selecting for us as much as</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.660" end="00:59:56.200" style="s2">we&#39;re selecting for it but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.950" end="00:59:58.730" style="s2">starting to select for us at this point</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.200" end="01:00:00.020" style="s2">so it does it is demonstrating once it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.730" end="01:00:02.210" style="s2">needs it&#39;s selecting it&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.020" end="01:00:08.180" style="s2">demonstrating a selection pressure let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.210" end="01:00:11.150" style="s2">just leave it there so that I have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.180" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">question about like geopolitical Dark</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.150" end="01:00:17.990" style="s2">Arts mainly around Russia and the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:19.790" style="s2">philosopher Alexander Dugan because I</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.990" end="01:00:21.230" style="s2">know he&#39;s a pretty eclectic thinker and</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.790" end="01:00:23.540" style="s2">he&#39;s into I think he flirts with chaos</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.230" end="01:00:26.420" style="s2">magic and like radical traditional</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.540" end="01:00:28.550" style="s2">Orthodox Christianity do you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.420" end="01:00:29.960" style="s2">anything about that like how other kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.550" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">of players are using this type of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.960" end="01:00:36.470" style="s2">that&#39;s not like glitter scientism yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:37.819" style="s2">that that&#39;s an example of that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.470" end="01:00:39.109" style="s2">example of the alchemy I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.819" end="01:00:42.470" style="s2">where you&#39;re playing with the different</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.109" end="01:00:44.540" style="s2">types of cognition but we&#39;ve seen on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.470" end="01:00:46.420" style="s2">chance this type of thing manifest or</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.540" end="01:00:48.950" style="s2">certain memes flow and other ones don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.420" end="01:00:51.560" style="s2">that Pepe is just everywhere these days</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.950" end="01:00:54.109" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of stuff behind that</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.560" end="01:00:55.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just tricking the human</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.109" end="01:00:58.819" style="s2">reader it&#39;s also actively tricking the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.880" end="01:01:00.500" style="s2">ai&#39;s - and and the humans then the human</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.819" end="01:01:03.890" style="s2">readers are in turn tricking the AI</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.500" end="01:01:05.600" style="s2">back recursively as it goes down and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.890" end="01:01:07.730" style="s2">down so that&#39;s definitely chaos magic is</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.600" end="01:01:10.490" style="s2">good is it alchemy yes it is practiced</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.730" end="01:01:12.650" style="s2">subtly in the traditional sense where it</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.490" end="01:01:14.360" style="s2">is it is a black box and you by trial</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.650" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">and error you say okay do I get the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.360" end="01:01:18.080" style="s2">signal I want yes no okay keep iterating</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:23.210" style="s2">iterate and iterate and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.080" end="01:01:25.280" style="s2">actually it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.210" end="01:01:27.140" style="s2">like scale-invariant entropy where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.280" end="01:01:29.390" style="s2">constantly reducing down to that which</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.140" end="01:01:31.670" style="s2">cannot be reduced any further and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.390" end="01:01:33.950" style="s2">you build your structures on top of</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.670" end="01:01:35.210" style="s2">those irreducible x&#39; so in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.950" end="01:01:37.100" style="s2">that they&#39;re trying to find the</p>

<p begin="01:01:47.810" end="01:01:52.460" style="s2">transmutation chains are then selected</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.510" end="01:01:53.870" style="s2">harvested and other things are built on</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.460" end="01:01:55.370" style="s2">top of that whether it&#39;s a political</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.870" end="01:01:56.390" style="s2">system or religion or anything else so</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.370" end="01:01:59.150" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.390" end="01:02:01.880" style="s2">the Russians are actively trying out</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.150" end="01:02:05.000" style="s2">this type of stuff the Chinese have been</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.880" end="01:02:07.820" style="s2">doing it but they have they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.000" end="01:02:10.040" style="s2">not very creative on this front they</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.820" end="01:02:11.840" style="s2">they just found a way to hack most of</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.040" end="01:02:13.880" style="s2">American progressive blue church stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.840" end="01:02:16.010" style="s2">they&#39;re not necessarily innovating the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.880" end="01:02:18.500" style="s2">same way the Russians are the Americans</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.010" end="01:02:21.020" style="s2">special special operations certainly are</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.500" end="01:02:22.970" style="s2">doing so SOCOM is doing that I know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.020" end="01:02:25.670" style="s2">the radicals to radicalization stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.970" end="01:02:28.190" style="s2">doing that there are certain parties in</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.670" end="01:02:30.380" style="s2">Islam that are doing that they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.190" end="01:02:32.390" style="s2">a lot of credit but Muslim Brotherhood</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.380" end="01:02:35.240" style="s2">is most certainly playing that game and</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.390" end="01:02:38.620" style="s2">it plays it very well so yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.240" end="01:02:38.620" style="s2">definitely geopolitical contenders</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.920" end="01:02:51.850" style="s2">Christian said something about scalar</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.030" end="01:02:52.990" style="s2">resonance and Daniel had a question that</p>

<p begin="01:02:52.990" end="01:03:03.820" style="s2">like to ask that question sure I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.940" end="01:03:07.060" style="s2">know what the previous I don&#39;t know what</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.060" end="01:03:12.790" style="s2">this talk but I thought was interesting</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:17.770" style="s2">scalar okay meaning of scale resonance</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.580" end="01:04:24.220" style="s2">structural yeah that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.770" end="01:04:26.980" style="s2">indicative of what I think is how human</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.220" end="01:04:29.020" style="s2">socialization works so the idea of</p>

<p begin="01:04:35.260" end="01:04:40.840" style="s2">signals of you know mating signals all</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.990" end="01:04:42.640" style="s2">of these things are protocols of human</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.840" end="01:04:45.580" style="s2">communication and they do have structure</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.640" end="01:04:46.900" style="s2">and by structure I mean limitations so</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.580" end="01:04:48.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t they don&#39;t have like a</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.900" end="01:04:51.010" style="s2">structure like they have like hard code</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.430" end="01:04:52.240" style="s2">and they have like you know data bases</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.010" end="01:04:53.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what I mean what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.240" end="01:04:55.990" style="s2">is there are hard limits to what type of</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.950" end="01:04:57.820" style="s2">information can go through that and what</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.990" end="01:04:58.990" style="s2">type of information is transmuted as it</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.820" end="01:04:59.540" style="s2">goes through that so that&#39;s the action</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.990" end="01:05:03.350" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.540" end="01:05:04.430" style="s2">self bumpers and gutters yeah right yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.350" end="01:05:07.550" style="s2">that&#39;s right gutters yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.430" end="01:05:11.240" style="s2">and so how those are time delay between</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.550" end="01:05:13.880" style="s2">one another memes are playing off of</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.240" end="01:05:15.770" style="s2">that so for example the type of research</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.880" end="01:05:19.370" style="s2">that goes on when it comes to me more</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.770" end="01:05:20.900" style="s2">fair like this is some horror stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.370" end="01:05:22.580" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna jump into two things and</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.900" end="01:05:25.340" style="s2">they&#39;re absolutely terrifying the first</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.580" end="01:05:28.580" style="s2">is when the DoD researched memes for</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.340" end="01:05:30.500" style="s2">weaponization back in 2009 they found</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.580" end="01:05:32.060" style="s2">that all kinds of stuff for starters</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.500" end="01:05:33.650" style="s2">they found all kinds of wild stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.060" end="01:05:36.740" style="s2">then they found there&#39;s a document</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.650" end="01:05:39.890" style="s2">floating around on page I think 96 where</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.740" end="01:05:42.320" style="s2">they explore suicide memes meaning memes</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.890" end="01:05:45.230" style="s2">that drive people to commit suicide they</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.320" end="01:05:50.530" style="s2">found repeatably demonstrably repeatable</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.230" end="01:05:53.390" style="s2">that suicide was contagious contagious</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.530" end="01:05:55.720" style="s2">mmm-hmm meaning one person does it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.390" end="01:05:57.740" style="s2">then other people around them do it</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.720" end="01:06:00.950" style="s2">right and they were able to activate</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.740" end="01:06:04.130" style="s2">that through memes alone mmm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.950" end="01:06:05.810" style="s2">that&#39;s fuckin crazy pants and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.130" end="01:06:07.550" style="s2">someone else decided to go further with</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.810" end="01:06:10.010" style="s2">it was something this wonderful little</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.550" end="01:06:11.780" style="s2">space that everyone called tumblr it</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.010" end="01:06:13.070" style="s2">turns out that when you take tumblr and</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.780" end="01:06:14.810" style="s2">you turn it into a data science</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.070" end="01:06:16.670" style="s2">experiment what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.810" end="01:06:19.820" style="s2">able to find mental illness and what it</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.670" end="01:06:21.580" style="s2">looks like in the data science space so</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.820" end="01:06:24.740" style="s2">that you can then identify isolate</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.580" end="01:06:27.170" style="s2">reproduce promote d-- promote whatever</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.740" end="01:06:29.150" style="s2">you want to do you can orchestrate just</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.170" end="01:06:32.030" style="s2">by the memes alone you can say okay this</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.150" end="01:06:34.460" style="s2">person is is ADHD this person has</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.030" end="01:06:36.800" style="s2">bipolar disorder this person has these</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.460" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">and I can look at the actual data</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.800" end="01:06:40.910" style="s2">science flow of that that they have</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:42.650" style="s2">science structure of that so then I can</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.910" end="01:06:45.260" style="s2">identify people who have the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.650" end="01:06:48.350" style="s2">structural signature but they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.260" end="01:06:50.150" style="s2">they&#39;re mentally ill yet so now I can</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.350" end="01:06:52.010" style="s2">really fuck with them and they were</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.150" end="01:06:53.900" style="s2">doing that this this was being done</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.010" end="01:06:55.850" style="s2">across the board for advertising for</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.900" end="01:07:02.210" style="s2">military academic experiments this was</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.850" end="01:07:05.500" style="s2">being done so the scalar resonance is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.210" end="01:07:09.230" style="s2">probable is I&#39;m taking a shot at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.500" end="01:07:11.540" style="s2">definition here but that type of thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.230" end="01:07:13.339" style="s2">where I put the meme in the channel and</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.540" end="01:07:15.799" style="s2">then I get the behavior and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.339" end="01:07:17.089" style="s2">spreads and then that tracks more and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.799" end="01:07:19.789" style="s2">then that spreads and it keeps going</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.089" end="01:07:21.950" style="s2">yeah it is it&#39;s it&#39;s debits trying for</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.789" end="01:07:24.349" style="s2">scale invariance memes are always trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.950" end="01:07:25.759" style="s2">for scale invariance and it&#39;s every so</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.349" end="01:07:30.019" style="s2">often you get that one that just like</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.759" end="01:07:32.960" style="s2">pops off right so that&#39;s how an a I can</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.019" end="01:07:33.859" style="s2">discern it is there a human with a body</p>

<p begin="01:07:37.099" end="01:07:42.950" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be so glib you would need the</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.589" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">data but there are people who know when</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.950" end="01:07:46.999" style="s2">things are fucked up hmm something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:48.259" style="s2">wrong here</p>

<p begin="01:09:42.880" end="01:09:52.870" style="s2">discovery strategy it is once again</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.600" end="01:09:55.210" style="s2">useful because metaphysics are back and</p>

<p begin="01:10:06.350" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">minute and say wait what a eyes are at</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.630" end="01:10:12.590" style="s2">work here what&#39;s actually changing the</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:14.330" style="s2">flow of things is it that the people are</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.590" end="01:10:16.940" style="s2">stupid or is it that the Skinner box</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.330" end="01:10:18.980" style="s2">they&#39;re in is making them stupid and if</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.940" end="01:10:20.179" style="s2">the your answer is the Skinner box well</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.980" end="01:10:23.469" style="s2">now you have the tools to actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.179" end="01:10:23.469" style="s2">analyze that Skinner box</p>

<p begin="01:10:33.420" end="01:10:39.679" style="s2">it do you want to bring us home once</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.039" end="01:10:43.409" style="s2">again why does this always happen I</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.679" end="01:10:45.030" style="s2">don&#39;t understand well I do in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.409" end="01:10:47.309" style="s2">and I really appreciate Patrick for it</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.030" end="01:10:51.059" style="s2">being able to go through these things um</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.309" end="01:10:55.739" style="s2">and story-tell in general and you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.059" end="01:10:57.989" style="s2">just I left after emblem 21 because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:11:04.289" end="01:11:10.230" style="s2">useful alchemy um even though I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.929" end="01:11:15.239" style="s2">listened to it yeah and i will hello so</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.230" end="01:11:17.489" style="s2">a question is on Eve I guess because</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.239" end="01:11:20.460" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting symbol for sure um</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.489" end="01:11:22.739" style="s2">and it&#39;s because that&#39;s the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.460" end="01:11:30.480" style="s2">that I came into when I joined the zoom</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.739" end="01:11:34.289" style="s2">cult when Raven asked the question so oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.480" end="01:11:36.179" style="s2">thank you clips um can you explain the</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.289" end="01:11:38.969" style="s2">answer to Ravens question again if</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.179" end="01:11:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s okay yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s T the idea</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.969" end="01:11:44.489" style="s2">I started my example with woman and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.960" end="01:11:45.869" style="s2">started there because that&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.489" end="01:11:47.639" style="s2">start with so alchemy you start with a</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.869" end="01:11:52.050" style="s2">man and a woman you&#39;re supposed to start</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.639" end="01:11:53.429" style="s2">there and well she was asking maybe if</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.050" end="01:11:54.750" style="s2">you get a new mother you get a totally</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.429" end="01:11:58.050" style="s2">different transportation shame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.750" end="01:12:00.150" style="s2">true and that then she asked about the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.050" end="01:12:05.309" style="s2">archetypes of mothers that existed and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.150" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">just went off on Eve cuz her but the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.309" end="01:12:12.449" style="s2">idea of Eve not Eve is rarely associated</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:15.329" style="s2">with like motherly acts and I wonder why</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.449" end="01:12:19.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an interesting lack of</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.329" end="01:12:22.260" style="s2">that type of storytelling behind the eve</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.010" end="01:12:24.659" style="s2">the evening where it&#39;s not a loving</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.260" end="01:12:27.630" style="s2">mother she&#39;s not a caring mother she</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.659" end="01:12:29.010" style="s2">she&#39;s just like maybe she&#39;s just on the</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.630" end="01:12:31.590" style="s2">hook for her mistakes for all of time</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.010" end="01:12:33.630" style="s2">who knows but the motherhood part is</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.590" end="01:12:36.150" style="s2">just completely glossed over regarding</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.630" end="01:12:38.869" style="s2">Eve&#39;s actions and I think that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.150" end="01:12:42.630" style="s2">exploring why that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.869" end="01:12:45.719" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s really cool um I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.630" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">to say that in it like it the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.719" end="01:12:50.460" style="s2">just because it was another point about</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.239" end="01:12:52.530" style="s2">the Girardi and interpretation of Eve if</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.460" end="01:12:53.849" style="s2">you know if I don&#39;t know that one and</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.530" end="01:12:56.670" style="s2">then the other thing that came to mind</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.849" end="01:12:59.639" style="s2">when you mentioned that is like the</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.670" end="01:13:01.980" style="s2">symbolism for Mary and is it like Adam</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.639" end="01:13:07.219" style="s2">and Eve like the children of God first</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.980" end="01:13:09.900" style="s2">before I like being a mother to children</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.219" end="01:13:12.989" style="s2">but it makes me sort of very curious</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.900" end="01:13:15.059" style="s2">about this those symbols so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.989" end="01:13:16.079" style="s2">definitely be reading into that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.059" end="01:13:18.540" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s some wild</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.079" end="01:13:20.639" style="s2">interpretations depending upon what sect</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.540" end="01:13:22.409" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at and what time you want</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.639" end="01:13:24.719" style="s2">to look at that sect to because the</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.409" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">Christians have made through all the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.719" end="01:13:28.559" style="s2">sects they have very different</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:31.170" style="s2">interpretations the same through Judea</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.559" end="01:13:34.170" style="s2">the same for the Gnostics the most</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.170" end="01:13:36.329" style="s2">interesting one I&#39;ve read was that they</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.170" end="01:13:39.270" style="s2">weren&#39;t necessarily the children of God</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.329" end="01:13:42.179" style="s2">they were the fire of God and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.270" end="01:13:45.090" style="s2">that was a mistranslation the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.179" end="01:13:48.050" style="s2">birth of instead Adam was the fire of</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.090" end="01:13:50.929" style="s2">God and Eve was the fire of Adam that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.050" end="01:13:54.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a wildly different interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.929" end="01:13:56.219" style="s2">the idea of fire meaning you know fire</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.510" end="01:13:58.739" style="s2">is one of the first things that mankind</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.219" end="01:14:00.719" style="s2">could actually spread logarithmically or</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.739" end="01:14:02.309" style="s2">exponentially so I like this thing on</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.719" end="01:14:03.690" style="s2">fire that everything is on fire right so</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.309" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">it&#39;s the very first exponential</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.690" end="01:14:08.280" style="s2">technology so the idea of the fire of</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.239" end="01:14:10.170" style="s2">God we are the exponential technology of</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.280" end="01:14:12.030" style="s2">God and Eve is the exponential</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.170" end="01:14:13.739" style="s2">technology of Adam so that is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.030" end="01:14:15.989" style="s2">fundamentally different way of looking</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.739" end="01:14:17.969" style="s2">at that entire mythology so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.989" end="01:14:27.030" style="s2">say maybe it&#39;s worth revisiting that</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.969" end="01:14:29.460" style="s2">type of stuff all right with that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.030" end="01:14:31.260" style="s2">bring it to close let&#39;s give it up for</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.460" end="01:14:34.949" style="s2">Pat thank you so much again for your</p>
