<p begin="00:00:35.710" end="00:00:41.440" style="s2">Canada and we obviously can&#39;t meet right</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.260" end="00:00:43.930" style="s2">now so I&#39;d launched this space which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.440" end="00:00:45.760" style="s2">viewing as a digital campfire where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.930" end="00:00:47.530" style="s2">can Co hear and dialogue about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:50.739" style="s2">matters most at the nice edge at this</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.530" end="00:00:52.930" style="s2">moment and I&#39;m also doing this as an</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.739" end="00:00:55.989" style="s2">experimental space inviting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.930" end="00:00:58.600" style="s2">friends and people I trust to do all</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.989" end="00:01:01.629" style="s2">sorts of different activities practices</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.600" end="00:01:04.510" style="s2">psycho technologies and today my friend</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.629" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">Jared Jaynes from the both end podcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.510" end="00:01:09.820" style="s2">it&#39;s going to do a meditative experiment</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:11.320" style="s2">there&#39;s this meme going around I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.820" end="00:01:13.240" style="s2">it started in Canada called care</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.320" end="00:01:15.369" style="s2">mongering so instead of fear-mongering</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.240" end="00:01:18.729" style="s2">like you know let&#39;s replace it with care</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.369" end="00:01:21.670" style="s2">mongering and Jared is gonna do a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.729" end="00:01:23.320" style="s2">meditative spin on that so I&#39;ll hand it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.670" end="00:01:25.180" style="s2">to him in a moment it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.320" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">about 30 minutes today&#39;s session and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.180" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">then I&#39;ll do some closing announcements</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:37.000" style="s2">so that being said I&#39;ll hand it over to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:41.380" style="s2">Jared all righty</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.000" end="00:01:45.670" style="s2">hmm can you see me all right</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.380" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">direct I thought I used the nice mic as</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.670" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">opposed to my little Apple things so my</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:56.020" style="s2">beard isn&#39;t my courting beard isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">scratching all over and things but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.020" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">well well thanks for coming today</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.579" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">so as Peter said there&#39;s this meme of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.350" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">about care mongering and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:17.260" style="s2">powerful to me in a lot of ways but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:25.959" style="s2">main way being that in these times of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">kind of uncertainty and adversity when</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.959" end="00:02:32.019" style="s2">it comes to the actual way that we act</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:33.190" style="s2">in the world to work together to move</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.019" end="00:02:35.290" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.190" end="00:02:38.519" style="s2">I think care needs to be at the center</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.290" end="00:02:45.959" style="s2">of our experience or maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.519" end="00:02:49.209" style="s2">predominant place that we act from and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.959" end="00:02:51.690" style="s2">so when I think about this the funny</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.209" end="00:02:54.430" style="s2">thing is is that so much of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.690" end="00:02:58.780" style="s2">experiences is both kind of a mind and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.430" end="00:03:00.880" style="s2">body thing we&#39;re not just Minds if we if</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.780" end="00:03:02.709" style="s2">we get lost and thinking all the time it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.880" end="00:03:04.420" style="s2">can be we can gonna find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.709" end="00:03:07.690" style="s2">outside of our body and not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.420" end="00:03:11.079" style="s2">where we&#39;re acting from and so and as</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.690" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">you can imagine care usually comes from</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.079" end="00:03:15.810" style="s2">the heart center you know there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:19.269" style="s2">certain cultures in the past that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.810" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">thought that the self was located behind</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.269" end="00:03:24.340" style="s2">the chest not the head this is a Western</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:26.500" style="s2">predominant Western concept that we live</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.340" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">from and so it&#39;s possible to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.500" end="00:03:32.889" style="s2">live from multiple areas in our body and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">so what I want to do today with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.889" end="00:03:37.299" style="s2">meditation which will be right around my</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:44.290" style="s2">thinking I&#39;m thinking about 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.299" end="00:03:48.580" style="s2">is talk a bit about how care can act in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.290" end="00:03:50.530" style="s2">its most kind of wholesome fashion and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.580" end="00:03:53.740" style="s2">couldn&#39;t focus just on that that space</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.530" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">but I think one of the important things</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.740" end="00:03:57.070" style="s2">to realize at this moment is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:03:58.510" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.070" end="00:04:01.210" style="s2">things in our experience that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.510" end="00:04:04.150" style="s2">demanding our attention and we can find</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.210" end="00:04:07.630" style="s2">ourselves acting from them as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.150" end="00:04:11.770" style="s2">think when care is is most informed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.630" end="00:04:15.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s getting feedback from all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.770" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">aspects of our experience mental</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.090" end="00:04:24.430" style="s2">physical and and so and there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">predominant areas that I&#39;ve noticed kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.430" end="00:04:29.560" style="s2">of very overtly in the way that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">are communicating these days the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.560" end="00:04:34.990" style="s2">one is kind of the most foundational</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:37.300" style="s2">human one which is just this raw sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.990" end="00:04:39.880" style="s2">of survival right this is our gut this</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.300" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">is this is the thing that grounds us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.880" end="00:04:47.140" style="s2">the earth and in times of like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.990" end="00:04:50.350" style="s2">where we kind of are reminded of some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.140" end="00:04:54.010" style="s2">our fragility that that we won&#39;t last</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.350" end="00:04:56.350" style="s2">forever we can this the survival</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.010" end="00:04:58.660" style="s2">mechanisms and sense to to come up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.350" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">that usually comes like feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.660" end="00:05:02.200" style="s2">our you know maybe our stomachs moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:05.560" style="s2">up into our throats or something like</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.200" end="00:05:08.919" style="s2">that and and so this is going to kick in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.560" end="00:05:10.600" style="s2">a bunch of survival mechanisms and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.919" end="00:05:12.669" style="s2">can be very valuable you know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.600" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">make sure that we&#39;re healthy that were</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.669" end="00:05:20.680" style="s2">we have what we need to to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">toward other people as well and so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.680" end="00:05:26.200" style="s2">is an important part of the equation but</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:28.020" style="s2">if we get constricted in this this space</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.200" end="00:05:30.280" style="s2">where we&#39;re only acting from our gut</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.020" end="00:05:31.990" style="s2">then you know it starts to feed back</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.280" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a feedback loop that starts and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.990" end="00:05:36.940" style="s2">when you start maybe being a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:39.010" style="s2">more in a paddock this usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.940" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">represents in one of three ways fight</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.010" end="00:05:45.580" style="s2">flight or freeze right some people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:47.470" style="s2">depending on everybody&#39;s predisposition</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.580" end="00:05:50.380" style="s2">they can fall into those categories if</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.470" end="00:05:56.169" style="s2">they&#39;re only activating this survival</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.380" end="00:05:56.840" style="s2">part of their experience the second so</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.169" end="00:05:59.810" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.840" end="00:06:02.600" style="s2">moving up to the heart center one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.810" end="00:06:05.660" style="s2">things that you know predominantly it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.600" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">about the connection to the larger world</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.660" end="00:06:09.260" style="s2">and mostly in our experience because</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:11.870" style="s2">there were social creatures that means</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.260" end="00:06:17.810" style="s2">other people but but it definitely goes</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.870" end="00:06:20.570" style="s2">to nature as well and right now there</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.810" end="00:06:23.180" style="s2">might be some really challenging aspects</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.570" end="00:06:24.979" style="s2">of this part of our experience in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.180" end="00:06:27.560" style="s2">sense that you know we&#39;re kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.979" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">eyes isolating ourselves so we might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.560" end="00:06:34.130" style="s2">feeling a little lonely we are hearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:39.320" style="s2">stories of people who are struggling and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.130" end="00:06:43.400" style="s2">feeling a little bit sad and and these</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.320" end="00:06:45.979" style="s2">can be hard to sit with but this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.400" end="00:06:48.169" style="s2">of this is the yin to the yang like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.979" end="00:06:49.729" style="s2">this is what comes with being in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.169" end="00:06:56.870" style="s2">communion with other people and being</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.729" end="00:06:59.000" style="s2">able to act from care and so so yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.870" end="00:07:02.320" style="s2">we find ourselves in a challenging spot</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.000" end="00:07:05.960" style="s2">with our heart we know that we can act</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.320" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">in the positive opposite of of this of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.960" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to be acting from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:12.200" style="s2">space and then also include some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.729" style="s2">the gut stuff too you know sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.200" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">the best way to care is just to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.729" end="00:07:18.110" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re healthy that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:22.340" style="s2">your family&#39;s healthy something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.110" end="00:07:25.669" style="s2">that right and then the last space I</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.340" end="00:07:27.560" style="s2">want to talk about is the the head right</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.669" end="00:07:31.580" style="s2">this is where most of us live for spend</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.560" end="00:07:34.430" style="s2">most of our times and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.580" end="00:07:36.139" style="s2">people might be for the first time in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.430" end="00:07:37.550" style="s2">while getting out of their head you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.139" end="00:07:39.789" style="s2">I might realized that they were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.550" end="00:07:42.500" style="s2">daydreaming and thinking about all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.789" end="00:07:44.780" style="s2">future possibilities and the way things</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.500" end="00:07:48.530" style="s2">were going to go and now there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.780" end="00:07:51.380" style="s2">uncertainty that it&#39;s kind of pushing us</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.530" end="00:07:58.419" style="s2">back into our bodies and I can be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.380" end="00:08:01.490" style="s2">jarring and I think the head when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.419" end="00:08:06.620" style="s2">in its most natural state it&#39;s very open</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.490" end="00:08:09.080" style="s2">right so in times like this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.620" end="00:08:10.630" style="s2">very open or when it&#39;s very open there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.080" end="00:08:13.740" style="s2">also a lot of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.630" end="00:08:17.440" style="s2">these kind of things come together and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.740" end="00:08:20.830" style="s2">when we only spend time in our head that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:22.630" style="s2">confusion can create a lot of want for</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.830" end="00:08:26.320" style="s2">certainty we can look to certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.630" end="00:08:29.830" style="s2">ideologies or dogmas or things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.320" end="00:08:30.520" style="s2">comfort us a little bit and that can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.830" end="00:08:32.860" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.520" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">to a certain degree but really I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.860" end="00:08:42.580" style="s2">like the head is more its role is more</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:46.290" style="s2">to direct our attention think about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.580" end="00:08:48.520" style="s2">consequences of certain actions and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.290" end="00:08:50.530" style="s2">certain scenarios and what we should be</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.520" end="00:08:52.180" style="s2">doing but at the end of the day like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.530" end="00:08:55.780" style="s2">once we&#39;re ready to actually make a step</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.180" end="00:08:56.290" style="s2">and act it has to include the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.780" end="00:08:58.300" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.290" end="00:09:00.400" style="s2">and so if we get lost only in our heads</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.300" end="00:09:04.510" style="s2">we&#39;re going to feel quite aimless quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.400" end="00:09:06.960" style="s2">confused and and if we&#39;re resistant to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.510" end="00:09:09.460" style="s2">some of those elements - like confusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.960" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">it can actually create more of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.460" end="00:09:14.710" style="s2">process right you know one of the weird</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:19.090" style="s2">things that if we&#39;re running into</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.710" end="00:09:20.740" style="s2">challenging parts of our experience will</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.090" end="00:09:22.030" style="s2">usually find that the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.740" end="00:09:23.950" style="s2">resisting are the things that are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.030" end="00:09:27.160" style="s2">most present in our experience so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.950" end="00:09:28.600" style="s2">we&#39;re really resisting being uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.160" end="00:09:32.110" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a lot of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.600" end="00:09:34.060" style="s2">for really resistant being compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.110" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">toward others then we&#39;re going to feel a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.060" end="00:09:40.150" style="s2">lot of sorrow and if we&#39;re you know soso</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:42.520" style="s2">and if we&#39;re denying our survival</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.150" end="00:09:44.920" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s by being reckless or being</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.520" end="00:09:48.570" style="s2">running away from the problem or not</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:52.030" style="s2">taking it serious or any of those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.570" end="00:09:53.560" style="s2">yeah I can be can be tough so that being</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.030" end="00:09:55.770" style="s2">said so this that&#39;s kind of like a quick</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.560" end="00:09:58.060" style="s2">I tried to summarize I know it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.770" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">all over the place but hopefully you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.060" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2">the general sense of what its act like</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:07.060" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to act from each of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.100" end="00:10:09.220" style="s2">places and the key here being that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.060" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re moving forward I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.220" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">important to make sure that all of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:13.390" style="s2">are being considered all of them are</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:15.790" style="s2">part of the picture so not to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.390" end="00:10:17.830" style="s2">centered in one space so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.790" end="00:10:20.700" style="s2">kind of take a tour in this meditation</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.830" end="00:10:23.940" style="s2">of each of these areas</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.700" end="00:10:26.910" style="s2">and in the future you know if certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.940" end="00:10:28.980" style="s2">areas are you&#39;ve less contact with or</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:31.110" style="s2">there&#39;s some confusion around it those</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.980" end="00:10:33.780" style="s2">might be some some things to spend some</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.110" end="00:10:35.520" style="s2">time with in the mornings or nights or</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.780" end="00:10:36.690" style="s2">whenever you have some time it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.520" end="00:10:38.220" style="s2">have to be anything super formal you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.690" end="00:10:40.950" style="s2">just sit down and kind of get in touch</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.220" end="00:10:43.460" style="s2">with it and hopefully we can this whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.950" end="00:10:45.630" style="s2">two or give you a bit of an idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.460" end="00:10:48.390" style="s2">exploring some of those the sensations</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.630" end="00:10:49.890" style="s2">in that space are mm-hmm one little</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.390" end="00:10:53.850" style="s2">caveat here I would say is just to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.890" end="00:10:58.100" style="s2">sure that not to make sure but to strive</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.850" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">to notice when what we&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.100" end="00:11:03.510" style="s2">becomes less part of the focus and more</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:05.640" style="s2">about and it becomes more about labeling</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.510" end="00:11:07.190" style="s2">what it is so as soon as we start to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.640" end="00:11:09.840" style="s2">very conceptual about what we&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.190" end="00:11:11.940" style="s2">that might be a time to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.840" end="00:11:15.570" style="s2">we&#39;re getting lost in our head maybe get</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.940" end="00:11:16.620" style="s2">back down into our body and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.570" end="00:11:18.690" style="s2">really important to be able to process</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.620" end="00:11:22.650" style="s2">the stuff and to allow ourselves to feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.690" end="00:11:24.390" style="s2">fully from each of these spaces by by</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.650" end="00:11:26.130" style="s2">being with this in sensory experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.390" end="00:11:28.310" style="s2">and so not as much about the ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.130" end="00:11:31.380" style="s2">them at least when we&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.310" end="00:11:34.820" style="s2">reflection is good time afterwards a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.380" end="00:11:34.820" style="s2">good thing to do afterwards but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.740" end="00:11:42.280" style="s2">so yeah I think that&#39;s I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.170" end="00:11:44.650" style="s2">good kind of little foundation one kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.280" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">of quick little I guess</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.650" end="00:11:48.940" style="s2">disclaimer would be just that since we</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:50.430" style="s2">are going to be exploring some of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.940" end="00:11:53.080" style="s2">places that could be kind of sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.430" end="00:11:55.090" style="s2">if you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.080" end="00:11:58.030" style="s2">kind of like really dive into your</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.090" end="00:12:00.460" style="s2">emotions then maybe this isn&#39;t the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.030" end="00:12:01.630" style="s2">meditation at the time for you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.460" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.630" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">find I&#39;m sure right now calm is and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.560" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">bunch of other apps are available and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:15.910" style="s2">finding a more soothing soothing</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:17.020" style="s2">practice is very very easy so this one</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.910" end="00:12:19.570" style="s2">might be a little it could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.020" end="00:12:20.980" style="s2">challenging we could push us to go in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.570" end="00:12:23.230" style="s2">some areas that we might not be super</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.980" end="00:12:24.640" style="s2">comfortable with but I really do think</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.230" end="00:12:26.980" style="s2">this is what it&#39;s going to be required</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.640" end="00:12:38.200" style="s2">for us to act fully as we move forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.980" end="00:12:42.420" style="s2">so yeah all right so yeah it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.200" end="00:12:42.420" style="s2">we&#39;re just at 15 perfect</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.840" end="00:12:47.950" style="s2">just set a timer here</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.209" end="00:12:56.949" style="s2">just sit up nice and straight</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.100" end="00:12:59.829" style="s2">make sure your your spine both from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.949" end="00:13:04.449" style="s2">very crown of your head all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.829" end="00:13:06.459" style="s2">to your seat into the ground just try to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.449" end="00:13:11.579" style="s2">try and imagine it being as straight as</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.459" end="00:13:14.980" style="s2">humanly possible and that might mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.579" end="00:13:17.589" style="s2">your chin can fall forward a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.980" end="00:13:21.129" style="s2">more than usual might even feel like</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.589" end="00:13:23.800" style="s2">you&#39;re looking down a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.129" end="00:13:29.259" style="s2">really just keeping a very clear focus</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.800" end="00:13:34.600" style="s2">on that spine being straight now just</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.259" end="00:13:39.279" style="s2">take a couple deep breaths each breath</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.600" end="00:13:42.069" style="s2">kind of taking in our surroundings</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:44.920" style="s2">becoming aware of what is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.069" end="00:13:51.480" style="s2">this moment maybe even bringing some</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.920" end="00:13:59.290" style="s2">gratitude to it and then releasing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.480" end="00:14:02.549" style="s2">without any reservation completely so</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.290" end="00:14:06.429" style="s2">these breaths the spine becomes straight</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.549" end="00:14:14.019" style="s2">and then out we relax into our space</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.429" end="00:14:18.339" style="s2">into this moment now I would just start</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.019" end="00:14:20.259" style="s2">by just noticing any kind of tension in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.339" end="00:14:25.559" style="s2">our experience but we&#39;ll start at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.259" end="00:14:32.709" style="s2">top of our head maybe move down to our</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.559" end="00:14:36.100" style="s2">brow our eyes our nose mouth cheeks just</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.709" end="00:14:37.509" style="s2">notice if there&#39;s any any contraction</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.100" end="00:14:42.149" style="s2">here and see if there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.509" end="00:14:42.149" style="s2">can be relaxed a little bit deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.619" end="00:14:53.250" style="s2">moving on to the neck the shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.130" end="00:15:00.090" style="s2">the throat hmm a lot of tension gets</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.250" end="00:15:10.530" style="s2">held here a lot to be released down into</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.090" end="00:15:18.500" style="s2">our chest we&#39;re back mid back around to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.530" end="00:15:24.810" style="s2">our abdomen slowly settling down to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.500" end="00:15:38.420" style="s2">base of the stomach releasing as we move</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.810" end="00:15:48.440" style="s2">down its the hips at the but our legs</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.420" end="00:15:53.160" style="s2">thighs knees calves and do our ankles</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.440" end="00:15:58.500" style="s2">and our feet all the way down to our</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.160" end="00:16:01.560" style="s2">toes no just kind of get the sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.500" end="00:16:06.870" style="s2">gonna like we&#39;re not no intention to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:09.530" style="s2">moving we&#39;re just completely relaxed in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.870" end="00:16:09.530" style="s2">this moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.170" end="00:16:32.080" style="s2">now let&#39;s start to very gently focus in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.660" end="00:16:32.080" style="s2">a little bit closer in our stomach area</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.330" end="00:16:44.209" style="s2">it could be really deep it almost feels</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:45.860" style="s2">at the seat I almost knew our seat or it</p>

<p begin="00:16:45.860" end="00:16:53.270" style="s2">stomach or the top upper end just notice</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.860" end="00:16:56.220" style="s2">see if there&#39;s anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.270" end="00:16:58.110" style="s2">noticeable</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.220" end="00:16:59.760" style="s2">you said might even notice that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.110" end="00:17:03.450" style="s2">some tension there are some constriction</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.760" end="00:17:05.580" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t see the first time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.450" end="00:17:10.050" style="s2">just gonna try and let it be as the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.580" end="00:17:13.380" style="s2">natural version of itself maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.050" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">means we can just let our belly be as it</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.380" end="00:17:28.680" style="s2">is sometimes we hold it back notice if</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:33.090" style="s2">there&#39;s any movement and if there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.680" end="00:17:34.650" style="s2">any sensations that you&#39;ve noticed start</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.090" end="00:17:37.290" style="s2">to see if you can find the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.650" end="00:17:37.830" style="s2">them - like where do they where does it</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.290" end="00:17:41.070" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.830" end="00:17:43.550" style="s2">what is the constriction start where</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.070" end="00:17:43.550" style="s2">does it end</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:51.330" style="s2">we notice there&#39;s maybe some confusion</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.840" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">even around that question which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.330" end="00:18:03.860" style="s2">totally fine because there&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:18:05.690" style="s2">an answer here and if you do</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.860" end="00:18:09.470" style="s2">stuff getting lost in a thought at any</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.690" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">time just maybe send a little smile to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.470" end="00:18:14.420" style="s2">yourself laugh at your mind for getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:16.490" style="s2">distracted for a moment and very gently</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.420" end="00:18:25.040" style="s2">go back to that man</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.490" end="00:18:28.520" style="s2">abdomen see if anything&#39;s changed even</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.040" end="00:18:30.860" style="s2">if that&#39;s having a hard time finding</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.520" end="00:18:37.150" style="s2">something to pay attention to just the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.860" end="00:18:37.150" style="s2">looking in that area is very important</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.470" end="00:19:07.820" style="s2">now very slowly let&#39;s start to move</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.140" end="00:19:11.240" style="s2">closer to our heart let&#39;s see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.820" end="00:19:13.100" style="s2">find a center to it maybe it&#39;s just you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.240" end="00:19:16.010" style="s2">most of our sensation in our heart area</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.100" end="00:19:22.040" style="s2">is just kind of a the chest in general</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.010" end="00:19:27.610" style="s2">maybe you can feel there are more solid</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.040" end="00:19:27.610" style="s2">on the left side where it resides I</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.660" end="00:19:36.020" style="s2">start to do what we did in the gut and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.940" end="00:19:40.340" style="s2">by kind of surveying this whole chest</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.020" end="00:19:43.820" style="s2">Center trying to notice certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.340" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">constrictions we&#39;ve noticed that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.820" end="00:19:50.049" style="s2">been holding on to some breath that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.049" style="s2">can let go a little bit further</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:59.610" style="s2">a lot of movement in the chest very easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:08.190" style="s2">to follow</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.610" end="00:20:09.690" style="s2">we&#39;d be easier than the gut see if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.190" end="00:20:12.360" style="s2">can kind of like notice the difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.690" end="00:20:19.049" style="s2">between what the in breath now breath</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.360" end="00:20:23.070" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s a receiving quality to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.049" end="00:20:31.140" style="s2">the in breath almost a surrender on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.070" end="00:20:41.910" style="s2">out-breath it seems to be felt a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.140" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">that our area sometimes I can notice how</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.910" end="00:20:51.000" style="s2">solid the heart is maybe if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2">feeling a little lonely or something you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.000" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2">might even feel a little achy this here</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.980" end="00:21:06.620" style="s2">which is fine too</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.970" end="00:21:09.450" style="s2">maybe we allow that ache it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.620" end="00:21:17.460" style="s2">just crack open our heart a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.450" end="00:21:19.880" style="s2">so that it can radiate so it can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.460" end="00:21:19.880" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.400" end="00:21:31.420" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.809" end="00:21:52.100" style="s2">now let&#39;s slowly start bring your</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.380" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">attention up the throat up to the top of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.100" end="00:22:02.380" style="s2">the crown of the head see we can notice</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:08.679" style="s2">up here they even notice the space</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.380" end="00:22:08.679" style="s2">around the crown of the head the mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.950" end="00:22:15.470" style="s2">its natural state is actually quite open</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.059" end="00:22:22.870" style="s2">very different from the heart the heart</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.470" end="00:22:27.770" style="s2">was so solid grounded connected the mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.870" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a ton of boundaries it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.770" end="00:22:39.290" style="s2">almost like you could feel into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:43.220" style="s2">space around you just openness without</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.290" end="00:22:45.950" style="s2">any distinct quality maybe even some</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.220" end="00:22:55.160" style="s2">confusion comes with that when one is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.950" end="00:22:59.260" style="s2">openness but we realize like the more we</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.160" end="00:23:04.309" style="s2">allow this confusion to be as it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.260" end="00:23:08.290" style="s2">broader our awareness becomes you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.309" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">reach out in all directions above below</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.290" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">to the sides</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:33.240" style="s2">this open mind is what will allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.620" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">act completely our whole embodied self</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.240" end="00:23:41.140" style="s2">its attention must have an awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:46.600" style="s2">each one of these centers the survival</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.140" end="00:23:54.279" style="s2">of our gut the compassion and care of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.600" end="00:23:56.490" style="s2">our heart means the openness of our</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.340" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">you see if we can feel all of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.980" end="00:24:10.870" style="s2">everything we&#39;ve explored bring it all</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:15.910" style="s2">into our attention how&#39;s the gut</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.870" end="00:24:19.920" style="s2">informing the heart that was the mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.910" end="00:24:19.920" style="s2">providing the space between the two</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.960" end="00:24:55.210" style="s2">sometimes the mind might get pulled off</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.510" end="00:24:59.770" style="s2">into a thought and when that happens we</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.210" end="00:25:03.820" style="s2">just notice the space around it bring</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.770" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">back come back to the moment and see</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.820" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.090" end="00:25:25.610" style="s2">noticing how different it is to feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:46.820" style="s2">into our experience than it is to think</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.610" end="00:25:55.850" style="s2">about it the mind might even become very</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.820" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">small portion of our experience this</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.850" end="00:26:08.570" style="s2">moving breathing body feeling body</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:27.980" style="s2">there&#39;s so much information there step</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.570" end="00:26:32.710" style="s2">into if we&#39;re paying attention now as</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.980" end="00:26:37.700" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to wrap up here</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.710" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">now that we&#39;ve felt into the wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.700" end="00:26:48.530" style="s2">of our experience start to figure if we</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:51.910" style="s2">can somehow channel that experience like</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.530" end="00:26:58.180" style="s2">it like the heart is kind of gathering</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.910" end="00:26:58.180" style="s2">information from the whole picture and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.770" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">would it be like - maybe I want to be to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.700" end="00:27:10.390" style="s2">experience from our Art Center instead</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:10.390" style="s2">of our head</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.020" end="00:27:23.510" style="s2">maybe a call to connect with others to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.919" end="00:27:23.510" style="s2">help to be helped by others or ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.230" end="00:27:35.549" style="s2">now let&#39;s slowly as we&#39;re holding on to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.990" end="00:27:37.860" style="s2">this heart centered focus expressing</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.549" end="00:27:40.409" style="s2">ourselves through this heart center</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.860" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">slowly let a little bit of light into</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.409" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.360" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">keeping contact with that heart nope you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.490" end="00:27:58.300" style="s2">up a little bit more keeping our focus</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:27:58.300" style="s2">kind of soft</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.330" end="00:28:04.610" style="s2">looking more aware of our surroundings</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.330" end="00:28:06.670" style="s2">but experiencing it through the art</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.610" end="00:28:06.670" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.970" end="00:28:22.330" style="s2">knew you&#39;d open our eyes all the way Wow</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.580" end="00:28:27.400" style="s2">concentration or focus to go wherever it</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.330" end="00:28:30.510" style="s2">wants but feeling like it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.400" end="00:28:30.510" style="s2">directed by heart</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:43.460" style="s2">we can even put our hands on our chests</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.200" end="00:28:45.620" style="s2">over our heart just feel into it a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.460" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">little bit more just become acquainted</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.620" end="00:29:04.250" style="s2">with it no I think that as we move</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">forward we can keep the totality of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.250" end="00:29:11.630" style="s2">experience in hand and when we act act</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:17.870" style="s2">from this sense of compassion in</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.630" end="00:29:24.710" style="s2">connection maybe even some sorrow or</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.870" end="00:29:35.830" style="s2">sadness that calls us to compassion as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.710" end="00:29:35.830" style="s2">purpose they&#39;re not separate all right I</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.460" end="00:29:50.210" style="s2">guess as we move forward I guess I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.000" end="00:29:51.650" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s just a reminder of if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.210" end="00:29:55.010" style="s2">find ourselves getting focused in one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.650" end="00:29:58.429" style="s2">those areas and remember maybe one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.010" end="00:30:00.110" style="s2">those areas is not very available it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.429" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">might be a good trigger for us even</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.110" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">during the day to just kind of bring our</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:12.490" style="s2">attention to more than one space so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:12.490" style="s2">can act from a very broad perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.350" end="00:30:18.400" style="s2">thanks for uh thanks for going on this</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.410" end="00:30:24.330" style="s2">little exploration</p>
