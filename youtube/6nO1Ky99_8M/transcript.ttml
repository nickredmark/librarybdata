<p begin="00:00:15.200" end="00:00:19.940" style="s2">done a series of conversations with a</p>

<p begin="00:00:24.620" end="00:00:31.850" style="s2">and Peterson and the recent debate I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.790" end="00:00:34.910" style="s2">an admirer of both men for different</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.850" end="00:00:37.339" style="s2">reasons last year I wrote a short piece</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.910" end="00:00:41.140" style="s2">where I defended Peterson again against</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.339" end="00:00:43.550" style="s2">she checks rather shallow critique</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.140" end="00:00:45.769" style="s2">however over time I&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.550" end="00:00:49.519" style="s2">developing a critique of Peterson and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.769" end="00:00:52.850" style="s2">have renewed interest in jiseok so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.519" end="00:00:54.800" style="s2">started binging on Gees exFAT philosophy</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.159" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">called total recoil and also read living</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.989" end="00:01:09.320" style="s2">in the end times I liked his titles very</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:15.049" style="s2">much anyway shortly after - or journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.320" end="00:01:17.450" style="s2">into Dziedzic the Peterson revolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.049" end="00:01:22.010" style="s2">hit and I spend a great deal of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.450" end="00:01:23.560" style="s2">thinking and writing about the dangerous</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:17.850" style="s2">ignore most of the the politics let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:20.880" style="s2">start with the end of the debate I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.850" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">gonna go backwards here and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.880" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">concluding remarks so Peterson ended on</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">a quite an optimistic note he said he</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:33.480" style="s2">was hoping that he would that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2">would leave the debate with a belief in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.480" end="00:02:38.540" style="s2">the power of communication between</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">people of different views</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">Ziza on the other hand was much less</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:50.730" style="s2">rosy he hoped to shatter people a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:53.330" style="s2">one to stir the pot so both men have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.730" end="00:02:57.110" style="s2">professed pessimism</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.330" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">although Peterson is less pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">and the fact that Jesus is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">philosophical pessimist makes him a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">strange kind of Marxist which Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:14.870" style="s2">pointed out in the debate since Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:14.870" style="s2">is often about creating a utopian future</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.830" end="00:03:20.670" style="s2">another thing which is interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.780" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">note and I&#39;ve written about this before</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.670" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">is the physical energetic differences</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">between the two men some people might</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">think that body language isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:33.900" style="s2">relevant subject but how we present</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:36.500" style="s2">herself might have something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.900" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">our philosophy might be may be related</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.500" end="00:03:42.410" style="s2">so Z Zack has the body language of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:45.330" style="s2">kind of a gesture the fool the idiot</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.410" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2">he&#39;s always twitching and sniffing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.330" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">just sticky leading him sometimes going</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.850" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">into this fetal position he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:58.519" style="s2">like a character actor he uses his</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:02.459" style="s2">bodily tics for you know comedic</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.519" end="00:04:04.110" style="s2">rhetorical purposes the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.459" end="00:04:06.540" style="s2">the clown can say more than the ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.110" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">person can say because he is an outsider</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.540" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">and Peterson&#39;s persona is strikingly</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">different he&#39;s the Protestant preacher</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">the gentleman</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:20.180" style="s2">the person can very concern was saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">just the right word</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.180" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">he never stutters so you have zis Act</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:35.100" style="s2">the court jester and Peterson though the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">old-fashioned preacher somewhat which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.100" end="00:04:43.400" style="s2">a nice dynamic so Peterson is very still</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:48.930" style="s2">and poised he&#39;s he&#39;s elegant he&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.400" end="00:04:51.210" style="s2">whereas he&#39;s Equis mannequin he was he</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.930" end="00:04:53.820" style="s2">has a sort of trademarks accent and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.210" end="00:05:01.470" style="s2">stuttering and I was thinking that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.820" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">is like order meeting chaos Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.470" end="00:05:08.700" style="s2">all about order jisuk is all about chaos</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">on some level which isn&#39;t to say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.700" end="00:05:18.419" style="s2">Ziza is not capable of being orderly but</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:20.340" style="s2">he likes to be provocative and say odd</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.419" end="00:05:22.169" style="s2">strange things rather than keep to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.340" end="00:05:27.780" style="s2">script in fact he was never on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.169" end="00:05:31.760" style="s2">script during this debate and I also was</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.780" end="00:05:38.870" style="s2">thinking that beneath Peterson&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.760" end="00:05:45.690" style="s2">cool not cool very proper demeanor</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.870" end="00:05:47.910" style="s2">there&#39;s some shadowy elements so in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.690" end="00:05:49.110" style="s2">first piece about Peterson and Susak I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.910" end="00:05:51.660" style="s2">wrote about the communication</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.110" end="00:05:53.540" style="s2">differences between the two men I said</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.660" end="00:05:59.160" style="s2">that Peterson is a good listener</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.540" end="00:06:00.780" style="s2">music doesn&#39;t listen he monologues but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.160" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">like the fact that Z Zach doesn&#39;t put on</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.780" end="00:06:07.110" style="s2">airs or pretend to lower himself to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:08.280" style="s2">the usual you know bullshit whereas</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.110" end="00:06:10.830" style="s2">Peterson on the other hand is very</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.280" end="00:06:16.110" style="s2">magnanimous always very available to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.830" end="00:06:18.930" style="s2">audience as a clinical psychologist he</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.110" end="00:06:21.030" style="s2">makes an effort to listen and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:25.020" style="s2">this is the secret to his power as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.030" end="00:06:26.729" style="s2">healer and even a priest of sorts you</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.020" end="00:06:28.770" style="s2">heal people by listening to their</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.729" end="00:06:31.830" style="s2">stories which is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.770" end="00:06:33.509" style="s2">psychoanalysis is about more or less but</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.830" end="00:06:34.949" style="s2">his basic argument is that by</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.509" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">strengthening the individual you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.949" end="00:06:40.819" style="s2">strengthen the community which</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:40.819" style="s2">strengthens the world clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.879" end="00:06:44.759" style="s2">these that made the point however that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:47.099" style="s2">you know you could also tell the North</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.759" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">Korean to to clean his room and be very</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.099" end="00:06:52.949" style="s2">orderly and treat his family well and be</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:55.560" style="s2">a nice kind of docile system but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.949" end="00:07:00.870" style="s2">obviously something more to the human</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.560" end="00:07:04.550" style="s2">spirit than that but Peterson is quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.870" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">right to say that in order to really</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.550" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">help the world we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:13.169" style="s2">what&#39;s intimate what&#39;s near the too much</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.259" style="s2">social justice activity all this social</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.169" end="00:07:18.569" style="s2">justice stuff is lacking a certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.259" end="00:07:21.870" style="s2">hard-nosed pragmatism and intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.569" end="00:07:23.969" style="s2">of wisdom of depth that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.870" end="00:07:27.870" style="s2">important to develop our character and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.969" end="00:07:30.509" style="s2">all that so what I&#39;m gonna argue here</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.870" end="00:07:33.750" style="s2">however is that this is limited that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.509" end="00:07:38.150" style="s2">individualistic philosophy is a lonely</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.750" end="00:07:42.659" style="s2">Street it has its particular limits and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.150" end="00:07:44.550" style="s2">also it&#39;s an ideology so zis exposition</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.659" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">is that everything is an ideology you</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">know he gave the example of German</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.319" end="00:07:52.770" style="s2">toilets they&#39;re an expression of German</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:58.529" style="s2">ideology and then this just is to tell</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.770" end="00:08:01.229" style="s2">us how very deep ideology goes so</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.529" end="00:08:04.349" style="s2">perhaps Peterson&#39;s anti ideology is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.229" end="00:08:07.830" style="s2">actually the ideology of liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.349" end="00:08:11.849" style="s2">individualism I think it sees like has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.830" end="00:08:15.659" style="s2">point here you have to constantly refine</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.849" end="00:08:19.259" style="s2">and create ideology an ideology means</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.659" end="00:08:21.509" style="s2">literally just the science of ideas so</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.259" end="00:08:23.009" style="s2">there&#39;s ideological possession and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.509" end="00:08:27.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a conscious way of creating</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.009" end="00:08:29.819" style="s2">ideology but it turned out that ideology</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.930" end="00:08:34.500" style="s2">is usually work used in a very negative</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.819" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">sense well in my first piece I was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.500" end="00:08:40.690" style="s2">unfair towards eASIC I called him a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:44.980" style="s2">postmodernist but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.690" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">so very critical of this lack of a grand</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.980" end="00:08:50.140" style="s2">narrative and post-modernism the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:55.930" style="s2">idealization of the marginal person and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.140" end="00:08:57.940" style="s2">all that and some people have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.930" end="00:09:05.890" style="s2">calling jejak just like they called</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.940" end="00:09:08.920" style="s2">peterson Eurocentric zis ik is very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.890" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">into theory you could say he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.920" end="00:09:15.550" style="s2">theory is very important Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:17.290" style="s2">very into pragmatism so you could say</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.550" end="00:09:19.830" style="s2">that Jesus is more let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.290" end="00:09:22.620" style="s2">philosopher a pure philosopher and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.830" end="00:09:24.700" style="s2">Peterson is more like a hands-on</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.620" end="00:09:28.150" style="s2">psychologist you know in the school of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.700" end="00:09:31.350" style="s2">Jung and Freud and all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.150" end="00:09:37.030" style="s2">he&#39;s his concern is changing people</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.350" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">directly in a very direct way so so in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.030" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">way that this is one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:43.720" style="s2">Peterson makes people so upset is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:46.330" style="s2">like he like you made people very upset</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.720" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">is that he&#39;s so pragmatic and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.330" end="00:09:54.190" style="s2">straightforward that DIAC it drives the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:57.220" style="s2">academics crazy because their academics</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.190" end="00:09:59.050" style="s2">right so on one hand we have Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.220" end="00:10:02.850" style="s2">emphasizing the individual and on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.050" end="00:10:07.410" style="s2">other hand we have Dziedzic emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.850" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">no social bureaucracy and collectivism</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.410" end="00:10:12.900" style="s2">so this brings me to my friend and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:16.300" style="s2">co-conspirator Alexander bard</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.900" end="00:10:18.940" style="s2">was clearly articulated this and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.300" end="00:10:25.270" style="s2">helping me make a somewhat of a friendly</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.940" end="00:10:27.790" style="s2">critique of both men in bards book the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.270" end="00:10:30.940" style="s2">netic rats which is a great book by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:33.730" style="s2">way he speaks of trends and counter</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.940" end="00:10:36.670" style="s2">trends so counter trends are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.730" end="00:10:39.070" style="s2">what the fallback position when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.670" end="00:10:41.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have a vision to the future the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.070" end="00:10:44.350" style="s2">counter trend here might be nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.080" end="00:10:46.390" style="s2">or traditionalism you know in the face</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.350" end="00:10:47.710" style="s2">of the trend of globalism so the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.390" end="00:10:51.190" style="s2">is becoming more and more global so</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.710" end="00:10:55.480" style="s2">people become more and more reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.190" end="00:10:58.569" style="s2">so this is perhaps why Peterson is so</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.480" end="00:11:00.639" style="s2">conservative he&#39;s falling back into</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.569" end="00:11:02.980" style="s2">let&#39;s say Western individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.639" end="00:11:04.389" style="s2">maybe a Cold War sort of Red Scare</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.980" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">rhetoric which doesn&#39;t mean that he</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.389" end="00:11:07.930" style="s2">hasn&#39;t beautifully and correctly</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">described the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.930" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">totalitarianism only his remedy might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.170" end="00:11:22.629" style="s2">not complete so collectivists and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">individualists pathologies will</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.629" end="00:11:29.439" style="s2">certainly arise in the future but they</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:34.689" style="s2">won&#39;t be the same in the internet age we</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.439" end="00:11:37.060" style="s2">need some other kind of diagnosis so</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.689" end="00:11:39.310" style="s2">interestingly Bart considers himself not</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.060" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">a socialist or a liberal not a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.310" end="00:11:45.300" style="s2">collectivist or an individualist but</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:48.009" style="s2">rather a communist which is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.300" end="00:11:51.430" style="s2">heretical word especially to Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.009" end="00:11:55.649" style="s2">and his gang and I&#39;d rather say</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.430" end="00:12:00.519" style="s2">communalist but for him it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.649" end="00:12:04.300" style="s2">reintegrating the tribal communal life</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.519" end="00:12:06.189" style="s2">and the fact that tribalism is so deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.300" end="00:12:10.180" style="s2">inside of us you know and we need a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.189" end="00:12:15.069" style="s2">healthy version of the tribe of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.180" end="00:12:19.300" style="s2">commune so perhaps the question of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.069" end="00:12:20.769" style="s2">happiness or rather deep meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.300" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">fulfillment it&#39;s not about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.769" end="00:12:26.380" style="s2">individual it&#39;s about finding one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:31.389" style="s2">place of maximum meaning in a community</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.380" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">and Bart makes the point and this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.389" end="00:12:34.120" style="s2">somewhat of a Buddhist point as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:39.880" style="s2">that there is no such thing as an</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.120" end="00:12:41.860" style="s2">isolated atomic individual per se most</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.880" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">of the deeper spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.860" end="00:12:49.959" style="s2">arrive at this point as well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:53.800" style="s2">social beings we have communal needs and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.959" end="00:12:55.180" style="s2">we don&#39;t exist apart from that so again</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.800" end="00:12:59.699" style="s2">it&#39;s not the Petersons would deny this</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.180" end="00:12:59.699" style="s2">only it&#39;s not emphasized in his thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.970" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">also on</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.310" end="00:13:08.180" style="s2">to capitalism erich fromm who was one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:13.699" style="s2">the frankfurt school people he wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.180" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">book called to have her to be so in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.699" end="00:13:18.949" style="s2">capitalist society it&#39;s all about having</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:22.839" style="s2">where&#39;s the meaningful existence we</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.949" end="00:13:25.339" style="s2">search for we look for resides in being</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.839" end="00:13:29.899" style="s2">so yes it&#39;s important to develop the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.339" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">individual but it&#39;s being in the team</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.899" end="00:13:37.309" style="s2">that we thrive so you can only be happy</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:39.019" style="s2">and even if this is a rather lame idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.309" end="00:13:41.509" style="s2">just you know the purpose of life to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.019" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">happy is all the existentialist point</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.509" end="00:13:50.449" style="s2">out it&#39;s not a goal in itself but</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:52.249" style="s2">well-being etc is is maybe only possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.449" end="00:13:55.519" style="s2">in the larger family the larger tribe</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.249" end="00:14:00.949" style="s2">and this is the critique of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:14:03.110" style="s2">individualism we&#39;re making here so</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.949" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">Nietzsche might be the the champion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.110" end="00:14:07.990" style="s2">19th century individualism just as Marx</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:11.389" style="s2">was the champion of 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.990" end="00:14:15.379" style="s2">collectivism but Nietzsche ended up</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.389" end="00:14:19.269" style="s2">alone and we all know where what happens</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.379" end="00:14:23.470" style="s2">when society becomes too collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.269" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">Peterson has spoken about that in length</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:27.459" style="s2">but the problem is according to bard</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:31.759" style="s2">that neither of these two people have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.459" end="00:14:34.910" style="s2">vision of the future or a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.759" end="00:14:39.019" style="s2">theory that&#39;s why they both tend towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.910" end="00:14:41.059" style="s2">conservatism gzx defense of social</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.019" end="00:14:43.540" style="s2">democracy and a controlled free market</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.059" end="00:14:46.040" style="s2">mechanism it&#39;s not revolutionary and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.540" end="00:14:49.429" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s conservatism isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.040" end="00:14:51.620" style="s2">radical form of conservatism so Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.429" end="00:14:57.319" style="s2">is a moderate conservative and Dziedzic</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.620" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">is a moderate leftist the politics are</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.319" end="00:15:04.850" style="s2">the least interesting part of these two</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:07.550" style="s2">men&#39;s thinking as I&#39;ve already said so</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.850" end="00:15:09.800" style="s2">if you want to really get behind you</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.550" end="00:15:11.689" style="s2">know Peterson and Dziedzic you need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.800" end="00:15:15.160" style="s2">know where they come from who their</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.689" end="00:15:15.160" style="s2">masters were who they study</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.570" end="00:15:24.840" style="s2">so it&#39;s G Zack its Hagel on Lacan you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.390" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">know both very interesting characters</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.840" end="00:15:31.390" style="s2">and for Peterson its Nietzsche and yo so</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">if you want to know about their</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.390" end="00:15:39.490" style="s2">worldviews you know read Hegel and Lacan</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:43.180" style="s2">and Nietzsche and yo so why are these</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.490" end="00:15:45.220" style="s2">men important despite the critiques we</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.180" end="00:15:49.570" style="s2">might have they are the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.220" end="00:15:54.790" style="s2">philosophers the people have elected</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.570" end="00:15:58.270" style="s2">them so to speak they&#39;re popular not</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.790" end="00:16:02.920" style="s2">through votes or book marketing or any</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.270" end="00:16:05.170" style="s2">of that it&#39;s all you know their massive</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.920" end="00:16:06.370" style="s2">popularity is all word of mouth which</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.170" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">means that they&#39;re responding to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.370" end="00:16:10.450" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually happening and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:15.550" style="s2">we need more of these popular</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.450" end="00:16:16.150" style="s2">philosophers popular philosophers with</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.550" end="00:16:22.150" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.150" end="00:16:23.470" style="s2">rather than pop philosophers so both men</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.150" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">have proved that there is a mass</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.470" end="00:16:28.840" style="s2">interest in in thinking right that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:32.650" style="s2">are thinking creatures we need to think</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.840" end="00:16:35.800" style="s2">our way through these things and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.650" end="00:16:39.460" style="s2">don&#39;t just want ideological cliches or</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.800" end="00:16:44.050" style="s2">television sound bites there&#39;s a hunger</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.460" end="00:16:46.210" style="s2">for thought and both men show that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.050" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">the the subculture is it&#39;s become bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.210" end="00:16:50.100" style="s2">than the dominant culture in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:52.690" style="s2">YouTube has become bigger than TV</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.100" end="00:16:54.990" style="s2">Digital has become bigger than broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.690" end="00:16:57.430" style="s2">and digital is a two-way conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.990" end="00:17:01.180" style="s2">right broadcast is just a one-way</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.430" end="00:17:07.010" style="s2">conversation so this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.180" end="00:17:10.040" style="s2">creative chaotic times and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.010" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">the Atheist puts it the Holy Spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.040" end="00:17:19.150" style="s2">arising so without being too religious</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:21.740" style="s2">let&#39;s just say that the Holy Spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.150" end="00:17:24.790" style="s2">generative intelligence its intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.740" end="00:17:28.100" style="s2">it&#39;s bright intelligence which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.790" end="00:17:29.870" style="s2">transforming of people it&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.100" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2">Instagram it&#39;s beyond marketing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.870" end="00:17:35.480" style="s2">beyond effects</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:37.460" style="s2">it&#39;s beyond well there&#39;s a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.480" end="00:17:39.309" style="s2">called Harry Frankfurt and calls it</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.460" end="00:17:42.169" style="s2">bullshit it&#39;s beyond bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.309" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">so these akin Peterson are very great</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.169" end="00:17:50.330" style="s2">anti bullshit personalities I think and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:53.210" style="s2">even if they differ in their analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.330" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">what the bullshit is they&#39;ve brought a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.210" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">new authenticity to the conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">contrary to what Peterson people often</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">say about Peterson he&#39;s a he&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.910" end="00:18:15.950" style="s2">something much deeper I&#39;d say he&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.780" end="00:19:06.140" style="s2">than good so we need to be as Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.770" end="00:19:09.950" style="s2">and G&#39;s Eck are critical of these victim</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.140" end="00:19:14.660" style="s2">and cults critical of the alt right or</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.660" end="00:19:20.280" style="s2">real social injustice is obviously so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.150" end="00:19:23.640" style="s2">what about their writing</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.280" end="00:19:25.560" style="s2">um I think zzg check excuse me Alice its</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.640" end="00:19:27.870" style="s2">Dziedzic I think Dziedzic is a better</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.560" end="00:19:29.340" style="s2">writer he has more sort of flow in</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.870" end="00:19:32.490" style="s2">spontaneity in this writing</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.340" end="00:19:33.990" style="s2">he writes faster and that&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.490" end="00:19:36.620" style="s2">that Peterson isn&#39;t a good writer he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.990" end="00:19:40.050" style="s2">just very compressed and perfectionistic</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.620" end="00:19:43.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s his first book last meeting it</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.050" end="00:19:45.150" style="s2">is a tough read he he writes and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.320" end="00:19:46.920" style="s2">rewrites every sentence hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.150" end="00:19:48.110" style="s2">times which makes it very dense and hard</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.920" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">to penetrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.110" end="00:19:55.310" style="s2">whereas jejak is very prolific and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:20:00.540" style="s2">I guess he&#39;s more free in his expression</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.310" end="00:20:02.220" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to critique twelvers for</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.540" end="00:20:04.790" style="s2">life but it&#39;s it&#39;s a peripheral book</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.220" end="00:20:07.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not a important book whereas I</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.790" end="00:20:10.830" style="s2">think master meanings is an important</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.290" end="00:20:12.780" style="s2">book I think twelvers rules for life was</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.830" end="00:20:15.930" style="s2">perhaps written too hastily for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.780" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">publisher even if it is a great you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.930" end="00:20:23.220" style="s2">popular self health manual you can get</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:26.610" style="s2">all that from Peterson&#39;s lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:29.990" style="s2">everything is in maps and meaning maps</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.610" end="00:20:33.930" style="s2">in meaning his was written in blood</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.990" end="00:20:36.420" style="s2">so Nicci&#39;s phrase so even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.930" end="00:20:38.130" style="s2">imperfect it has it has the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.420" end="00:20:40.260" style="s2">Peterson in it so it&#39;s I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.130" end="00:20:41.970" style="s2">important book so hopefully Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.260" end="00:20:44.040" style="s2">will write another major book but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.970" end="00:20:48.420" style="s2">think maybe he put everything that one</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.040" end="00:20:49.530" style="s2">book it&#39;s not a criticism and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.420" end="00:20:52.950" style="s2">that he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.530" end="00:20:55.890" style="s2">embodying this Guttenberg revolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.950" end="00:20:59.790" style="s2">that he talks about where the spoken</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.890" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">word matters so back to the debate this</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.790" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">debate was never about happiness or</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:10.260" style="s2">liberalism versus Marxism and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:14.730" style="s2">thinking that that&#39;s because that debate</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.260" end="00:21:18.350" style="s2">is old old hat classic liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.730" end="00:21:24.300" style="s2">Orthodox Marxism are not important</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.350" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">except as historical systems we need new</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.300" end="00:21:31.400" style="s2">imaginative vocabulary for the social</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:31.400" style="s2">and economic dynamics today</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.879" end="00:21:35.749" style="s2">and I&#39;m with my friend Alexander Bart on</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.069" end="00:21:42.169" style="s2">this that we have to come up with a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.749" end="00:21:45.949" style="s2">grand narrative and we can use marks we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.169" end="00:21:48.769" style="s2">can reinvent him without becoming insane</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.949" end="00:21:51.949" style="s2">collectivists and there&#39;s a new sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.769" end="00:21:53.599" style="s2">dynamic and class struggle between what</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.949" end="00:21:56.599" style="s2">he calls the netic rats and the consume</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.599" end="00:22:01.059" style="s2">arias the hidden people behind the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.599" end="00:22:04.129" style="s2">internet and the people who just consume</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.059" end="00:22:07.369" style="s2">so that all that&#39;s to say that the rules</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.129" end="00:22:11.049" style="s2">of the game had have shifted so in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.369" end="00:22:14.299" style="s2">debate both men agree that liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.049" end="00:22:17.719" style="s2">won the war of the 20th century one that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.299" end="00:22:21.289" style="s2">ideological war but the question then</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.719" end="00:22:26.419" style="s2">remains is has the dynamic now shifted</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.289" end="00:22:30.619" style="s2">are we in the age of eminent ecological</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.419" end="00:22:34.190" style="s2">collapse do we have to think of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.619" end="00:22:37.509" style="s2">development in a different way do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.190" end="00:22:43.249" style="s2">have to rethink communalism or communism</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.509" end="00:22:46.729" style="s2">you know of some sort and living</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.249" end="00:22:48.289" style="s2">together in a different way and in order</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.729" end="00:22:51.769" style="s2">to be Christian you&#39;re part of a</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.769" end="00:22:56.659" style="s2">church just like if you&#39;re a Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.289" end="00:23:01.309" style="s2">here you&#39;re part of the Buddhist Sangha</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.659" end="00:23:05.659" style="s2">you know you go and gather together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.309" end="00:23:07.459" style="s2">not a lonely individualist enterprise so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.659" end="00:23:10.219" style="s2">if you were talking about Buddhist lingo</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.459" end="00:23:11.719" style="s2">which I&#39;m particularly familiar with you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.219" end="00:23:13.639" style="s2">could say Peterson gets the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.719" end="00:23:20.199" style="s2">Buddha and Dharma but not the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.639" end="00:23:26.289" style="s2">Sangha and the nuclear family is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.199" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">it&#39;s not the human unit it&#39;s a very new</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:34.789" style="s2">faults pathologies and I think today</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.109" end="00:23:37.399" style="s2">we&#39;re searching for different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.789" end="00:23:39.469" style="s2">being together and we need a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.399" end="00:23:41.329" style="s2">congregation we need a song I forgot to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.469" end="00:23:44.039" style="s2">talk about religion you can&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.329" end="00:23:47.429" style="s2">religion without talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.039" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">life so eight billion sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.429" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">individuals is a pretty lost world so</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:56.940" style="s2">anyway what I&#39;m arguing here is that a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:59.609" style="s2">Peterson perhaps is too much of an</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.940" end="00:24:00.989" style="s2">apologist for individualism and Zedek</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.609" end="00:24:04.409" style="s2">perhaps is too much of an apologist</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.989" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">apologist for collectivism the point is</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.409" end="00:24:12.450" style="s2">both men don&#39;t have a grand narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:16.830" style="s2">and what is the grand narrative and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.450" end="00:24:18.690" style="s2">they should the grand narrative be we</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.830" end="00:24:20.519" style="s2">are creating narratives we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.690" end="00:24:21.720" style="s2">grand narratives all the time and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.519" end="00:24:24.859" style="s2">one of the grand narratives we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.720" end="00:24:29.700" style="s2">creating is a sort of doomsday fatalism</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.859" end="00:24:31.979" style="s2">related to ecology and a kind of zombie</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.700" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">consumerist nihilism and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.979" end="00:24:35.489" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of narratives social</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:38.820" style="s2">you know collective narratives being</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.489" end="00:24:42.919" style="s2">created and perhaps we need something</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.919" end="00:24:47.700" style="s2">which is very different than the 20th</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.289" end="00:25:23.509" style="s2">we will call it car Marx</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.629" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">it was badly treated by Peterson he</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.220" end="00:25:32.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t show a great knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:35.610" style="s2">of Marx and if you&#39;re arguing against</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.070" end="00:25:38.460" style="s2">Marx perhaps you need to you need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.610" end="00:25:42.869" style="s2">study him a bit more deeply and not just</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.460" end="00:25:45.059" style="s2">the people who hate him and we could</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.869" end="00:25:50.460" style="s2">also say that is Marx and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.059" end="00:25:53.519" style="s2">Peterson adores Nietzsche Ameche</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.460" end="00:25:56.359" style="s2">inspired Hitler to a great degree does</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.519" end="00:26:02.850" style="s2">that mean that Nietzsche is the devil</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.359" end="00:26:04.759" style="s2">so if Marx inspired Stalinism does that</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.850" end="00:26:09.379" style="s2">mean Marx as the devil I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.759" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">maybe Hitler misread Nietzsche and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.379" end="00:26:17.879" style="s2">Mao and Stalin misread Marx so what with</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:20.399" style="s2">Marx maybe we have to separate the wheat</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.879" end="00:26:22.889" style="s2">from the chaff to use Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.399" end="00:26:25.769" style="s2">favorite expression maybe we have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.889" end="00:26:28.859" style="s2">read these thinkers properly rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.769" end="00:26:31.649" style="s2">just straw Manning them in a polemical</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.859" end="00:26:33.029" style="s2">way so Peterson is masterful at showing</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.649" end="00:26:36.409" style="s2">the pathological elements of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.029" end="00:26:40.259" style="s2">post-modernism and the worst parts of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.409" end="00:26:42.989" style="s2">Marxism but he&#39;s Manichaean right here</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.259" end="00:26:44.389" style="s2">he won&#39;t grant much truth value he says</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.989" end="00:26:47.009" style="s2">he&#39;ll give the devil his due</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.389" end="00:26:49.350" style="s2">but he&#39;s still saying the devil is still</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.009" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">saying it&#39;s the devil right so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.350" end="00:26:55.669" style="s2">to be a very manichaean argument of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.279" end="00:26:58.440" style="s2">absolute good versus absolute evil</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.669" end="00:27:01.379" style="s2">rather than a view beyond good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.440" end="00:27:05.489" style="s2">right which is based more on on</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.379" end="00:27:11.429" style="s2">pragmatism which is based on ethics</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.489" end="00:27:13.859" style="s2">maybe Marx also saw a few things like he</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.429" end="00:27:17.009" style="s2">actually saw communal societies</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.859" end="00:27:19.649" style="s2">developing in England in Germany he</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.009" end="00:27:23.119" style="s2">definitely didn&#39;t promote revolution in</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.649" end="00:27:27.029" style="s2">feudal states like China and Russia in</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.119" end="00:27:29.909" style="s2">the 19th century so then the question so</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.029" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">the question becomes you know also why</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.909" end="00:27:34.470" style="s2">you know what about the negative aspects</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:35.610" style="s2">of capitalism like mass alienation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.470" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">depression and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.610" end="00:27:42.090" style="s2">all these different psychosis is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.950" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">the you know the system of late</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.090" end="00:27:46.980" style="s2">capitalism engenders so Peterson doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:49.800" style="s2">have this critique of linked capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.980" end="00:27:52.710" style="s2">and its predatory kind of economics and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.800" end="00:27:54.510" style="s2">all the environmental rapaciousness you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.710" end="00:27:59.730" style="s2">know he hasn&#39;t been able to show that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.510" end="00:28:02.280" style="s2">this risk economy as may be running out</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.730" end="00:28:03.860" style="s2">of steam so what kind of system do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.280" end="00:28:10.610" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.860" end="00:28:15.900" style="s2">well nonzero-sum game non-rival</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.610" end="00:28:19.560" style="s2">cooperative economics you know animated</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.900" end="00:28:23.270" style="s2">by a grand narrative one thing is for</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.560" end="00:28:27.180" style="s2">sure we don&#39;t need bloody revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.270" end="00:28:30.390" style="s2">we don&#39;t need post-modernism postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.180" end="00:28:33.030" style="s2">relativism and yes we needed values</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.390" end="00:28:35.070" style="s2">decades of values and yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.030" end="00:28:38.040" style="s2">something above and below us unlike what</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.070" end="00:28:41.720" style="s2">John Lennon said so we need to look up</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.040" end="00:28:46.140" style="s2">to somebody in something and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.720" end="00:28:51.630" style="s2">understand that we&#39;re part of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2">larger story oh I&#39;m with Peterson on</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.630" end="00:28:58.740" style="s2">that Peterson also admits that there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:29:00.570" style="s2">unjust hierarchies so we could say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.740" end="00:29:03.680" style="s2">maybe the movement in history towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.570" end="00:29:03.680" style="s2">egalitarianism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.880" end="00:29:09.690" style="s2">is a good thing and Petersen doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:10.980" style="s2">have this particular gala terrine of his</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.690" end="00:29:13.750" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.980" end="00:29:15.850" style="s2">even if he&#39;s totally correct to say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.750" end="00:29:17.620" style="s2">equality of opportunity is what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.850" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">should be aiming at and not equality of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.620" end="00:29:27.670" style="s2">outcome I had another thought which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:29.800" style="s2">provocative and I thought is who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.670" end="00:29:32.650" style="s2">revolutionary here who was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.800" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">hot-headed revolutionary is a Dziedzic</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.650" end="00:29:38.110" style="s2">or Peterson again perhaps Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:40.930" style="s2">hatred of marks indicate indicates this</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.110" end="00:29:46.690" style="s2">sort of intimacy with Marxist ideas</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.930" end="00:29:49.930" style="s2">perhaps he comes from the left and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.690" end="00:29:54.060" style="s2">reacting against Marx but he&#39;s got some</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.930" end="00:29:54.060" style="s2">left is you know qualities him</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.500" end="00:30:00.169" style="s2">so he&#39;s the he&#39;s the leader of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:01.240" style="s2">revolutionary of the proletariat so to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.169" end="00:30:04.630" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.240" end="00:30:07.400" style="s2">lifting up working-class men everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.630" end="00:30:10.030" style="s2">and jejak on the other hand is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.400" end="00:30:13.909" style="s2">elitist you know he&#39;s a burgeois elitist</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.030" end="00:30:15.799" style="s2">and he&#39;s a bit of a conservative he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.909" end="00:30:18.650" style="s2">critical of progressive movements even</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.799" end="00:30:21.590" style="s2">while he supports them and he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.650" end="00:30:23.320" style="s2">apologist for Christianity which he uses</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.590" end="00:30:25.940" style="s2">the greatest moral system of all time</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.320" end="00:30:30.130" style="s2">which is not exactly what you would</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.940" end="00:30:32.510" style="s2">think your average Marxist revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.130" end="00:30:36.429" style="s2">who thinks that religion is the opiate</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.510" end="00:30:36.429" style="s2">of PEEP of the people what would think</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.490" end="00:30:41.720" style="s2">Peterson wants to change the world he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.900" end="00:30:44.330" style="s2">out to change the world one person at a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.720" end="00:30:46.190" style="s2">time I don&#39;t know if I could make a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.330" end="00:30:50.409" style="s2">sustained argument the Peterson as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.190" end="00:30:50.409" style="s2">Marxist and Susak is a conservative but</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.470" end="00:30:57.559" style="s2">as a thought experiment and provocation</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.659" end="00:30:59.330" style="s2">maybe it works a little bit the point is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.559" end="00:31:02.270" style="s2">there&#39;s this shadowy negation of each</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.330" end="00:31:06.049" style="s2">affirmation of a belief this is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.270" end="00:31:11.419" style="s2">this is what Lacan is about I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.049" end="00:31:16.039" style="s2">I don&#39;t know certainly it&#39;s what Carl</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.419" end="00:31:17.390" style="s2">Jung and the shadow is about so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.039" end="00:31:20.659" style="s2">is that the part of yourself that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.390" end="00:31:25.299" style="s2">rejected that you despise that you hate</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.659" end="00:31:30.110" style="s2">may be animating you to a certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.299" end="00:31:32.630" style="s2">and so then maybe music is a closeted</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.110" end="00:31:35.270" style="s2">conservative and Peterson is a closeted</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.630" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">Marxist in any case I love both these</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.270" end="00:31:42.070" style="s2">men I think they embodied the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:44.780" style="s2">the time I think they&#39;re very honest and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.070" end="00:31:49.340" style="s2">they&#39;re not beholden to media companies</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.780" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">which is so refreshing and Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.340" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">honest enough to talk about virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:56.380" style="s2">character and all the old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:59.299" style="s2">values and Dziedzic is honest enough to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.380" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">confess his perversions and be</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.299" end="00:32:07.809" style="s2">unpolitical e correct and both are</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:10.719" style="s2">attacking this shallow moralizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.809" end="00:32:14.349" style="s2">which is great so a good thinker has to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.719" end="00:32:17.649" style="s2">be offensive to Dogma and ruffle</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.349" end="00:32:19.960" style="s2">feathers you know jejak ruffles Noam</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.649" end="00:32:22.229" style="s2">Chomsky&#39;s feathers which makes me think</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.960" end="00:32:25.090" style="s2">Noam Chomsky is a bit of a Puritan</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.229" end="00:32:27.629" style="s2">at Peterson is you know offensive to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.090" end="00:32:30.340" style="s2">lot of people on the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.629" end="00:32:35.769" style="s2">you know the church people love him and</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.340" end="00:32:39.969" style="s2">hate him the social justice warriors to</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:50.469" style="s2">there&#39;s people on the Left who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.450" end="00:32:52.809" style="s2">probably closet Peter Sohn Ian&#39;s like me</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.469" end="00:32:57.190" style="s2">but I haven&#39;t been in the closet I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.809" end="00:33:00.099" style="s2">just been saying so again hallelujah</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.190" end="00:33:03.249" style="s2">these men are out there we need these</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.099" end="00:33:08.519" style="s2">fights and Wars of intellect not of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.249" end="00:33:12.549" style="s2">actual worse the more more people talk</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.549" end="00:33:18.609" style="s2">Society and it&#39;s great that these events</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.339" end="00:33:20.700" style="s2">are big like sporting events you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.609" end="00:33:23.109" style="s2">it&#39;s raising the level of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.700" end="00:33:25.359" style="s2">and I think both men have this great</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.109" end="00:33:27.789" style="s2">sense of humor especially Dziedzic and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.359" end="00:33:32.649" style="s2">we need to have a sense of humor above</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.789" end="00:33:36.219" style="s2">all we need to flirt and joke and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.649" end="00:33:39.070" style="s2">know sometimes talk dirty and not fear</p>
