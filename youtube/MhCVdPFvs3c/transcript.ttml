<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">question from mark welcome as always</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">mark</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">how are contemplation and savoring</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">related are they the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">or do you overlap does one require there</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">are other specific practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">differences so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">i think of contemplation and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">as basically attentional</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">where we&#39;re directing our attention and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">contemplation is seeing through</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">where savoring has more to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.520" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">opening up affectively with an a affect</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">right affectively opening up your</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">um so that there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">more uh coming in through sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">and more coming in so more coming in</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">through imagination</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">more coming in from imagination the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">perception the pre-hending</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:09.919" style="s2">more sight more insight etc</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">and so i suppose that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.919" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">there could be savoring i hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">about this question i hadn&#39;t really put</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">it together</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">um taxonomically so that&#39;s why i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">through this carefully</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">i suppose though that savoring is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">both within meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">because you can be opening up right</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">making the flow of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">you&#39;re getting into the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">intelligibility more</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">and you could be doing that inwardly</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">directed in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">outwardly directed in contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">so i think savoring</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">is more basic practice in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">that it gets us into</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">a joy filled conformity</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">with the being with being and that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">that being of course can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">unfolding within in meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">in contemplation or with all</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">in prajna and so this</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">traditionally a state of bliss</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">associated with the non-duality of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">prajna and that would make sense given</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">what we&#39;re we&#39;re working through</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">together now because</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">the bliss would be not the savoring</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">of not meditative savoring or</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">contemplative savoring</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">but the savoring of non-duality sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">pure being</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">pure savoring of pure being so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">how i think i would try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">put those together i think more</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">reflection theoretical reflection</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">is needed on that um but</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">yeah i mean the problem with it is of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">course is that attention and awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">are bound and interpenetrate each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:02.840" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">consciousness um but yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">yeah uh annotation contemplation seem to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">directional and that brings in attention</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">whereas savoring seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">awareness it seems to be sensitizing</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">and sensing the flow of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">victoria it&#39;s good to see you victoria</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">how do how often do i practice</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">imagining and then we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">about the fact that stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">is not downward there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">imagination and there&#39;s a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">specific version of the practice they</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">get an</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">object that they really like they spend</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">time with it they develop affection for</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">it and then they</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">uh break it um as a way and so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is practicing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">uh in countering so pre-meditation ahead</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">you know thinking about but also</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">meditating upon ahead of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">loss um so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">do it that often in the sense of doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">it with specific</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">people but i do tend to do it</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">um daily and that i have</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">a reflection in which i consider the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:51.039" style="s2">fatality of all things</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">and i don&#39;t consider it just</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.039" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">intellectually i meditate on it i really</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">let it</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">resonate in in into me</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">how all things</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">have an</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">a permanent their existence isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">permanent but they</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">as long as they exist there&#39;s an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">that is forever independent from</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">my narratives my project uh the meanings</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">of my life so i do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">on a fairly regular basis pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">almost a daily basis</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">i found that seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">to be i i i think this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">personality difference so i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">recommending it in general</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">i think that version of the practice for</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">me seems to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">it it seems to grab me more than the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:46.400" style="s2">individual ones that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">tend to be emotionally startling</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">but they don&#39;t tend to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">orient me towards the general sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">but i can readily i readily acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">that i could see it being completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">reversed for other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">that doing the more specific version of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">the pre-meditation</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">could really be powerfully symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">of uh the fatality of all things at</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">so i hope that answered your question</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:16.640" style="s2">victoria um</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">it made me reflect maybe i should go</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">back to the more specific practice more</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">regularly for a while</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:24.399" style="s2">and and see give it a taste and a driver</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">again for a while</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.399" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">kiera kroger uh hi kyra observation</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">i i regularly have felt the experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">of contraction in my body and then i</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:36.000" style="s2">mentally recoil from the contraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">during yoga today on discord i realized</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">that i can breathe into the contraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">like it would breathing into a stretch</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:44.399" style="s2">in yoga that felt</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">insufficient that&#39;s very good so yoga of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">course means ultimately to yoke</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">conjugal it&#39;s the off it&#39;s to be wedded</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s to be coupled</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">do that if we can couple to body armor</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">in the way you&#39;re describing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">very powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a very powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">befriending yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">of coming into a deeper wedding to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">himself and i don&#39;t mean in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">narcissistic oh i&#39;m so wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">unique and special and the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:18.399" style="s2">here just for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">and all that um what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.399" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">is you know that what we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">about throughout the befriending of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">oneself</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:30.880" style="s2">so i carry a lot of body armor here</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">on the left side of my body some of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">sort of uh historical psychodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">trauma</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">some of it has to do with the ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">sense that there is a part of my brain</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">that&#39;s hyper vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">about the uh the meniere&#39;s in my left</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">ear and of course i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">ignore it because it&#39;s always ringing</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">there&#39;s always the pain and the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">uh and so moving</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">doing exactly we&#39;re talking about care</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">moving into that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">that contraction and that resistance um</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">the way it rebounds and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">befriending the way it rebounds into</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">put into sort of concrete terms but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">a very powerful experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s it goes from being uh</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very powerful experience so</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">i&#39;m glad that you are getting a taste of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">and i encourage you to continue to</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">as a way of befriending yourself</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">this feeling of oneness seems at odds</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">with the concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">of countries and modern life uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">that being at odds is is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">so one thing to do is to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">embrace that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">that there&#39;s a see</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">countries are extensions of egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">um orientation um you know my</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">country our country you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s that um and of course we need</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">countries et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">i&#39;m not some sort of crypto anarchist at</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">least i don&#39;t think i am</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">um but when you get to the meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">and that all falls away and it&#39;s odd</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">what&#39;s what what&#39;s your what your</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">recognizing what you&#39;re recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">what&#39;s coming into awareness</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">is that that way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">isn&#39;t actually part of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">things the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">countries and the divisions um and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">what seemed</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">natural and habitual and inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">is disclosed to being conventional</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">uh constructed and malleable that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">evil or illusory that&#39;s a mistake that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">people too often leap to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">oh because it&#39;s changeable and malleable</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s therefore it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">so coming to the awareness</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">that that mode</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t the same thing as the order of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">things is a profound thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">so giving all of that is hopefully an</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">affordable context</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">savor the sense of the oddness meditate</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">raha jonas question i captured myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:31.279" style="s2">recently paraphrasing some facts while</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.279" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">or adding some individual uniqueness to</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">to be mindful of my speech</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">do you think this is enough for now to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">um you yeah definitely um</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">yeah remember don&#39;t hold yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">harsh perfectionism but to virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:55.919" style="s2">um but yes i i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">setting the intent but perhaps setting</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.919" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">it through the day um</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s good to pick one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">the promises and make that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">going to especially pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">uh throughout the day um</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">but i think could be like celebrate that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">so the the temptation uh when we note</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">these things is to ah</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">right but instead say oh great i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">starting to do it</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">i&#39;m starting to become more mindful of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:25.279" style="s2">my speech i&#39;m starting to realize i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">doing these things for a while</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">just be satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">take that cautiously be satisfied with</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">just catching it</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">and noticing it and then what will</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">happen is is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">and just encourage it and wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">good and encourage it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">and keep doing it and keep looking for</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">it and make it a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">a pleasurable experience a learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">not one that&#39;s reflecting on your</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">uh your character but one that is</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">and and and then after you&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">a more reliable sense of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">catch that and witness it</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">then try to catch it earlier</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">like you know how we like when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">right and and try and catch it earlier</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">and earlier increase your sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:26.079" style="s2">and then you get to a place where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">caught it early enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">that you stare around it and it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">scale sitting head practices i&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">um clear on</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">what the last thing is referring to but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">i have a sense of what your question is</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">so they that so the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">um this is something i talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">the uh the series</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">awakening for the media crisis there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">the problem we we face two extremes that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">we want to get away from</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:46.480" style="s2">impulsivity in which we just act on</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">impulse</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.480" end="00:35:53.280" style="s2">um velman calls this being a wanton</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">like like wanton behavior and frankfurt</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">uses a similar idea and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">impulsivity is it works at cross</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">purposes it works against itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">and so we lose agency and so we practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">forms of reflection and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">and we withdraw from action into</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">and what we get is we get some space and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">some freedom</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">from that impulsivity and we start to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">organize our impulses so that they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:23.680" style="s2">not at cross purposes and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">we reduce our inner conflict but you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.680" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">withdraw too much</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">in which you are the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">the reflection is upon reflect like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:33.920" style="s2">can get to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">and development talks about like hamlet</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.920" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">as this</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">masterful work of art about a person who</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">is so reflecting upon his reflections of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">his reflections</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">uh that he has disconnected himself</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">from the machinery of agency he so</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">uncoupled himself</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">that he can&#39;t get a momentum</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">of action going he becomes um withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">warned about a similar thing in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">use meditation as a form of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">bypassing and we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">spiritual bypassing in which what</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is it is is to escape</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.839" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">into kind of the contentedness of like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">cabbage</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">or or a clot of earth uh because</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">um they have so withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">from the connection and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">the idea is right that we want</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">and and it&#39;s a oil i&#39;ll be a canadian</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">and i will find</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">the uh the average point the middle</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">point between them</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">and the problem is that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">either so what you need is a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:44.160" style="s2">uh constantly shifting you need</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.160" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">brings with it the flexibility of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:55.680" style="s2">but the coupling contact</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">of impulsivity and this is where taoism</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">especially helpful although</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">stoicism and epicureanism can help us</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">out here as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">because taoism argues for</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">something between reactivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">wanton and the reflexivity of the hamlet</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">and so between reactivity and uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">over and too much reflexivity is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:23.280" style="s2">they call spontaneity</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">so when you&#39;re when you&#39;re acting</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.280" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">spontaneously you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">awareness um you have a coherence</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">and you have a flexibility to your</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">but it is still engaged and coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">um and spontaneity of course is a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">of activating and accentuating and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">in some senses accelerating the flow</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">experience that we&#39;re all capable of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.440" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">and part of what these practices are</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">doing in general this is not the only</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">thing they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">but part of what they are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">taking the flow experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">and increasing our cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">and our cognitive power such that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">scope and the depth of flow</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">opens up broadly stephen baxter in fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">argues</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">that he proposes that the buddha&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">is to be comprehensively in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">and this seems very similar to what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">taoist sages</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">are so what you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">is is uh toggle between</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">toggle your practices and you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">they have a compensatory relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">so you&#39;re constantly moving between</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:47.440" style="s2">uh right the extremes of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">automatic uh reflexivity and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:54.040" style="s2">and you know overly um active uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry reactivity and overactive</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.040" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">reflexivity</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:40:02.160" style="s2">and so you&#39;re trying to steer between</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">them and get the optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.160" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to get that and expand</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">that optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">so that capacity to flow becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">and more um</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">a way of life and a way of being so i</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">hope that was helpful</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">and i look forward to more questions and</p>
