<p begin="00:00:08.429" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">available in 11 languages and in my book</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.420" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">I said that we were on a wild roller</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">coaster of a ride and that we would</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">first see the threat of deflation</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:24.320" style="s2">followed by a helicopter drop and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">would be followed by big inflation and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.320" end="00:00:30.929" style="s2">that has happened there was the 2008</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">crisis we&#39;re seeing the base money</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.929" end="00:00:34.950" style="s2">around the planet being hyper inflated</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">right now while all of the credit</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.950" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">aggregates are collapsing and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:42.930" style="s2">sort of netting out to zero inflation or</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:45.149" style="s2">just slightly positive to inflation even</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">though base money around the planet is</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.149" end="00:00:49.350" style="s2">just taking off like a rocket but it</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">would then be followed by a real</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">deflation and then followed by</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:54.510" style="s2">hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">so I think it sort of looks like this</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.510" end="00:00:59.430" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the markets going up in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">real estate bubble in 2007 and then we</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:04.460" style="s2">had the threat of deflation which was</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">the 2008 market crash and a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.460" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">helicopter drop of currency and you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">here and then I think that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.460" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">into something like this and it will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.549" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">followed by the world&#39;s central bank&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">hyperinflation there isn&#39;t any time that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">I can find in all of history where a</p>

<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:37.799" style="s2">what has to happen is that you go into a</p>

<p begin="00:01:37.799" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">foreclose and the public in general is</p>

<p begin="00:03:36.700" end="00:03:42.790" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been predicting since 2005 is</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.190" end="00:03:44.440" style="s2">playing out right before our eyes one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.790" end="00:03:46.390" style="s2">the things I really like about speaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.440" end="00:03:48.820" style="s2">of live events is the chance to interact</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.390" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">with people and sort of get my finger on</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.820" end="00:03:53.740" style="s2">the pulse of what they&#39;re thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:56.530" style="s2">lately it&#39;s become pretty obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.740" end="00:04:00.040" style="s2">for a lot of people it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.530" end="00:04:01.960" style="s2">grasp why I think deflation is coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:04.180" style="s2">before big inflation or even</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.960" end="00:04:06.160" style="s2">hyperinflation so here I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.180" end="00:04:09.100" style="s2">break down four of the biggest reasons</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.160" end="00:04:12.040" style="s2">that I see deflation coming first the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.100" end="00:04:14.860" style="s2">first one is simple the overreaction to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.040" end="00:04:22.510" style="s2">the 2008 crisis has caused a credit debt</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.860" end="00:04:24.640" style="s2">bubble and all bubbles pop so I talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.510" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">about hyper inflating base money this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.640" end="00:04:29.890" style="s2">this is hyperinflation right here</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:32.350" style="s2">inflation and deflation is either an</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.890" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">expansion or contraction of the currency</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.350" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">supply and prices follow the inflation</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">or deflation eventually now most of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:43.180" style="s2">currency does not circulate it sitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:43.630" style="s2">on banks balance sheets and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.180" end="00:04:46.660" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.630" end="00:04:49.930" style="s2">excess reserves you know if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.660" end="00:04:52.750" style="s2">the years leading up to this crisis this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.930" end="00:04:54.730" style="s2">red line is reserve balances the white</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.750" end="00:04:57.100" style="s2">line is how much of it is excess and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.730" end="00:04:59.710" style="s2">here we have Alan Greenspan&#39;s response</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.100" end="00:05:03.310" style="s2">to 9/11 look at the scale of how big</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.710" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">this emergency is compared to 9/11 but</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.310" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">what is Ben Bernanke afraid of and now</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:10.540" style="s2">Janet Yellen has inherited this legacy</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:13.780" style="s2">well one of the things that happened in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.540" end="00:05:15.310" style="s2">the 2008 crisis is that banks froze up</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.780" end="00:05:16.660" style="s2">and wouldn&#39;t lend to each other they</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.310" end="00:05:17.320" style="s2">were all scared to lend to each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.660" end="00:05:19.690" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.320" end="00:05:21.490" style="s2">system is such a fraud that at the end</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.690" end="00:05:23.770" style="s2">of each day they all have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:25.930" style="s2">borrow digits from each other that were</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.770" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">created from nothing just to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.930" end="00:05:30.670" style="s2">whole smoke-and-mirrors game going they</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:33.610" style="s2">all have to do this interbank lending to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.670" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">keep things balanced well if one bank</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.610" end="00:05:37.090" style="s2">won&#39;t lend to another and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:39.190" style="s2">have any reserves the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.090" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">freezes up now if you&#39;ve got all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.190" end="00:05:42.640" style="s2">excess reserves that are on their</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:44.950" style="s2">balance sheet and they pay them interest</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.640" end="00:05:47.080" style="s2">to keep the reserves there and not use</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.950" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">this as a basis of fractional reserve</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.080" end="00:05:53.290" style="s2">lending they&#39;re going to be liquid this</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:55.540" style="s2">basically prevents bank runs by banks on</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.290" end="00:05:57.580" style="s2">banks it&#39;s not a public bank run with</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.540" end="00:06:00.670" style="s2">the the public lining up at the doors</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.580" end="00:06:03.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a bank run where one bank is trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.670" end="00:06:06.010" style="s2">to get their currency out of another or</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.430" end="00:06:08.980" style="s2">won&#39;t lend to another and so this keeps</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.010" end="00:06:11.230" style="s2">things liquid right now what this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.980" end="00:06:13.990" style="s2">done though the banks get to use this</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.230" end="00:06:16.120" style="s2">stuff in the middle of the day and so</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:33.220" style="s2">better in the short term and but when</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.819" end="00:10:36.069" style="s2">it&#39;s over you have to go through a detox</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.220" end="00:10:45.939" style="s2">as they would call it a debt detox and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.069" end="00:10:47.560" style="s2">that&#39;s where you get deflation this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.939" end="00:10:50.740" style="s2">the demographics of the United States</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.560" end="00:10:52.809" style="s2">back in the year nineteen forty and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:10:55.240" style="s2">broken into five year age groups and</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:06.040" style="s2">scenario and we&#39;re also in this swing</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.040" end="00:11:11.709" style="s2">is a pendulum a cycle that just goes</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.170" end="00:11:34.600" style="s2">beginning of that baby boom taking off</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.500" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">1960 1970 and this wave now the reason</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.690" end="00:13:45.339" style="s2">going to go back again and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.850" style="s2">that that maximum social burden group</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.330" end="00:14:11.330" style="s2">market boom of the 90s and all the way</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.070" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">but now after the year 2000 we got 2010</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.730" end="00:16:28.980" style="s2">at this time in history and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.090" end="00:16:31.290" style="s2">main topic of my most recent book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.980" end="00:16:33.450" style="s2">why I call it a demographic cliff this</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.290" end="00:16:35.100" style="s2">is the first time in most wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.450" end="00:16:37.320" style="s2">countries there&#39;s a few exceptions let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.100" end="00:16:39.890" style="s2">call it Sweden Switzerland and Australia</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.320" end="00:16:43.320" style="s2">countries like that they&#39;d have a larger</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.890" end="00:16:45.720" style="s2">millennial or echo boom but almost every</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.320" end="00:16:48.180" style="s2">other country has an echo boom that only</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.720" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">comes up near the same height or is much</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.180" end="00:16:53.250" style="s2">smaller than this echo boom here is when</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:55.080" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about so so my question</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.250" end="00:16:57.270" style="s2">to people is what hat like you say it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.080" end="00:17:00.360" style="s2">a pyramid each generation has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.270" end="00:17:02.190" style="s2">larger and more wealthy to help pay off</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.360" end="00:17:04.170" style="s2">the debts or their or the accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.190" end="00:17:06.690" style="s2">from from an aging generation before</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.170" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">them what happens when the millennial is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.690" end="00:17:10.500" style="s2">having to support a generation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:12.030" style="s2">actually larger than them and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.500" end="00:17:14.040" style="s2">happens when there&#39;s not enough for them</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.030" end="00:17:16.470" style="s2">to drive house prices back I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.040" end="00:17:19.380" style="s2">model now for housing it says people</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.470" end="00:17:22.380" style="s2">spend the most on housing at age 41 but</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.380" end="00:17:24.810" style="s2">then when they die at age 79 or 80 on</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.380" end="00:17:27.240" style="s2">average they become sellers so I have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.810" end="00:17:29.580" style="s2">subtract the dyers from the buyers and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.240" end="00:17:31.110" style="s2">when I do that baby boomers are going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.580" end="00:17:32.430" style="s2">be dying at higher rates than the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.110" end="00:17:33.750" style="s2">Millennials going to be buying at some</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.430" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">point there&#39;s gonna be net negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.750" end="00:17:36.930" style="s2">demand for housing everybody think oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:39.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be more housing for them</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.930" end="00:17:42.420" style="s2">no not when a smaller generation follows</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.240" end="00:17:46.380" style="s2">a larger so for entitlements that&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.420" end="00:17:48.420" style="s2">there is no way this next generation in</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.380" end="00:17:50.760" style="s2">the US and there&#39;s a lesson Japan or</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.420" end="00:17:52.620" style="s2">Europe where they&#39;re much smaller can</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.760" end="00:17:54.980" style="s2">even hope to pay the entitlements in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.620" end="00:17:57.930" style="s2">pharmacy baby boom is a fairy tale and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.980" end="00:18:01.170" style="s2">housing will never be the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.930" end="00:18:03.150" style="s2">we saw the Bob Hope generation come out</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.170" end="00:18:04.890" style="s2">of World War two the first middle-class</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.150" end="00:18:06.300" style="s2">generation history where the average</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.890" end="00:18:07.890" style="s2">person could buy a house on a mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.300" end="00:18:09.690" style="s2">that was not the case in the Roaring</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.890" end="00:18:12.120" style="s2">Twenties even only the fluence could do</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.690" end="00:18:13.650" style="s2">that so that was a big boom for housing</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.120" end="00:18:16.170" style="s2">housing went out to depression my way</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.650" end="00:18:17.190" style="s2">then the baby boom comes unprecedented a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.170" end="00:18:20.110" style="s2">number</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.190" end="00:18:21.990" style="s2">all of our lifetimes housings gone up</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.110" end="00:18:24.910" style="s2">with a few exceptions here in them</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.990" end="00:18:27.130" style="s2">housing is going to do well to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.910" end="00:18:29.350" style="s2">sideways for the coming decades</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.130" end="00:18:31.390" style="s2">nevertheless go a lot much again because</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.350" end="00:18:38.920" style="s2">of this generational shift we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.390" end="00:18:41.020" style="s2">seen this in history so now that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.920" end="00:18:43.960" style="s2">covered three of the major components</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.020" end="00:18:46.450" style="s2">for deflation I wanted to show you one</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.960" end="00:18:48.760" style="s2">of the real big E&#39;s here and this one is</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.450" end="00:18:51.100" style="s2">the convergence of cycles there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.760" end="00:18:53.620" style="s2">whole bunch of cycles the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.100" end="00:18:55.810" style="s2">the wealth distribution cycle and I want</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.620" end="00:18:58.260" style="s2">to use my own family as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.810" end="00:19:01.000" style="s2">demonstration of this this is my father</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.260" end="00:19:03.160" style="s2">he&#39;s right here he&#39;s about the age where</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.000" end="00:19:05.110" style="s2">he enlisted in the army to fight in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.160" end="00:19:07.150" style="s2">world war ii he fought in the Battle of</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.150" end="00:19:13.450" style="s2">liberated Dachau here he is in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.180" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">mid-50s he was manager of an auto parts</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:20.770" style="s2">equipment and here&#39;s his tax return from</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.760" end="00:19:22.450" style="s2">1955 this would have been he would have</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.450" end="00:19:27.430" style="s2">half after I was born and so what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.630" end="00:19:30.670" style="s2">see here is that he&#39;s a store manager in</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.430" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">Salem Oregon and his income was about 96</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:44.680" style="s2">only paid twelve percent because he</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:49.030" style="s2">didn&#39;t make very much so he&#39;s in a</p>

<p begin="00:20:26.590" end="00:20:29.830" style="s2">he&#39;s making a</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.169" end="00:21:03.219" style="s2">end of the roaring 20s it was above</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.219" end="00:21:08.859" style="s2">was going to the top 1% of the income</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.719" end="00:21:17.169" style="s2">but it&#39;s back up to 20 percent and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.049" end="00:21:21.339" style="s2">you know in this area the middle class</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.169" end="00:21:24.940" style="s2">was doing better but and paying less</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.149" end="00:21:36.519" style="s2">deflationary painful thing this we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.419" end="00:21:38.739" style="s2">already seen the baby boom demographic</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.519" end="00:21:41.739" style="s2">but I just need to show you one thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.739" end="00:21:43.809" style="s2">here you recall that the maximum</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.739" end="00:21:47.619" style="s2">spending gamma demographic drives the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.809" end="00:21:49.299" style="s2">economy the maximum social burden puts</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.619" end="00:21:51.309" style="s2">deflationary pressure on the economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.299" end="00:21:53.559" style="s2">they sell their stocks bonds and real</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.309" end="00:21:56.830" style="s2">estate to survive and they don&#39;t produce</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.559" end="00:21:59.799" style="s2">anything but what I want to point out is</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.830" end="00:22:02.469" style="s2">that there&#39;s about six times more people</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.799" end="00:22:04.929" style="s2">driving the economy here in 1940 than</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.469" end="00:22:07.599" style="s2">there are putting deflationary pressure</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.929" end="00:22:10.570" style="s2">on it and when you watch this wave go</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.599" end="00:22:12.580" style="s2">through the drivers are always more</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.570" end="00:22:14.649" style="s2">until just the last couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.580" end="00:22:16.179" style="s2">here and now the people putting</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.649" end="00:22:18.339" style="s2">deflationary pressure on the economy</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.179" end="00:22:20.739" style="s2">exceed the number of people driving the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.339" end="00:22:23.320" style="s2">economy so if you could chart this out</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.739" end="00:22:25.929" style="s2">with time on that axis and the energy</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.320" end="00:22:27.700" style="s2">going into the economy on this axis the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.929" end="00:22:29.950" style="s2">curve would probably look something like</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.700" end="00:22:33.489" style="s2">this and I believe that we are right</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.950" end="00:22:35.710" style="s2">about here right about now and now for</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.489" end="00:22:38.409" style="s2">the next cycle in this big convergence</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.710" end="00:22:42.969" style="s2">the stock market cycle this is the S&amp;P</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.409" end="00:22:45.639" style="s2">500 p/e ratios a p/e ratio is the price</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.969" end="00:22:48.009" style="s2">of a stock per share divided by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.639" end="00:22:50.679" style="s2">annual earnings of that company per</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.679" end="00:22:57.070" style="s2">between 10 to 14 times annual earnings</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.399" end="00:23:00.519" style="s2">that&#39;s fair value anything under 10 is</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.070" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">undervalued 14 to 20 is overvalued and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.519" end="00:23:05.289" style="s2">anything over 20 is bubble territory and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:08.169" style="s2">here comes the data and what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.289" end="00:23:10.389" style="s2">important here is that when the stock</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.169" end="00:23:13.450" style="s2">market goes into a bubble without</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.389" end="00:23:16.200" style="s2">exception it has to visit undervalued</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.450" end="00:23:19.570" style="s2">before a new bull market can begin</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.200" end="00:23:21.820" style="s2">except for this time the bubble biggest</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.570" end="00:23:23.109" style="s2">bubble in history in the year 2000 and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.820" end="00:23:25.299" style="s2">when it popped</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.109" end="00:23:27.609" style="s2">we went down to fair value and bounced</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.299" end="00:23:29.799" style="s2">back up into a bubble do you really</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.609" end="00:23:31.979" style="s2">think that a new bull market can begin</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.799" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">from here that we&#39;re not going to visit</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.979" end="00:23:37.599" style="s2">extreme under valuations I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:40.179" style="s2">so I think that we have to visit extreme</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.599" end="00:23:43.029" style="s2">under valuations before a new solid bull</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.179" end="00:23:44.979" style="s2">market can begin and now for probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.029" end="00:23:47.639" style="s2">the biggest factor in this convergence</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.979" end="00:23:50.349" style="s2">of cycles this is Nikolai Kondratiev</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.639" end="00:23:52.179" style="s2">he&#39;s a Russian economist that Lenin</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.349" end="00:23:54.489" style="s2">commissioned to prove that capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.179" end="00:23:56.289" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work he went away for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.489" end="00:23:58.749" style="s2">of years to do his studies and came back</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.289" end="00:24:00.369" style="s2">with his findings the capitalism was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.749" end="00:24:02.710" style="s2">superior system and would work</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.369" end="00:24:05.049" style="s2">marvelously well but it would always</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.710" end="00:24:07.539" style="s2">suffer from these long wave boom bust</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.049" end="00:24:10.179" style="s2">cycles to which he gave the names of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.539" end="00:24:13.389" style="s2">seasons of spring summer autumn and</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.179" end="00:24:16.269" style="s2">winter we&#39;ll come back to this in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.389" end="00:24:18.369" style="s2">other episode and and really dig into it</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.269" end="00:24:21.369" style="s2">but for now what you need to know is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.369" end="00:24:23.320" style="s2">that the winter is the deflationary</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.369" end="00:24:26.079" style="s2">season the last winter was the Great</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.320" end="00:24:28.149" style="s2">Depression and they used to call this</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.079" end="00:24:31.149" style="s2">the 50-year cycle but lately it&#39;s gotten</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.149" end="00:24:33.219" style="s2">stretched out and takes longer I believe</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.149" end="00:24:35.619" style="s2">that it&#39;s got to be the length of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.219" end="00:24:39.190" style="s2">human lifetime and the reason is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.619" end="00:24:42.070" style="s2">the winter is deflationary and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.190" end="00:24:45.609" style="s2">people that were old enough to be of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.070" end="00:24:49.869" style="s2">working age and have young families that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.609" end="00:24:52.509" style="s2">lost the house lost their job lost the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.869" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">family farm they become very emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.509" end="00:24:55.820" style="s2">scar</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:59.420" style="s2">and they become very risk-averse and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.820" end="00:25:01.640" style="s2">very very frugal and in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.420" end="00:25:04.070" style="s2">all the same stupid mistakes that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.640" end="00:25:06.500" style="s2">made in the roaring 20s that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.070" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">Great Depression that generation has to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.500" end="00:25:11.350" style="s2">die off well they have died off and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:14.990" style="s2">have made all the same stupid mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.350" end="00:25:17.420" style="s2">so this is very deflationary should it</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.990" end="00:25:19.790" style="s2">happen and here&#39;s the supporting</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.420" end="00:25:21.710" style="s2">evidence this is interest rates and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.790" end="00:25:25.550" style="s2">you see here is that they go right along</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.710" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">with the cycle this is wholesale prices</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.550" end="00:25:29.300" style="s2">in the US and again they go right along</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:31.430" style="s2">with the cycle until the point the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.300" end="00:25:34.790" style="s2">Federal Reserve decides that what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.430" end="00:25:37.190" style="s2">really need is constant inflation this</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.790" end="00:25:38.720" style="s2">is one of the biggest cycles of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.190" end="00:25:41.900" style="s2">hard for people to see though this</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:44.210" style="s2">east-west cycle takes about 500 years</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.900" end="00:25:47.810" style="s2">for the pendulum to swing each direction</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.210" end="00:25:51.170" style="s2">and 500 years back it&#39;s innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.810" end="00:25:54.950" style="s2">prosperity swinging from asia to europe</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.170" end="00:25:58.540" style="s2">and north america and back and in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.950" end="00:26:02.360" style="s2">dark ages china was developing gunpowder</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.540" end="00:26:05.020" style="s2">then china stagnated well we had the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.360" end="00:26:08.600" style="s2">industrious onson Industrial Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.020" end="00:26:10.910" style="s2">so ingenuity and prosperity does flow</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.600" end="00:26:13.280" style="s2">back and forth and right now you should</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.910" end="00:26:15.470" style="s2">be able to feel that the Western</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.280" end="00:26:17.720" style="s2">economies are stagnating and have sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.470" end="00:26:20.060" style="s2">of stalled while the growth in the Asian</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.720" end="00:26:22.930" style="s2">economies over the last 20 years has</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.060" end="00:26:25.910" style="s2">been mind-boggling and so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.930" end="00:26:27.530" style="s2">deflationary for the West and here is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.910" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">probably one of the most deflationary</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.530" end="00:26:32.150" style="s2">cycles of all this is household debt is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.110" end="00:26:34.040" style="s2">a percentage of disposable income and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.150" end="00:26:36.860" style="s2">the alarm bells should really be going</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.040" end="00:26:38.900" style="s2">off when people owe more than their</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.860" end="00:26:41.450" style="s2">disposable income anytime this exceeds</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.900" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">100 percent but I believe that this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.450" end="00:26:46.370" style="s2">also a cycle and that if we had data if</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:49.130" style="s2">we could go back further it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.370" end="00:26:51.080" style="s2">probably look like this and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.130" end="00:26:53.960" style="s2">interesting is that this reflects the</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.850" end="00:27:51.710" style="s2">going to implode and here&#39;s the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.730" end="00:27:54.410" style="s2">that that is going to be happening with</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.710" end="00:27:57.230" style="s2">the convergence of all of these cycles</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.410" end="00:27:59.960" style="s2">we have the east-west cycle we have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.230" end="00:28:02.750" style="s2">baby boom demographic we have the wealth</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.880" end="00:28:12.410" style="s2">and the shift in world&#39;s monetary</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.370" end="00:28:14.510" style="s2">systems and the thing about all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.410" end="00:28:16.400" style="s2">cycles is that they have all peaked and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.510" end="00:28:18.710" style="s2">they&#39;re starting to descend which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.400" end="00:28:21.890" style="s2">deflationary deflation deflation</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.710" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">deflation deflation deflation and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.890" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">is all happening at the time when the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.740" end="00:28:29.179" style="s2">world monetary system is developing</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:31.940" style="s2">stress cracks it&#39;s about to implode and</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.799" end="00:28:38.450" style="s2">more chaotic so that&#39;s the convergence</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.530" end="00:28:40.850" style="s2">of cycles and all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.450" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">the reason that I am expecting deflation</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.850" end="00:28:45.919" style="s2">before big inflation or hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:47.660" style="s2">but just as I said in my book any</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:48.590" style="s2">deflation is probably going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.660" end="00:28:51.710" style="s2">short-lived</p>
