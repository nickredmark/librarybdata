<p begin="00:23:29.539" end="00:23:36.690" style="s2">so this very elusive for me there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.860" end="00:23:39.270" style="s2">lot of associations coming up but</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.690" end="00:23:42.750" style="s2">they&#39;re all sort of mingling and merging</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.270" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">about I got that sense that she&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.750" end="00:23:47.280" style="s2">through this image to call me and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:51.210" style="s2">one that&#39;s getting most was the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.280" end="00:23:54.179" style="s2">line of fish not drown in water there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.210" end="00:23:58.470" style="s2">a deep relationship here and what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.179" end="00:24:02.460" style="s2">I&#39;m associating that with is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.470" end="00:24:05.669" style="s2">that&#39;s normally so presuppose so in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.460" end="00:24:10.980" style="s2">background again so foundational it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.669" end="00:24:16.830" style="s2">very it&#39;s almost invisible but to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.980" end="00:24:18.200" style="s2">remember to realize so there&#39;s I she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.830" end="00:24:21.780" style="s2">trying to point out that our</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.200" end="00:24:23.970" style="s2">relationship to being the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.780" end="00:24:24.809" style="s2">being to God is like relationship of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.809" end="00:24:31.620" style="s2">so what does that mean trying to click</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.590" end="00:24:34.110" style="s2">so I&#39;m picking up on that resonating</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.620" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">with what does that mean getting an</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.110" end="00:24:42.600" style="s2">inkling of it it&#39;s not very clear in</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:44.490" style="s2">that sense so try then almost now</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.600" end="00:24:48.750" style="s2">imagine myself as a fish in the water</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.490" end="00:24:50.220" style="s2">we can&#39;t be like what&#39;s up and then then</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.750" end="00:24:52.710" style="s2">I get a sense of this is helic what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.220" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">it like almost invisible</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.710" end="00:24:59.070" style="s2">I see all the beings all the things of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:25:00.600" style="s2">the world I&#39;m not aware of being just</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.070" end="00:25:03.299" style="s2">like the fish is seeing all the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.600" end="00:25:05.070" style="s2">in the water it&#39;s not aware of the water</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.299" end="00:25:09.750" style="s2">and how the water is sustaining it</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.070" end="00:25:13.590" style="s2">giving it life trying to remember that</p>
