<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s everything we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">do right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.760" end="00:02:32.080" style="s2">so a quick review we&#39;re taking a look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">the second major uh pillar of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.080" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">vegetarianism we&#39;ve looked at</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">the disciplining of desire um arthur</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">has actually written a book on all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">hellenistic practices called the therapy</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">of desire</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">um and in there we looked about you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">discipline your desires so you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">and hone in on anorexia the two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">and savoring as a practice to give up to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">put us in touch</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">with peritelic anorexia which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">the touchstone well now</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">we&#39;re going to look at the disciplining</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">fear so desires oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">pleasure fear oriented towards pain</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">they are actually interdefining but this</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">is at least pedagogically useful to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">these distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">i want to remind everybody that i agree</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">wholeheartedly with mclennan</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">uh that epicureanism is not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">but it is powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">it is our primary school stoicism will</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">be our high school</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">and neoplatonism will be our university</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking about a specific kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">of fear here we&#39;re not talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">automatic instinctive fear that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">hardwired there&#39;s nothing we can do</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">about that and therefore there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">we should try to do about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">um what we&#39;re talking about is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">of fear</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">that results from the way in which we um</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">self-terrify and that is the way in</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">which our undisciplined imagination</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">uh terrifies us and then the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">is we want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">create a practice of the reflective</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">discernment</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">and disciplining of imagination so</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re getting into an</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">imaginative state</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">that is generating fear you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">to bring these epicurean practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">to bear and the mainly the main</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">set of practices is captured by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">maxim of the four-fold</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">uh you know don&#39;t fear the gods right</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">don&#39;t fear death</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">don&#39;t fear uh you know the loss of pain</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">and remember that pleasure is easy to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">obtain and there&#39;s various translations</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">of it that&#39;s the basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">okay so we talked about what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">by imagination</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">we mean that we modern cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">is really moving towards is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">that imagination and perception are</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">reception is the bottom-up intake of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">new information and then right their</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">imagination is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">is the top-down aspect which is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">prediction of the patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">going to be found</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">and we can run this top-down prediction</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">uh without any bottom-up corrective</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">um information and that&#39;s imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">and the thing about imagination is of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">course it opens up the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">space of possibilities that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">consider and that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">uh but we want to steer a course between</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">the calvinists who</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">are afraid of that opening up of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">potential for idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">and the romantics who just celebrate it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">and don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">the self-deception and so we want</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">we want a discipline</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">sorry don&#39;t know what that was we</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">want a a disciplined imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">so i don&#39;t quite know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">so jason&#39;s just taking care of it sorry</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">about that it&#39;s not it&#39;s now solved</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">all right so we want a reflectively</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">disciplined imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">and what does that mean for us well what</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">it means is we</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">note that because imagination does not</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">have the bottom-up perception</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">it is especially prey</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">to cognitive bias and to and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">to self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean we should reject</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">it or repress it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">we should discipline it and use it</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">properly in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">rationally reflective manner all right</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">the first one is the gods are not to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">feared for many of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">myself included uh we don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">gods</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">um i&#39;m not not being insulting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">just a statistical statement</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">um for those of us who do believe in</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">some kind of divinity we&#39;ve had two</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.039" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">millennia of christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">islam or judaism teaching us that god is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">basically good</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">and not capricious or malicious but an</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">inherently moral being</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">so the actual revolution and the acts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">religions are taking care of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">that aspect and i think in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">what epicurus was</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">addressing is obsolete but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">way we can expand epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">and make it relevant to us today i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">going a little bit rapidly because this</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">is review i&#39;ll slow down when we get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">the new</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">new material one is the uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">and margaret visser makes an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">case for this in her book beyond fate</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">um you can you can see this as the fear</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">of fate</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">uh the fear of the fact that uh the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">universe unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">according to powers and principles</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">beyond our control beyond our ken</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">um and in ways that are often completely</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">indifferent</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">in a titanic fashion to our narrative</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">projects our personal concerns</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:29.599" style="s2">um our relationships etc so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">uh the idea of fate and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">what is at the core of this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">understanding often implicit that we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">finite infallible creatures</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">and that we are always finite infallible</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">creatures and this is the fatality of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">all things</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">fatality doesn&#39;t just mean subject to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">death it means</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">subject to fate not as some you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:49.680" style="s2">pre-written destiny or something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:52.879" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">but in the sense that we will always</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.879" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">be finite and fallible and we will</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">always be vulnerable to be overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">by forces beyond our understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">control and that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">scary no doubt about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">learning to not avoid our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">but embrace it appropriately is part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">what the epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">are trying to give us i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">going to need help from the stoics and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">the neoplatons down the road</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">uh so what they um</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">what they&#39;re basically trying to get us</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">uh to realize</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">is that um and again the epicurean is</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">more enacted than actually theorize it</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">but although we are finite infallible we</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">are also capable of significant</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:41.080" style="s2">we can self-transcend and philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">the practice the art of such</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.080" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">and so learning to practice philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">will actually help us like i say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">the point i&#39;m going to make now is going</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">to be first explicated and then i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">really develop richly</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">in the neoplatonus that our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">coming into contact with which what with</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">that which that is most real is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">best way to ameliorate</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">uh our our affinity and our fall ability</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">so when we kind of when we come into</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">contact and we can favor</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">what is most real that addresses um the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">concern</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">that is born in us um from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">confrontation with our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">i would put to you that perhaps this at</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">least what some traditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">uh claim and i have found it to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">experientially powerful in my life</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">that i do not long for immortality</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">i long for reality along for being most</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">and once that and the stoics claimed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">the new plaintiff&#39;s plane that once</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve touched that and this seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">central also i would claim buddhism that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">once you touch that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">um your fear up due to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">mortality diminishes significantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">so the other one might be a fear of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">afterlife um</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">and like epicurus i use the best science</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">of our time</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">i find um and i think this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">epicureans would argue i find the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">proposal</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">of an afterlife scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">improbable highly improbable</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">the increasing evidence of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">interdependence between</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">mind brain body and environment and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">clearly know that the body and the brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">perish and are impermanent um</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">that to me means i i&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">concerned with an afterlife but some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">you might have</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">uh sort of remember i don&#39;t use this</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">word insultingly you might have a mythic</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">model of the afterlife the epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">recommend that you actually imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">and and this is where the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:51.279" style="s2">traditions can be very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:53.279" style="s2">the intro traditions ask you to re</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.279" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">actually expand your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.279" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">and confront the horror of immortality</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:10:59.839" style="s2">uh that living forever would is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">basically an attempt to freeze the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.839" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">and to freeze yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">and this is just titanically would empty</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">everything of meaning you face a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:12.720" style="s2">meaningless existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">this is why uh that in vedanta you see</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">muksha which is release</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">from immortality or in buddhism nirvana</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">the blowing out of the flame of personal</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">etc so i think if you open yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">up to both the science and alternative</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">mythologies that have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">expansive imagination</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">that can significantly ameliorate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">fear of the afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">so then we moved into what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">actually confronting when we confront</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">the fear of mortality is the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">and then the epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">point out that well there&#39;s two aspects</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">this one is the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">so here&#39;s the mortality</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">and what you might be fearing here is</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">uh or if you&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">and then they point out again using</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">imagination in a disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">rational fashion um that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">if your fear of death is the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">non-existence that&#39;s absurd</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">uh there has been eons and eons when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">did not exist</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t strike you with terror</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">or it shouldn&#39;t strike you with terror</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">um and you can&#39;t actually experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">your non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">i&#39;ll be curious they said where death is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:37.839" style="s2">i am not</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">where i am death is not so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.839" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">fearing something that you will never</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">experience you will never know so</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:48.639" style="s2">those two you know if you actually play</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">with your imagination in those two ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.639" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">in a rationally disciplined fashion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">like oh right non-existence isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">something that i should fear</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">now but something that i don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">epicureans quite got is some people</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">you know it&#39;s yeah but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">that mysteriousness of fear</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">not it&#39;s theoretical there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">theoretical mystery i know i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">die right</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">all other creatures do all other things</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">are impermanent so not</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">but what we mean by a mystery is it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">experiential what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">phenomenological mystery i cannot</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">imagine being dead i could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">myself in the darkness but</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">i&#39;m there right and so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">inherently mysterious about that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">the fact that we can&#39;t imagine it is we</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">can be very</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">fearful peer producing in us because we</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine something</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">that mystery can be oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">unpredictable it&#39;s uncertain but</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">technically it&#39;s not unpredictable or</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s mysterious and then i would</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">recommend to you that especially in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">what we need to do is to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:51.920" style="s2">transform our the aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">mysterious to go from experiencing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.920" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">as a primarily negative thing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">experiencing it as a primarily positive</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">thing and so a kind of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve all had</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">that points that out is the experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">of ah strangely the experience of ah we</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">know this experimentally in</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">designing experiments with jennifer</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">steller and michelle uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">ferrari and some cameron doing uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">talking to brian ostof on his</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">we know that ah actually diminishes the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">sense of self people feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">like they&#39;re almost overwhelmed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">but yet awe is a very positive</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a very positive experience and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">um and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">if we develop a virtue for</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">awe reverence then we</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">can train ourselves to confront</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">mystery in its positive aspect</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">rather than uh fixating on its negative</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">aspect</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">okay so what about the fear of dying</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">okay and that is something you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">experience and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s kind of unknown um</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">interestingly enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">um when you get when people actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">sit down this is some of the work done</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">on death reflection</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">and they imagine dying and they imagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">their friends with them</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">this is interesting so when they just</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">imagine death in the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">this that it often and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">dispute around this</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">this research but mortality salience</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">they sort of get rigid and afraid</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">but when they go into a first person</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:29.839" style="s2">perspective and actually imagine dying</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">with people around them it actually has</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">the opposite effect it makes them open</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">compassionate that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">epicurean practice of getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">habit</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">of being in philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">companionship with others</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.560" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">being able to carry that all the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">through that actually hooks up with some</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:56.079" style="s2">recent empirical data</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">so again imagine properly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.079" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">more deeply imagine in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">backed</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">by whatever whatever scientific evidence</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look at some more of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">evidence well what you said well what</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid is i&#39;m afraid of losing as i</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">get old i&#39;m going to lose so much</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">now that&#39;s interesting because if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">actually take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">a couple things if you look at uh you</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">know how people&#39;s sense of subjective</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">how much they sort of like their life um</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">it has a weird the breath is weird so</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">this is sort of how much you like your</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">life and this is your age</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">like when you&#39;re in your 30s and your</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">40s probably where you are right now it</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">goes down</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">so right like so here&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">childhood into adolescence but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">what people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">and what they expect reasonably is they</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">expect this</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">that&#39;s what they predict it&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">it&#39;s reasonable that&#39;s what they imagine</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">but what they&#39;re doing shows is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">this as people move into their old age</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">they go up like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">they look like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:05.520" style="s2">hey no these like everything in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.520" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">this is probabilistic of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">individuals that do this</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">right but what we&#39;re saying is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">prediction of the inevitability of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">is definitely disconfirmed empirical</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">evidence doesn&#39;t support this and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">might ask</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">well what is going on here people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">losing all very very many pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">what is it that&#39;s happening here well</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">what&#39;s it seems to be is wisdom now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessary that older people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">wiser</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not an inevitability either but</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">in general they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">and that seems to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">predictive of life satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">and of meaning in life so what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">up here is meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">and that actually makes life very good</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for my eraser</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know where it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">sorry i can&#39;t find it i&#39;m just gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">a paper towel</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">jason&#39;s pointed to me but i can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">it so we&#39;ll just use a paper towel</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">okay so this brings up an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">thing and i&#39;ve mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">and this is the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">your sort of sense of contentment and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">and then there&#39;s some confusions about</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">this so</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">this is your sense of this is the sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">that yourself is sort of satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">and solidified and and it&#39;s doing well</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">right and that&#39;s a subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">now interestingly people right</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">think that power and wealth are the main</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">route to that and our culture teaches</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">this and we mention this</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">with eric trum and what so this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:39.120" style="s2">subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">and then this is this is wealth or power</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.120" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re often conjoined and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">you find</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">is right when people are in poverty</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">their subjective well-being is very low</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">so we have an obligation to get people</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">out of poverty out of scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">overwhelming evidence but what happened</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">initially differences in wealth make a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">huge difference in subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s where where we get this idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">but what happens is then it plateaus and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">goes up very very gradually</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">so that there&#39;s only a very small</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">increase in subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">with massive increases in wealth</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">so once you&#39;re out of poverty the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">pursuit of wealth is an irrational way</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">to pursue subjective well-being okay so</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">and then what you have to ask is well</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">what actually is contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:35.280" style="s2">subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">it has to do more with your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.280" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">and that how much you&#39;re how much you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">in control of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re learning here with</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">epicureanism um</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">your sense of confidence that you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">cultivated skills and virtues</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">that help you to deal with life and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">um which actually will you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">relationships to others</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">but that&#39;s a bit where i can i agree</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">with some people that&#39;s where this</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">construct and this construct to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">confounded</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting is that how</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">meaningful people find their lives</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">is not to be identified with subjective</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">because one can go significantly down</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.799" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">and while the other goes up what are two</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">instances in which</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the case well one clear instance</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">is having a child</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">when you have a child your subjective</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">well-being crashes you&#39;re hungry you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">tired</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a lot of unknowns uh your</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">finances</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">are going to be challenged your most</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">significant relationships are going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">be put up</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">you know under stress et cetera right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">why do people have children they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">trouble because</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">meaning in life goes up</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">when people are getting older aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">this go down because your health</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">declines</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">your social relationships strength</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">meaning in life goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">up in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">meaning in life is how you are connected</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">connected to others and connected to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">what&#39;s most real</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">so the cultivation of wisdom which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">about removing self-deceptive patterns</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">that destroy your relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">to other people and to the world is how</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">you enhance</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:45.360" style="s2">so and how do we cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">wisdom in a way that&#39;s going to enhance</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.360" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">by phyllis what the what the epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">say is by philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">companionship</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">by cultivating philosophic shared</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">the shared philosophy of the shared</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">with others philia means communal</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">brotherly like sexist but the communal</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">by leah sophia of wisdom the communal</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">love of wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">you say well really yeah it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">what you have to understand is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">not actually very good at predicting</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">your subjective</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">even your subjective wellbeing there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">thing called the hedonic treadmill</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">so you can study what happens to people</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">after they&#39;ve confronted a significant</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">now again</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">probabilistically there are always</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">individual cases</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">right but probabilistically you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">study what happens to people who win the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">lottery</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">or who suffer a major accident trauma</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">and what you find it when it initially</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">happens there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">change in their subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">life is great</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">or life is hell heaven or hell but</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">within about eight</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">weeks they return back to the state they</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">were in</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">before the lottery and you say it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">be for me that won&#39;t happen for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">oh yeah it will i can make that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">prediction with a lot of confidence</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">or after trauma they return back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">where they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">so your your hedonic set point is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">you know it&#39;s really really robust and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">that means environmental changes don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">impact it as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">where you can make a significant</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">difference</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">i changed a lot and our self-knowledge</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">you can zero in on the fact that you</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">argument here but one shot of that right</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">is the fact that meaning in life is much</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">for us right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">and uh taekwon soho has a question here</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.319" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">i have been contemplating static</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">pleasure and realize i</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">only noticed active players could you</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">elaborate on mindfulness as an aide to</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">static pleasure um so</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what i was intending to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">the um the the savoring experiences</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">um there is a place you can get to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">i understand in one sense the savoring</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing the walking and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">transforming the world into a garden</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s an active it&#39;s you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">but you come to him at least what</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">is the mindfulness gets you to a place</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">where the joy</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">is not in any of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">textures or tones it&#39;s not right in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">the musicality of your intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">um the joy drops to and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">intent the joy drops to</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">sorry i should be turning and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">you guys the joy adopts to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">um the pleasure the pure pleasure of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">and a way to think about that that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">like in</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">regular vipassana we&#39;re following the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.359" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">flow of our breath and we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.640" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">state that&#39;s very active but when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">when we pursue deep vipassana and drop</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">into the mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">right uh that that mindfulness of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">space between our thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">the pure being of our mind in a similar</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">you&#39;re doing sort of like regular</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">something analogous to regular vipassana</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">when you&#39;re first</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">doing the savoring but then you can draw</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">to that silence underneath all the music</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">the the living silence the energetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">matrix of silence</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">that make amusing metaphors that makes</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:02.079" style="s2">all the musicality</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">of intelligibility so beneath the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.079" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">flowing pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">of the musicality of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">as you&#39;re walking and you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">experiencing the pure</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">pleasure of presencing you can draw on</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">right this moves a little bit beyond</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">epicureanism but with</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">mindfulness you can then think ah but i</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">can can i sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">that silence from which</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">the presence thing emerges and can i</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">come to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">a kind of profound rest and peace</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">in that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">so the degree to which you can find</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">in the principle that regulates</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">presenting that generates it regulates</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">is a degree to which you can use a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">profound kind of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:54.720" style="s2">you can use deep vipassana a deep kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.720" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">to access that profoundest kind of</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">i hope that&#39;s helpful we&#39;ll take one</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">more question</p>
