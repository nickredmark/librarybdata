<p begin="00:00:08.580" end="00:00:12.660" style="s2">wanting to give you just a brief</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.110" end="00:00:15.299" style="s2">introduction to what I mean by culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:17.940" style="s2">design and the need for creating a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.299" end="00:00:20.609" style="s2">globally focused research foundation to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.940" end="00:00:22.890" style="s2">guide the formation of a science of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.609" end="00:00:24.570" style="s2">intentional social change so in in</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">really simple terms think of it this way</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">that there is a convergence of crises in</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">the world there are many things</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">happening to our communities at all</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">scales as we&#39;re going through a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">of disruptions in the world and at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:42.210" style="s2">same time there&#39;s this massive body of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:44.010" style="s2">knowledge skills solutions and insights</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.210" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">that are out there in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.010" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">they&#39;re not properly combined and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">communicated in a way that people can</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">take them and apply them to the process</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:57.180" style="s2">of social change so right now there is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">desperate need for humanity to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">collectively get its act together to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">deal with the planetary crisis of global</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:08.540" style="s2">warming wealth inequality political</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.540" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">etc the planetary scale the more local</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">scale we have things like you know high</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">school dropout rates math of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">and suicide depression people that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">going on pathways to radicalization and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">extremism due to a variety of social</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">factors and what&#39;s interesting is when</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">we step back and ask what is known about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">each of these problems we start to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">discover that in the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:40.250" style="s2">behavioral sciences in prevention</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">science and public health research in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.250" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">evolutionary studies in various places</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:49.549" style="s2">the solutions already exist but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">not being brought together and applied</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.549" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">similarly when we look at the social</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">change practices we see if there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">scenario planning there are different</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">management tools that exist different</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">ways of facilitating groups to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:03.890" style="s2">desired goals and there we see that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">there all of these tried-and-true</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.890" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">programs techniques</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:10.530" style="s2">models solutions but they&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:14.850" style="s2">brought together in a strategic manner</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.530" end="00:02:16.860" style="s2">to guide the process of social change so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.850" end="00:02:19.470" style="s2">what I&#39;m proposing to do is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.860" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">research foundation that does three</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.470" end="00:02:24.990" style="s2">things the first thing that it&#39;ll do is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">it will coordinate integrative research</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.990" end="00:02:31.620" style="s2">agendas for design research and action</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2">research for applied solutions and these</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.620" end="00:02:36.209" style="s2">will bring together the research</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:38.459" style="s2">community to synthesize knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.209" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">apply it to social change with</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.459" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">practitioners in the communities working</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">on social change and also set up</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.920" style="s2">cultural monitoring and tracking</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:49.020" style="s2">processes for those social change</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:51.030" style="s2">practitioners to have researchers</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.020" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">studying the culture as it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.030" end="00:02:54.270" style="s2">and getting feedback to help them</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">understand what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.270" end="00:02:59.640" style="s2">and the second thing that this research</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2">foundation will do is it will set up a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.640" end="00:03:04.890" style="s2">massive open access database so anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">doing social change work will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.890" end="00:03:08.550" style="s2">have the monitoring and analysis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">done the data that&#39;s gathered be put</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.550" end="00:03:13.580" style="s2">into a common database so that best</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:16.470" style="s2">practices can be created from looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.580" end="00:03:18.570" style="s2">across a wide diversity of projects that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.470" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">will grow and populate the ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.570" end="00:03:23.940" style="s2">this community over time now the third</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">thing that this project will do is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">will create a series of culture design</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.810" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">labs which is a small number of focused</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">projects that will become case studies</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">for the design science of intentional</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:41.600" style="s2">social change over the next three years</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:43.980" style="s2">and then these case studies will become</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.600" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">demonstrative of what is possible when</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.980" end="00:03:47.730" style="s2">we take an integrative approach to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:50.160" style="s2">creating a design science for social</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.730" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">change now why is this so essential now</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.160" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">I think that the answer that is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">obvious but I&#39;ll step out and give a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">big-picture point of view for how I see</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">this change happening so first of all we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.959" end="00:04:01.440" style="s2">have this convergence of crises in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:03.810" style="s2">world that threaten the viability of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.440" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">civilization we literally could collapse</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">or planetary civilization in the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:09.600" style="s2">few decades so now let&#39;s kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">forward in time and say what would</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.600" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">happen what needs to happen in the year</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">2050 for us to avoid systemic collapse</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:18.659" style="s2">well basically in 2050 we would need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:21.400" style="s2">have and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.659" end="00:04:22.629" style="s2">all infrastructure in the built</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.400" end="00:04:25.960" style="s2">environment and all of our social</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.629" end="00:04:28.439" style="s2">practices built about around biomimicry</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.960" end="00:04:31.180" style="s2">principles and regenerative design</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.439" end="00:04:32.830" style="s2">basically we have to undo all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.180" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">damage we do between now and then and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.830" end="00:04:36.430" style="s2">then be sure that we&#39;re operating in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:38.680" style="s2">harmony with nature from then forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.430" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">but to have all of that happening by</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.680" end="00:04:43.419" style="s2">2050 let&#39;s use a signature number here</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:46.090" style="s2">which is that many of our large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.419" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">infrastructure projects take 20 years to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.090" end="00:04:51.039" style="s2">build so that means that for us to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">gotten to 100% biomimicry in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.039" end="00:04:56.379" style="s2">regenerative design in 2050 by 2030 we</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:04:58.330" style="s2">have to be sure that everyone graduating</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.379" end="00:05:00.819" style="s2">from universities with advanced degrees</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.330" end="00:05:03.460" style="s2">and professional master&#39;s programs and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.819" end="00:05:05.620" style="s2">PhDs or being trained in regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.460" end="00:05:07.780" style="s2">design and biomimicry in whatever field</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.620" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">that they&#39;re in well for us to have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.780" end="00:05:13.060" style="s2">happen in universities by 2030 that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:15.810" style="s2">means that by around 2020 we have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.060" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">establish a core set of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:21.639" style="s2">demonstration sites that become case</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:24.190" style="s2">studies for best practices to emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.639" end="00:05:25.690" style="s2">to propagate across our universities and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.190" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">professional domains throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.690" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">2020s so what that tells us is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:34.509" style="s2">between now in the middle of 2016 and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">around 2020 we need to create this</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.509" end="00:05:38.979" style="s2">series of case studies and demonstration</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:40.930" style="s2">projects so that they can propagate</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.979" end="00:05:44.469" style="s2">across our educational systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.930" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">throughout the next couple of decades so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.469" end="00:05:50.440" style="s2">that by the middle of the century we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:52.360" style="s2">guiding and increasingly shaping or</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.440" end="00:05:54.580" style="s2">planetary civilization in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.360" end="00:05:56.409" style="s2">aren&#39;t harmony with the planet and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.580" end="00:05:59.139" style="s2">is something that might seem grandiose</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.409" end="00:06:01.419" style="s2">in ambitious and unrealistic but I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.139" end="00:06:03.159" style="s2">argue exactly the opposite that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.419" end="00:06:04.719" style="s2">are mountains and mountains of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.159" end="00:06:06.789" style="s2">scientific knowledge and literally</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.719" end="00:06:09.490" style="s2">hundreds of fields showing us that only</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.789" end="00:06:10.930" style="s2">this scale of an effort is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.490" end="00:06:13.539" style="s2">sufficient to deal with the scale of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.930" end="00:06:15.310" style="s2">problems that we have to tackle as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.539" end="00:06:17.710" style="s2">seven point four billion of us alive on</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.310" end="00:06:19.509" style="s2">the planet today so the small part that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.710" end="00:06:22.779" style="s2">I&#39;m wanting to do and then I&#39;m applying</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.779" end="00:06:27.610" style="s2">demonstrate that a design science of</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:43.970" style="s2">is really doable and if we were to ask</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.970" end="00:06:49.010" style="s2">of the world scientists live today and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.630" end="00:06:52.700" style="s2">someone has done this actually as you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.010" end="00:06:55.040" style="s2">can google it 90% of all scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.700" end="00:06:56.990" style="s2">have ever lived or alive</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.040" end="00:07:00.140" style="s2">right now and this is the cumulative</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">first 300 years of science so the scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.300" end="00:07:16.730" style="s2">of knowledge that is available to us is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">immense and huge in deeply inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.730" end="00:07:23.150" style="s2">what we&#39;re lacking is the active</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:25.040" style="s2">curation in synthesis in application of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.150" end="00:07:27.590" style="s2">all of this knowledge to tackle our</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.040" end="00:07:29.390" style="s2">problems in real time and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.590" end="00:07:30.770" style="s2">setting out to do is create a</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.540" end="00:07:40.490" style="s2">humanity so I would love for us to go on</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.300" end="00:07:45.490" style="s2">this journey together let&#39;s join forces</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.490" end="00:07:45.490" style="s2">and let&#39;s change the world thank you</p>
