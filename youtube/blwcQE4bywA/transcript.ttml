<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:08.130" style="s2">so our next speaker is Donald Robinson</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.000" end="00:00:10.940" style="s2">Donald is cbt trained psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">and he&#39;s the author of six books on</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.940" end="00:00:17.310" style="s2">stoicism and I mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">Donald is really the the super glue of</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.310" end="00:00:23.010" style="s2">the whole stoic community I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:25.470" style="s2">we&#39;d be here today if it wasn&#39;t for him</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.010" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">and and the efforts and initiatives that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.470" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">he took to organize the stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:32.130" style="s2">internationally and he released the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:35.190" style="s2">recently released a book called how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.130" end="00:00:37.140" style="s2">think like a Roman Emperor and today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:39.480" style="s2">talk is how to practice like an old</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.140" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">Roman Emperor and so we&#39;re going to is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.480" end="00:00:43.410" style="s2">going to examine Marcus releases</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.190" end="00:00:45.629" style="s2">meditation and what kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.410" end="00:00:47.160" style="s2">life practices can be gleaned from it so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.629" end="00:00:53.780" style="s2">let&#39;s give a warm welcome to Donald</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:53.780" style="s2">Robinson thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.100" end="00:01:01.219" style="s2">okay hi everyone so I did quite a formal</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.359" end="00:01:02.989" style="s2">exercise with you and you&#39;ve done a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.219" end="00:01:05.710" style="s2">of meditation today which is really cool</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.989" end="00:01:08.330" style="s2">so you&#39;ll already be pretty mellow and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.710" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">contemplative earlier we had some</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.330" end="00:01:12.229" style="s2">discussion our theory before we did the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:14.210" style="s2">view from above and now we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.229" end="00:01:16.490" style="s2">do some kind of discussion of strategies</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.210" end="00:01:18.229" style="s2">and concepts after having done a an</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.490" end="00:01:21.590" style="s2">exercise that&#39;s going to be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.229" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">as well and I&#39;m going to go through a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.590" end="00:01:26.990" style="s2">whole bunch of psychological exercises</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:28.789" style="s2">that I found in ancient stores Azzam so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.990" end="00:01:30.350" style="s2">my background is in cognitive behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.789" end="00:01:32.630" style="s2">therapy and the niche that I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.350" end="00:01:34.970" style="s2">ended up finding my cell phone is</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.630" end="00:01:37.220" style="s2">talking about the the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.970" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">practices that are found in store sysm</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.220" end="00:01:40.640" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to go through a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">of them and give you some hints and tips</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:44.750" style="s2">about how to actually put them in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:46.280" style="s2">practice and because these are</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.750" end="00:01:47.690" style="s2">techniques I&#39;ve been using in workshops</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.280" end="00:01:51.619" style="s2">and with clients and therapy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.690" end="00:01:53.450" style="s2">coaching for about 20 years know why</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.619" end="00:01:56.360" style="s2">that was how this whole thing got</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.450" end="00:01:58.340" style="s2">started I was saying earlier you you saw</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.360" end="00:02:02.180" style="s2">a picture of the first workshop that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.340" end="00:02:03.380" style="s2">did the Exeter University and I was in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.180" end="00:02:04.969" style="s2">that group I don&#39;t know if you spotted</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.380" end="00:02:07.070" style="s2">me in the photograph my hair was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.969" end="00:02:10.100" style="s2">little bit dark : there&#39;s a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.070" end="00:02:12.620" style="s2">less wrinkled and that whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.100" end="00:02:14.870" style="s2">started because of an audio recording of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.620" end="00:02:16.940" style="s2">the view from above the same exercise</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.870" end="00:02:18.590" style="s2">that you guys did earlier and that went</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.940" end="00:02:20.150" style="s2">online and some students at Exeter</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.590" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">listened to it and they thought we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.150" end="00:02:23.269" style="s2">should do this thing called stoic weak</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">and that was how this whole thing got</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.269" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">started basically but I&#39;m going to throw</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:30.109" style="s2">in some stories as well and anecdotes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:32.450" style="s2">make that sizes a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.109" end="00:02:36.820" style="s2">interesting so we&#39;ll see how that goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:39.650" style="s2">and the story I wanted to start with is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.820" end="00:02:42.859" style="s2">about Socrates actually because I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.650" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">believe the I read the Stoics as being</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.859" end="00:02:47.780" style="s2">Socratic s-- I can I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:50.120" style="s2">important it&#39;s very valuable to look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.780" end="00:02:51.890" style="s2">the Socratic dialogues or Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:54.350" style="s2">perhaps see more so the ones from</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.890" end="00:02:57.170" style="s2">Xenophon in order to put the Stuart</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.350" end="00:02:58.489" style="s2">ratings and exercises in context and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.170" end="00:02:59.900" style="s2">lot of the things that we found in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.489" end="00:03:03.410" style="s2">Stoics can be found</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.900" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">teased earlier in Socrates often with</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.410" end="00:03:09.370" style="s2">more supporting arguments</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">and Plato&#39;s Republic I think him book</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.370" end="00:03:15.250" style="s2">four and then this is returned to again</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">at book ten I&#39;m speaking from memory so</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.250" end="00:03:19.870" style="s2">I if I remember rightly some of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">references should be as I described but</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.870" end="00:03:25.390" style="s2">you guys can fact check them later</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:29.790" style="s2">Socrates is talking to glow cone Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.390" end="00:03:31.780" style="s2">brother about the Greek tragedies and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.790" end="00:03:33.069" style="s2">glowkies said Socrates what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.780" end="00:03:34.930" style="s2">of the tragedies are really cool aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.069" end="00:03:37.569" style="s2">they you know wait when Oedipus goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.930" end="00:03:39.639" style="s2">crazy why because he finds that he slept</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.569" end="00:03:41.560" style="s2">with his mother and Medea goes crazy</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.639" end="00:03:43.269" style="s2">because she finds her husband Jason</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.560" end="00:03:44.980" style="s2">sudden affair and she kills her children</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.269" end="00:03:47.109" style="s2">and stuff it&#39;s like we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.980" end="00:03:50.109" style="s2">awesome tragedies and this is a high</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.109" end="00:03:54.750" style="s2">point of Greek culture and Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.109" end="00:03:57.010" style="s2">surprisingly shockingly says well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.750" end="00:04:00.189" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think these people have</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.010" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">really good role models in fact their</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.189" end="00:04:05.139" style="s2">case studies in psychopathology why</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:08.650" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what they would be good for</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.139" end="00:04:10.120" style="s2">and then in and he says the wise man</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.650" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t respond in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.120" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">adversity in this way and then in book</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:17.530" style="s2">ten he returns celebrate honor and go</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:20.709" style="s2">out Khan says well hello then Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.530" end="00:04:21.579" style="s2">would a wise man respond in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.709" end="00:04:24.039" style="s2">adversity</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.579" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">and Socrates says well he would do four</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.039" end="00:04:32.590" style="s2">things first of all he would tell</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:34.449" style="s2">himself the the it&#39;s never clear when</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.590" end="00:04:37.720" style="s2">something happens whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.449" end="00:04:39.340" style="s2">ultimately good or bad and there are two</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.720" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">reasons for that like in the tragedies</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.340" end="00:04:45.580" style="s2">there are many reversals of fortune in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:46.810" style="s2">life somebody may lose their job maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.580" end="00:04:49.539" style="s2">the best thing that ever happens to them</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.810" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">our relationship may break up seems like</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.539" end="00:04:53.139" style="s2">a terrible catastrophe at the time maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">it&#39;s for the best in the long run yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.139" end="00:04:57.070" style="s2">so things that seem like a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:04:59.380" style="s2">is may in the long run turn out to be in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.070" end="00:05:02.830" style="s2">our best interests and the other reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.380" end="00:05:04.330" style="s2">is the someone might lose their job like</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.830" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">one person make court badly whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.330" end="00:05:08.409" style="s2">another person may clown from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">experience so it depends on the use that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.409" end="00:05:13.000" style="s2">we make of these experiences so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:15.279" style="s2">clear whether something&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.000" end="00:05:17.080" style="s2">to be good for us or bad for us so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.279" end="00:05:19.180" style="s2">should kind of suspend judgment and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.080" end="00:05:20.620" style="s2">be unduly alarmed</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.180" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">we encounter what seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.620" end="00:05:23.979" style="s2">misfortune and Glenn says that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">interesting Socrates well the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.979" end="00:05:28.090" style="s2">things that wise man does in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">adversity as Socrates says well the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.090" end="00:05:32.020" style="s2">other thing is a cell it tells himself</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">it&#39;s unnecessary to add another layer of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.020" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">suffering to something that may already</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:40.060" style="s2">be painful and unpleasant why would you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:42.430" style="s2">make yourself even more upset why would</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.060" end="00:05:44.050" style="s2">you make yourself suffer even more when</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.430" end="00:05:46.419" style="s2">the situation that you&#39;re already facing</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.050" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">is painful difficult and unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.419" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">quiet keep another layer of suffering on</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:54.430" style="s2">top of what&#39;s already happening make a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:55.870" style="s2">bad situation worse and Lacan says well</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.430" end="00:05:58.840" style="s2">what was the thought thing Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.870" end="00:06:01.090" style="s2">Socrates said well the wise man tells</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.840" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">himself that nothing is that important</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.090" end="00:06:06.250" style="s2">and the grand scheme of things so for</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">either piece like finding out that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.250" end="00:06:09.610" style="s2">slept with his mother is like the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:13.270" style="s2">awful thing that he can conceivably</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.610" end="00:06:15.190" style="s2">imagine Medea finding out that Jason&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.270" end="00:06:16.840" style="s2">betrayed her is as terrible like the</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.210" end="00:06:24.490" style="s2">of these things are actually that bad</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.259" end="00:06:57.759" style="s2">and Socrates says well the fourth things</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.630" end="00:07:00.130" style="s2">are most important of all Glaucon he</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.759" end="00:07:02.289" style="s2">said the wise man tells himself that if</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.130" end="00:07:03.909" style="s2">he&#39;s like either purse or Medea and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.289" end="00:07:06.009" style="s2">gets really angry and really worked up</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.909" end="00:07:08.470" style="s2">like he experiences and indulges and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.009" end="00:07:11.940" style="s2">they&#39;re rational passions then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.470" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">doing precisely the thing that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.940" end="00:07:18.220" style="s2">unhelpful in the face of a crisis he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.220" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">actually required in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.870" end="00:07:24.610" style="s2">adversity which is thinking clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:27.009" style="s2">rationally and solving the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.610" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">he faces because when we indulge in</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.009" end="00:07:31.810" style="s2">irrational emotions as the stoic said</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.889" style="s2">it&#39;s a form of temporary madness and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.810" end="00:07:34.330" style="s2">prevents us from being able</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.330" end="00:07:40.090" style="s2">we&#39;re facing and solve it rationally so</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.780" end="00:07:42.550" style="s2">those are four strategies that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.090" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">mentions more concisely than not he</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.550" end="00:07:46.659" style="s2">mentions a number very often can a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">fleeting way in Plato&#39;s Republic and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.659" end="00:07:50.830" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty stoic right why we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:53.710" style="s2">see echoes of those sort of ideas in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.830" end="00:07:55.539" style="s2">in the stoic literature as well but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.710" end="00:07:57.159" style="s2">don&#39;t know would we call those exercises</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.539" end="00:07:59.949" style="s2">or not one when we talk about techniques</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.159" end="00:08:01.479" style="s2">or practices in therapy people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.949" end="00:08:04.539" style="s2">different ideas about what would</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.479" end="00:08:06.460" style="s2">constitute a psychological exercise so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.539" end="00:08:09.009" style="s2">would call those cognitive strategies</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.460" end="00:08:11.319" style="s2">those are perspectives or ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.009" end="00:08:13.750" style="s2">interpreting the situation maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.319" end="00:08:15.129" style="s2">sentences or coping statements that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.750" end="00:08:17.439" style="s2">someone might use in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.129" end="00:08:17.800" style="s2">specific situations so as a therapist my</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.439" end="00:08:19.240" style="s2">trainer</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.800" end="00:08:21.639" style="s2">I would conceive of those as</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.240" end="00:08:22.840" style="s2">psychological exercises and there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.639" end="00:08:25.539" style="s2">also other types of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.840" end="00:08:27.909" style="s2">exercises that we find in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.539" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">therapy and in stoicism that may involve</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.909" end="00:08:33.959" style="s2">particular lines of questioning that may</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:36.760" style="s2">involve visualizing situations or</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.959" end="00:08:38.169" style="s2">adopting certain alternate perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.760" end="00:08:43.149" style="s2">on a situation such as the view from</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.169" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">above that we looked at earlier and when</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.149" end="00:08:48.370" style="s2">I roll my first book on stoicism which</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.690" end="00:08:50.949" style="s2">has just come out in a second edition it</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.370" end="00:08:52.269" style="s2">was originally published in 2010 and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.949" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">it&#39;s called the philosophy of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.269" end="00:08:56.910" style="s2">behavioral therapy it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:08:58.899" style="s2">intended for a dual audience of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.910" end="00:09:00.940" style="s2">philosophers and professional</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.899" end="00:09:03.730" style="s2">psychotherapist it wasn&#39;t meant to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.940" end="00:09:05.290" style="s2">kind of self-help guide although a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.730" end="00:09:07.930" style="s2">of people have read it for that reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.290" end="00:09:09.640" style="s2">and what I was trying to do is to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.930" end="00:09:11.910" style="s2">sense in my own mind of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.640" end="00:09:14.110" style="s2">between stoicism and psychotherapy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.910" end="00:09:16.029" style="s2">part of what I did in the book was to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.110" end="00:09:18.579" style="s2">try to list all of the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.029" end="00:09:20.050" style="s2">strategies that I could find described</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.579" end="00:09:22.300" style="s2">in the stoic literature so I did a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.050" end="00:09:24.100" style="s2">survey of all the relevant literature I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.300" end="00:09:26.079" style="s2">could find and all the commentaries that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.100" end="00:09:27.970" style="s2">I could find and I tried to list and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.079" end="00:09:30.100" style="s2">itemized the main psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.970" end="00:09:31.420" style="s2">practices that I could find and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.100" end="00:09:34.570" style="s2">different ways that you could carve</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.420" end="00:09:36.519" style="s2">those techniques up so some of them can</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.570" end="00:09:38.170" style="s2">be lumped together more in groups or</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.519" end="00:09:40.360" style="s2">some of them can be broken down into</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.170" end="00:09:42.310" style="s2">different forms and we could divide them</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:44.319" style="s2">into general psychological strategies</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.310" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">which may take the form of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.319" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">specific types of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:51.700" style="s2">Niek so give you some examples of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:53.380" style="s2">as we&#39;re talking but overall the last I</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.700" end="00:09:55.000" style="s2">drew of distinct psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.380" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">strategies in that book I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.000" end="00:09:59.380" style="s2">numbered them I went back recently</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:10:01.420" style="s2">encountered them they were 18 right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.380" end="00:10:03.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch and armament on</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.420" end="00:10:05.380" style="s2">armamentarium is a term that used to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.940" end="00:10:07.450" style="s2">used in psychotherapy and made this in</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.380" end="00:10:11.080" style="s2">the toolbox we might say of stoic</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.450" end="00:10:12.340" style="s2">techniques it&#39;s quite broad and so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.080" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">may ask well are some of them more</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.340" end="00:10:16.960" style="s2">important than others and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:19.330" style="s2">are why there are some that cannot stand</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.960" end="00:10:21.010" style="s2">though or that list to explore emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.330" end="00:10:23.860" style="s2">on all that seem like they would be more</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.010" end="00:10:25.420" style="s2">foundational basis not clear-cut answer</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.860" end="00:10:27.700" style="s2">to that question because often they seem</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.420" end="00:10:29.770" style="s2">to intersect and overlap with each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.700" end="00:10:31.210" style="s2">so I&#39;m keeping an open mind about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.770" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">you know and I&#39;d be interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.210" end="00:10:35.320" style="s2">your thoughts about that are where some</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:37.570" style="s2">of them do seem to be more important</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.320" end="00:10:40.180" style="s2">than others in Marcus Aurelius for</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.570" end="00:10:43.660" style="s2">example at one point in the meditations</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.180" end="00:10:45.370" style="s2">tries to provide a summary of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.660" end="00:10:46.870" style="s2">doing in that book so there are several</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.370" end="00:10:49.300" style="s2">places where he summarizes the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.870" end="00:10:51.700" style="s2">strategies he&#39;s using and meditations</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.300" end="00:10:54.130" style="s2">1118 he talks about techniques for anger</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.700" end="00:10:55.720" style="s2">management and he lists 10 distinct</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.130" end="00:10:57.820" style="s2">psychological strategies they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.720" end="00:10:58.510" style="s2">positive strategies for coping with</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.820" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">anger</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.510" end="00:11:02.830" style="s2">I think that&#39;s impressive if I asked an</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:05.430" style="s2">audience of cognitive therapists to off</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.830" end="00:11:07.810" style="s2">the top of their head less ten distinct</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.430" end="00:11:09.460" style="s2">psychological strategies for coping with</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.810" end="00:11:12.700" style="s2">anger I think they&#39;ve come up with five</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.460" end="00:11:14.470" style="s2">or six maybe by he can last ten and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.700" end="00:11:16.270" style="s2">can tell he knows them very thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.470" end="00:11:18.339" style="s2">and deeply he keeps returning to them</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.270" end="00:11:20.890" style="s2">throughout the meditations but in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.339" end="00:11:23.650" style="s2">another passage he says look basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.890" end="00:11:27.640" style="s2">all of the Spoils down to two basic</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.650" end="00:11:29.800" style="s2">ideas and he sums them up concisely in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.640" end="00:11:32.770" style="s2">short phrase in Greek it&#39;s only six</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.800" end="00:11:34.660" style="s2">words it&#39;s very brief laconic so stoic</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.770" end="00:11:36.520" style="s2">slight to compress things so that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.660" end="00:11:38.200" style="s2">can be easily memorized and they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.520" end="00:11:40.690" style="s2">ready to hand in the face of adversity</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.200" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">like a coping statement or Maxima or an</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.690" end="00:11:45.730" style="s2">affirmation and therapy today</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:48.820" style="s2">he says the universe is change life is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.730" end="00:11:50.890" style="s2">opinion and luckily we know who he meant</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.820" end="00:11:52.210" style="s2">by that because in the preceding passage</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.890" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2">he can have a library it&#39;s honor a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.210" end="00:11:57.970" style="s2">little birth and it&#39;s a beautiful little</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:11:59.889" style="s2">concise expression of the store so some</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.970" end="00:12:03.100" style="s2">of the meditations anyway but</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.889" end="00:12:06.790" style="s2">he happens to be clearly referring to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.100" end="00:12:08.529" style="s2">two philosophers and the the two</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.790" end="00:12:12.279" style="s2">philosophers he say it&#39;s most frequently</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.529" end="00:12:16.329" style="s2">throughout that lat Burke the universe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.279" end="00:12:19.119" style="s2">changes the reference to Heraclitus like</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.060" end="00:14:33.709" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of being eluded to him</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.250" end="00:14:35.480" style="s2">directly and not short phrase and life</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.709" end="00:14:38.390" style="s2">is opinion means that the quality of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.480" end="00:14:39.620" style="s2">life is shaped by our judgments</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.390" end="00:14:42.230" style="s2">particularly our value judgments</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.620" end="00:14:43.730" style="s2">according to the Stoics and I&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.230" end="00:14:47.089" style="s2">back to that because it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.730" end="00:14:48.440" style="s2">most important concepts and stoicism so</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.089" end="00:14:51.050" style="s2">here are some of the practices that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.440" end="00:14:53.089" style="s2">like to go through cognitive behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.050" end="00:14:55.430" style="s2">therapy I&#39;ll speak more to that in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.089" end="00:14:56.839" style="s2">moment as influenced by Stewarts ism but</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.430" end="00:14:59.750" style="s2">not a lot of people know this that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.839" end="00:15:01.610" style="s2">actually an earlier attempt to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.750" end="00:15:03.230" style="s2">stoicism and Western psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.610" end="00:15:04.970" style="s2">nothing to do with Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.230" end="00:15:07.370" style="s2">psychodynamic or psychoanalytic therapy</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.970" end="00:15:10.130" style="s2">at the beginning of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.370" end="00:15:12.490" style="s2">there was a rival to Freud about a guy</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.130" end="00:15:17.200" style="s2">called Paul Dubois who was a Swiss</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.490" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">psychotherapist and a neurologist and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.200" end="00:15:22.100" style="s2">Jabbar really liked Seneca and tried to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.110" style="s2">assimilate Senecas flaw he would</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.100" end="00:15:26.209" style="s2">prescribe reading letters of Seneca to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.110" end="00:15:27.620" style="s2">his patients and he developed a form of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.209" end="00:15:29.480" style="s2">psychotherapy called rational</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.620" end="00:15:31.070" style="s2">psychotherapy or persuasion</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.480" end="00:15:33.589" style="s2">psychotherapy is that sometimes known</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.070" end="00:15:35.300" style="s2">that was first time competed with</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.589" end="00:15:37.459" style="s2">Freudian psychoanalysis and was</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.300" end="00:15:40.220" style="s2">influenced by stoicism but the better</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.459" end="00:15:42.589" style="s2">stoicism that Dubois and his colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.220" end="00:15:44.209" style="s2">emphasized is slightly different from</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.589" end="00:15:46.550" style="s2">the bet that came to be emphasized later</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.209" end="00:15:50.510" style="s2">what they emphasized was the bet that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.550" end="00:15:53.570" style="s2">call today the dichotomy of control so</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.510" end="00:15:55.730" style="s2">the dichotomy of control is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.570" end="00:15:58.459" style="s2">distinction between what&#39;s up toss and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.730" end="00:16:00.620" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t and I like to frame as</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.459" end="00:16:03.860" style="s2">being a distinction between what we do</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.620" end="00:16:05.390" style="s2">and what merely happens to us and life</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.860" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the distinction between reports</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.390" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">under our voluntary control and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:13.399" style="s2">or as Epictetus Spitzer what&#39;s up to us</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">and our world are our own actions our</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.399" end="00:16:17.480" style="s2">voluntary actions and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:19.390" style="s2">distinguished in stoicism are demarcated</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.480" end="00:16:21.709" style="s2">from everything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.390" end="00:16:23.079" style="s2">it&#39;s famously encapsulated in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.709" end="00:16:25.370" style="s2">serenity prayer</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.079" end="00:16:26.420" style="s2">give me the serenity to accept the</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.420" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">the courage to change the things I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.070" end="00:16:34.070" style="s2">and the wisdom to know the difference so</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">this is a kind of obvious psychological</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.070" end="00:16:39.079" style="s2">strategy and it was integral to early</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.050" end="00:16:41.300" style="s2">20th century rational psychotherapy but</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.079" end="00:16:43.190" style="s2">not so much emphasized and modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.300" end="00:16:44.870" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy although</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.190" end="00:16:46.790" style="s2">there are some things that can of</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.790" end="00:16:50.750" style="s2">couple of quick examples that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.130" end="00:16:53.240" style="s2">thing that we do often in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.750" end="00:16:56.660" style="s2">therapy where somebody excessively</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.240" end="00:16:59.000" style="s2">blames themselves for a situation and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.660" end="00:17:03.560" style="s2">used to work with road traffic accident</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.000" end="00:17:05.179" style="s2">RTA victims and they often were</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.560" end="00:17:07.040" style="s2">traumatized and blamed themselves for</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.179" end="00:17:09.650" style="s2">accidents that they&#39;ve been on and so of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.040" end="00:17:12.110" style="s2">very often I would ask them to draw</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.650" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">maybe a pie chart and to split up in</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.110" end="00:17:17.419" style="s2">segments what factors were to blame for</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">the accident or I&#39;d ask them from zero</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.419" end="00:17:22.459" style="s2">to 100% how much control did you have so</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:24.230" style="s2">I begin by saying look from zero to</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.459" end="00:17:26.360" style="s2">percent how much do you feel as if</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.230" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">you&#39;re to blame for what happened and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.360" end="00:17:29.419" style="s2">they&#39;d usually say a hundred percent or</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:31.850" style="s2">ninety five percent or something like</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.419" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">that and then I&#39;d say let&#39;s ever think</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.850" end="00:17:34.340" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:35.690" style="s2">way you know rationally speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.340" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">zero to hundred percent how much control</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.690" end="00:17:39.350" style="s2">did you actually have over the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.580" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">and they might say five percent are</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.350" end="00:17:47.000" style="s2">often zero percent certain I&#39;d say voila</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.830" end="00:17:49.040" style="s2">why how is it possible why that you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.000" end="00:17:51.770" style="s2">be a hundred percent to blame but zero</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.040" end="00:17:53.270" style="s2">percent in control surely these things</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.770" end="00:17:57.260" style="s2">don&#39;t really make sense they by side</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.270" end="00:17:59.240" style="s2">yeah so getting them to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.260" end="00:18:01.850" style="s2">they&#39;ve been taking too much</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">responsibility for things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.850" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">actually under their control is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:08.660" style="s2">obvious and integral part of that type</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">of therapy but really it has much more</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.660" end="00:18:13.610" style="s2">pervasive value than that would imply</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:14.870" style="s2">another technique that you can employ a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.610" end="00:18:16.280" style="s2">very simple way of doing that would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.870" end="00:18:18.350" style="s2">just to draw two columns</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.280" end="00:18:20.809" style="s2">describing a situation you&#39;re facing and</p>

<p begin="00:20:52.460" end="00:20:57.289" style="s2">think of it like an arch</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.200" end="00:20:59.090" style="s2">or a Spearman so imagine someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.289" end="00:21:00.529" style="s2">throwing a spear at target and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.090" end="00:21:02.659" style="s2">this example works better if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.529" end="00:21:05.239" style="s2">the target is an animal and the Spearman</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.659" end="00:21:07.070" style="s2">is hunting so he can throw the spear to</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.239" end="00:21:09.019" style="s2">the best of his ability and he&#39;ll aim at</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.070" end="00:21:11.299" style="s2">the target the wild boar that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.019" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">hunting let&#39;s see but he can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.299" end="00:21:15.470" style="s2">if it suddenly darts off in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:18.049" style="s2">direction he might mess it so all that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.470" end="00:21:19.549" style="s2">he can do is what&#39;s under his ability</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.049" end="00:21:21.649" style="s2">under his control to the best of his</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.549" end="00:21:24.049" style="s2">ability and then he has to accept the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.649" end="00:21:27.769" style="s2">outcome whether it&#39;s success or failure</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.049" end="00:21:29.690" style="s2">and that&#39;s sportsman like if you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.769" end="00:21:31.820" style="s2">he&#39;s just doing his best and not</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.690" end="00:21:36.379" style="s2">grumbling if he&#39;s unlucky in the hunt</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.820" end="00:21:38.299" style="s2">for instance and that idea is related to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.379" end="00:21:45.529" style="s2">something that we can also call stoic</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.299" end="00:21:47.659" style="s2">acceptance so Epictetus</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.529" end="00:21:48.919" style="s2">regarding the reserve clause says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.659" end="00:21:51.950" style="s2">like saying I want to do such-and-such</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.919" end="00:21:55.940" style="s2">and at the same time keep my volition my</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.950" end="00:21:58.179" style="s2">will in harmony with nature by accepting</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.940" end="00:22:01.129" style="s2">the outcome even if it doesn&#39;t go my way</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.179" end="00:22:04.279" style="s2">Epictetus also famously said do not seek</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.129" end="00:22:05.809" style="s2">for things to turn out as you desire but</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.279" end="00:22:08.629" style="s2">wish for them to be as you as they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.809" end="00:22:11.269" style="s2">and your life will go smoothly so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.629" end="00:22:12.919" style="s2">is a kind of form of rational acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.269" end="00:22:15.139" style="s2">and the Stoics don&#39;t mean I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.919" end="00:22:17.529" style="s2">passivity by that they mean trying your</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.139" end="00:22:20.149" style="s2">best to do what&#39;s wise and just in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.529" end="00:22:21.830" style="s2">but accepting the reality of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.149" end="00:22:24.679" style="s2">situation would be a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.830" end="00:22:27.470" style="s2">putting it being brutally honest with</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.679" end="00:22:32.470" style="s2">yourself and not grumbling unnecessarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.470" end="00:22:35.419" style="s2">about things but accepting what happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.470" end="00:22:37.190" style="s2">this idea of stoic acceptance cane of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.419" end="00:22:39.409" style="s2">his in some ways and inheritance from</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.190" end="00:22:41.090" style="s2">the cynic concept of voluntary hardship</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.409" end="00:22:42.769" style="s2">which actually reminds me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.090" end="00:22:44.749" style="s2">of the breathing exercise that we just</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.769" end="00:22:46.309" style="s2">did because in modern cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.309" end="00:22:54.259" style="s2">therapy we often teach clients to endure</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.369" style="s2">our voluntary discomfort and that might</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.259" end="00:23:00.619" style="s2">be through holding their breath for</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.369" end="00:23:03.669" style="s2">example and one way one reason for doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.619" end="00:23:07.210" style="s2">that is to teach clients a tolerance of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.669" end="00:23:08.590" style="s2">uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.210" end="00:23:10.539" style="s2">some people are much more intolerant of</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.049" end="00:23:19.179" style="s2">problems but you can train yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.840" end="00:23:21.190" style="s2">become more accepting of discomfort and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.179" end="00:23:22.840" style="s2">Marcus Aurelius rightly says in</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.190" end="00:23:24.789" style="s2">meditations if you do that with one</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.840" end="00:23:26.590" style="s2">feeling you should also tell yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.789" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">the other feelings are just the same</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:36.130" style="s2">can learn to view it as just a sensation</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.090" end="00:23:37.899" style="s2">you can do the same thing when you&#39;re at</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.899" end="00:23:41.260" style="s2">the same as when I was holding breath</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.100" end="00:23:43.029" style="s2">it&#39;s just a different sort of bodily</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.260" end="00:23:46.929" style="s2">sensation or all these bodily sensations</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.029" end="00:23:49.390" style="s2">he says fatigue illness why they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.929" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">the same like the stoic response is</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.390" end="00:23:54.279" style="s2">basically saying that just bodily</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:56.289" style="s2">sensations and we can employ similar</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.279" end="00:23:57.429" style="s2">strategies to cope with them so when</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.289" end="00:23:59.080" style="s2">we&#39;re training those skills on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.429" end="00:24:02.970" style="s2">specific sensation we should think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.080" end="00:24:02.970" style="s2">them as generalizable in other words</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">Marcus says to himself when enduring an</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:13.539" style="s2">says is this unbearable like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.830" end="00:24:15.429" style="s2">challenging himself this sensation when</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.539" end="00:24:18.580" style="s2">taken in isolation is it really</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.429" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">unbearable people tend to say I can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:26.470" style="s2">so he challenges himself to question</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:28.270" style="s2">whether this moment alone is really that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.470" end="00:24:30.940" style="s2">overwhelming is it really too much for</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.270" end="00:24:33.070" style="s2">me because we can tolerate we can bear</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.940" end="00:24:38.770" style="s2">most of these things if we take them one</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.519" end="00:26:50.230" style="s2">that&#39;s particularly prominent for me is</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.809" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what upsets us and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.899" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">Marcus is alluding to when he says life</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:17.559" style="s2">is opinion that it&#39;s not things that</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.559" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">that encapsulates what we call today the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:25.750" style="s2">cognitive model of emotion and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">the basic premise of all cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.750" end="00:27:30.639" style="s2">therapy so Ellis found an easy way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:31.720" style="s2">teach that to clients in therapy was</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.639" end="00:27:33.970" style="s2">just assure them that quote from</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.720" end="00:27:34.750" style="s2">Epictetus and that&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.970" end="00:27:37.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.750" end="00:27:39.430" style="s2">historical intersection between stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.300" end="00:27:41.020" style="s2">and modern cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.430" end="00:27:43.030" style="s2">although I have to say most modern</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.020" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapists that may</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.030" end="00:27:47.020" style="s2">be all they know about the Stoics that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">just that one core unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.020" end="00:27:50.470" style="s2">although they would benefit I think from</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:51.730" style="s2">reading more about stoicism in many</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.470" end="00:27:53.770" style="s2">cases they&#39;ll know that quote from</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.730" end="00:27:56.500" style="s2">Epictetus but maybe literally nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.770" end="00:27:58.390" style="s2">else about stoicism but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.500" end="00:28:03.370" style="s2">important core it is fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.390" end="00:28:06.910" style="s2">stoicism I call it cognitive distancing</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.370" end="00:28:09.160" style="s2">our cognitive catharsis and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.910" end="00:28:12.100" style="s2">mentioned in the Socratic dialogues of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.160" end="00:28:15.490" style="s2">Plato and also in dialogues Xenophon and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.100" end="00:28:17.430" style="s2">so I would I like to thank it make all</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.490" end="00:28:19.930" style="s2">the way back to Socrates himself and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.430" end="00:28:21.670" style="s2">actually Epictetus seems to know that he</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.930" end="00:28:25.150" style="s2">hints at her because in the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.670" end="00:28:27.280" style="s2">sentence his example is Socrates he says</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.150" end="00:28:29.410" style="s2">if death were inherently awful and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.280" end="00:28:32.020" style="s2">fearsome then Socrates would have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.410" end="00:28:34.510" style="s2">frightened of dying but he wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.020" end="00:28:36.850" style="s2">for like the anxiety the terror that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.510" end="00:28:39.100" style="s2">people feel towards death must come from</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.850" end="00:28:41.320" style="s2">their attitude towards her and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.100" end="00:28:44.110" style="s2">the ways that we illustrate the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.320" end="00:28:45.720" style="s2">subjectivity of these emotions the fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.110" end="00:28:48.130" style="s2">that they come from our value judgments</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.720" end="00:28:49.270" style="s2">projected onto things is by asking</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.130" end="00:28:51.040" style="s2">ourselves that other people feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.270" end="00:28:53.650" style="s2">differently about the same situation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.040" end="00:28:55.810" style="s2">that&#39;s an age-old strategy we find that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.650" end="00:28:57.730" style="s2">in Xenophon and Plato as well and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.810" end="00:28:59.500" style="s2">mouths of Socrates if other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.730" end="00:29:01.420" style="s2">aren&#39;t upset by the situation if they</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.500" end="00:29:02.800" style="s2">feel differently about it then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.420" end="00:29:06.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not the situation that&#39;s upsetting</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.800" end="00:29:08.920" style="s2">you maybe it&#39;s your attitude towards it</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.390" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">there are many good examples of this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.920" end="00:29:14.190" style="s2">the Socratic dialogues I think one of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:16.390" style="s2">favorites is in book 1 of the Republic</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.190" end="00:29:18.400" style="s2">which many people believe presents a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.390" end="00:29:21.010" style="s2">more authentic picture of Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.400" end="00:29:23.380" style="s2">was maybe written earlier by Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.010" end="00:29:27.190" style="s2">then it&#39;s Socrates visits a well thief</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.380" end="00:29:29.470" style="s2">elderly man he&#39;s friends with a foreign</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.190" end="00:29:33.700" style="s2">immigrant in Athens called careful us</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.470" end="00:29:35.350" style="s2">and care forces as an old man in</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.700" end="00:29:37.480" style="s2">Socrates hasn&#39;t seen him for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.350" end="00:29:38.890" style="s2">years and he says what careful is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.480" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">just as if I was embarking on a journey</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.890" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">and I met somebody that was returning I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:45.340" style="s2">might ask them what&#39;s the territory like</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:45.970" style="s2">ahead but what&#39;s that things am I gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.340" end="00:29:47.410" style="s2">encounter</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.970" end="00:29:48.350" style="s2">on the rest of my journey because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.410" end="00:29:50.929" style="s2">been ahead of me</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.350" end="00:29:52.490" style="s2">like you&#39;re ahead of me in life like</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.929" end="00:29:54.590" style="s2">because you&#39;re older than me by several</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.490" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">decades what&#39;s it like being unable to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.590" end="00:30:01.130" style="s2">layperson and carefully says to him well</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:03.500" style="s2">I hang around with a lot of other old</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.130" end="00:30:05.210" style="s2">guys because birds of a feather like to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.500" end="00:30:06.440" style="s2">flock together and the one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.210" end="00:30:10.190" style="s2">notice about them is they like to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.440" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">complain by Dawn so what that tells me</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.190" end="00:30:15.860" style="s2">is whether it&#39;s good or bad isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.750" style="s2">matter of the aches and pains or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.860" end="00:30:19.669" style="s2">health problems or other limitations</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.750" end="00:30:21.770" style="s2">that go with old age itself but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.669" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">believe it&#39;s more down to their attitude</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.770" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">that you have towards earth because if</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:28.130" style="s2">it was inherently awful then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:30.200" style="s2">would feel the same way about it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.130" end="00:30:32.330" style="s2">some people are happy in old age there</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.200" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">are positive aspects to it and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.330" end="00:30:37.159" style="s2">mentioned some and he says I&#39;ve got more</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:39.710" style="s2">leisure time to talk with my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.159" end="00:30:41.720" style="s2">so on for example no he says I view it</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.710" end="00:30:43.340" style="s2">in a more positive way so like I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.720" end="00:30:45.049" style="s2">it&#39;s really the attitude that you bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.340" end="00:30:46.429" style="s2">to it and he also says as an aside I</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.049" end="00:30:48.140" style="s2">don&#39;t think these guys have ever been</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.429" end="00:30:49.070" style="s2">happy to be honest and now they&#39;re even</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.830" end="00:33:05.780" style="s2">tend to forget that we confuse our</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.220" end="00:33:12.050" style="s2">episode system is realizing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.500" end="00:33:13.550" style="s2">doing that and actually what the food</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.050" end="00:33:16.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve therapists found was that when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.550" end="00:33:18.830" style="s2">do that rigorously enough you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.250" end="00:33:21.230" style="s2">have to start disputing the evidence for</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.670" end="00:33:31.130" style="s2">less evocative and less disturbing so</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.690" end="00:33:33.140" style="s2">they thought what happens if we just</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.170" end="00:33:45.620" style="s2">thought it was preparation for therapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:48.290" style="s2">but maybe it could be the whole therapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.620" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">and they found that that works about as</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.290" end="00:33:53.390" style="s2">well and in some cases maybe even better</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:54.770" style="s2">than disputing the evidence for negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.390" end="00:33:56.300" style="s2">beliefs and it&#39;s a lot simpler because</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.430" end="00:34:07.580" style="s2">Buddhism but it&#39;s similar to things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.070" end="00:34:09.290" style="s2">happen in meditation so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.580" end="00:34:11.120" style="s2">meditating and thoughts pass through</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.290" end="00:34:12.889" style="s2">your mind you have to gain a certain</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:19.790" style="s2">so this kind of attitude of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.630" end="00:34:21.830" style="s2">and detachment became very important in</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.830" end="00:34:25.940" style="s2">started to draw on Buddhism but</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.490" end="00:34:48.680" style="s2">in stoicism but it was one aspect of</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.030" end="00:34:59.540" style="s2">under the influence of Buddhism so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:01.220" style="s2">like to encourage modern coated paper</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.540" end="00:35:03.740" style="s2">therapists to realize that there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.220" end="00:35:06.190" style="s2">mindfulness practices already in the</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.640" end="00:35:17.090" style="s2">really I wanted to just give you a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.690" end="00:35:18.260" style="s2">sample of some of some of the the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.090" end="00:35:20.360" style="s2">techniques that I think are most</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.260" end="00:35:22.100" style="s2">important and and talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.360" end="00:35:24.260" style="s2">about the practical application give you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.100" end="00:35:27.260" style="s2">a few anecdotes and then I was hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.260" end="00:35:29.240" style="s2">kind of throw open to questions and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.260" end="00:35:31.640" style="s2">see if I can because you guys been</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.240" end="00:35:32.990" style="s2">meditating today so I reckon that your</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.640" end="00:35:37.010" style="s2">questions are going to be really cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.990" end="00:35:40.370" style="s2">and I like to do Q&amp;A so what we throw</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.010" end="00:35:40.750" style="s2">open for Q&amp;A now if you guys already do</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.370" end="00:35:43.829" style="s2">we have</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.020" end="00:36:09.000" style="s2">much for the talk the exercise you were</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.260" end="00:36:11.089" style="s2">mentioning at the end of the distancing</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.000" end="00:36:13.859" style="s2">he reminded me of just the skeptic</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.089" end="00:36:15.690" style="s2">therapeutic program and I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.859" end="00:36:17.730" style="s2">if you could elaborate a bit perhaps on</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.690" end="00:36:18.810" style="s2">your opinion on the downside to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.730" end="00:36:23.070" style="s2">because I think the Stoics would</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.810" end="00:36:25.470" style="s2">disagree that just doing that is healthy</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.070" end="00:36:27.270" style="s2">they would think we should do the second</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.470" end="00:36:30.150" style="s2">step and I guess I want in your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.270" end="00:36:31.770" style="s2">on on that the Stoics can&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.150" end="00:36:33.329" style="s2">suspension or judgment and the same way</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.770" end="00:36:35.490" style="s2">as a skeptics but I suppose what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.329" end="00:36:38.070" style="s2">story could say is that we shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.490" end="00:36:40.200" style="s2">that in relation to virtue they think we</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.070" end="00:36:42.390" style="s2">can grasp the nature of the good of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.200" end="00:36:44.010" style="s2">nature of virtue with certainty and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.390" end="00:36:46.050" style="s2">Marcus actually talks about that in some</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.010" end="00:36:47.400" style="s2">cases he says he talks about applying a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.050" end="00:36:50.359" style="s2">similar technique and he says apply this</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.400" end="00:36:53.099" style="s2">to everything in life except virtue I</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.359" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">and I should mention one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.099" end="00:36:56.700" style="s2">techniques I&#39;ll just mention in passing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">and act clients are taught to take a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.700" end="00:37:00.359" style="s2">problematic statement that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:02.369" style="s2">encapsulates the judgment and to say it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.359" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">really quickly for one minute so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.369" end="00:37:04.619" style="s2">might say everybody hates me everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:05.910" style="s2">hates me everybody hates me everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.619" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">hates me hates me everybody hates</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.910" end="00:37:11.430" style="s2">anybody it&#39;s me hates but everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:13.560" style="s2">hates me hates me hates me hates me</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.430" end="00:37:15.960" style="s2">everybody hates TM becomes really</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.560" end="00:37:19.740" style="s2">awkward very quickly but it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.960" end="00:37:21.990" style="s2">much more aware of it as an activity it</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.740" end="00:37:24.089" style="s2">becomes cumbersome so you become more</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.990" end="00:37:26.130" style="s2">aware of the awkwardness and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.089" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">that you&#39;re actively engaging in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.130" end="00:37:29.310" style="s2">thought you take more ownership for</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:30.750" style="s2">because you&#39;ve made or caused in your</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.310" end="00:37:32.940" style="s2">medium or yourself more self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.750" end="00:37:34.650" style="s2">over that creates cognitive distancing</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.940" end="00:37:36.089" style="s2">and it tends to make people then feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.650" end="00:37:37.800" style="s2">that the thought is less distressing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.089" end="00:37:39.660" style="s2">seems kind of arbitrary to them they go</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.800" end="00:37:41.430" style="s2">well I could say that to myself but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.660" end="00:37:42.930" style="s2">don&#39;t have to it&#39;s like something not</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.430" end="00:37:45.859" style="s2">them it&#39;s a habit I&#39;ve gotten to and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.930" end="00:37:45.859" style="s2">could just stop seeing up</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.510" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">thank you so much for your talk Donald I</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.620" end="00:37:54.310" style="s2">actually a question that I guess kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:58.600" style="s2">builds off of that but you talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.310" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">bit about how comparing act versus CVT</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.600" end="00:38:03.430" style="s2">you said there&#39;s like interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:05.950" style="s2">evidence and different populations who</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.430" end="00:38:07.570" style="s2">benefit more from not cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.950" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">challenging every single thought as</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.570" end="00:38:11.530" style="s2">opposed to this like radical acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:13.870" style="s2">kind of piece and how you you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.530" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">some benefit and I just I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.870" end="00:38:17.950" style="s2">hear your thoughts on like what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:19.330" style="s2">people benefit more from that or like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.950" end="00:38:21.700" style="s2">what the rationale is for someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.330" end="00:38:23.410" style="s2">benefiting less from constantly</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.700" end="00:38:24.820" style="s2">cognitively like challenging each</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.410" end="00:38:26.590" style="s2">thought and like evidence for evidence</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.820" end="00:38:27.790" style="s2">guys versus just to like the radical</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.590" end="00:38:29.800" style="s2">acceptance in what you&#39;re and when</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.790" end="00:38:31.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen that work the research or</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.800" end="00:38:33.640" style="s2">not the stell emerging research or not</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.630" end="00:38:36.520" style="s2">but the short answer to is that most CBT</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.640" end="00:38:38.740" style="s2">practitioners will say the clients with</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.520" end="00:38:40.870" style="s2">generalized anxiety disorder or certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.740" end="00:38:43.360" style="s2">obsessive compulsive clients sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.870" end="00:38:45.940" style="s2">find it difficult to do traditional CBT</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.360" end="00:38:47.320" style="s2">because I mean to put it very glibly and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.940" end="00:38:48.730" style="s2">just give you an example and CBT you</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.320" end="00:38:51.010" style="s2">give a client a flop form a take home</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.730" end="00:38:52.180" style="s2">and you go right down what Forte&#39;s went</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.010" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">through your mind and then in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.180" end="00:38:55.900" style="s2">little column jot down the evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:57.790" style="s2">and against and some of the GED clients</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.900" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">have generalized anxiety disorder which</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.790" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">is called it&#39;s basically pathological</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:02.290" style="s2">worrying they&#39;ll come back for the next</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:03.910" style="s2">session and go you told me it write</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.290" end="00:39:06.940" style="s2">stuff down so I&#39;ve written ten pages</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.910" end="00:39:09.580" style="s2">well in thoughts went through my mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.940" end="00:39:10.780" style="s2">you go okay no you&#39;re like massively</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.580" end="00:39:12.580" style="s2">overthinking it</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.780" end="00:39:14.470" style="s2">right so for them the process of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.580" end="00:39:16.990" style="s2">thinking becomes sticky because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.470" end="00:39:18.670" style="s2">so fused with her why and so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.990" end="00:39:21.250" style="s2">desperate ation itself becomes something</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.670" end="00:39:23.350" style="s2">that they become to a milestone why and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.250" end="00:39:24.820" style="s2">so we need to can I&#39;ll teach them to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.350" end="00:39:26.770" style="s2">able to take a step back from that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.820" end="00:39:29.410" style="s2">not get swept away by their thoughts as</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.770" end="00:39:32.080" style="s2">much and you know it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.410" end="00:39:33.850" style="s2">correspond to particular diagnosis you</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.080" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">know although some are more problematic</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.850" end="00:39:37.270" style="s2">than others maybe you just be certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:39.100" style="s2">personality types aren&#39;t really suited</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.270" end="00:39:40.690" style="s2">to disputation because they they get too</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.100" end="00:39:42.430" style="s2">lost in the weeds basically and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.690" end="00:39:46.500" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s helpful to do something</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.430" end="00:39:46.500" style="s2">that that&#39;s less discursive</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.020" end="00:39:53.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just a question on the is the sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.880" end="00:39:56.290" style="s2">of the spirituality side of it how much</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.800" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">for you is it stoicism and she be purely</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.290" end="00:40:00.700" style="s2">a technique to overcome psychological</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:01.990" style="s2">issues and how much of it is there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.700" end="00:40:07.840" style="s2">there a spiritual religious element to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.990" end="00:40:10.090" style="s2">stoicism well I&#39;m an agnostic right but</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.840" end="00:40:12.010" style="s2">I got into all of this stuff because as</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.090" end="00:40:14.740" style="s2">a teenager I was interested in Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.010" end="00:40:16.690" style="s2">and world religions and Nakata long</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.740" end="00:40:18.430" style="s2">story short it was studying Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.690" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">that led me to Neoplatonism that led me</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.430" end="00:40:23.770" style="s2">to stoicism violin or Styx basically so</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:25.090" style="s2">that&#39;s that was my background bringing</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.770" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">me into him when I was at university</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.090" end="00:40:27.580" style="s2">studying philosophy I also studied</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:29.050" style="s2">history of religions</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.580" end="00:40:32.260" style="s2">I studied I studied Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.050" end="00:40:35.470" style="s2">Hinduism so I I do kind of have that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.260" end="00:40:37.570" style="s2">perspective but over the years I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.470" end="00:40:40.020" style="s2">more into Greek philosophy I guess in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.570" end="00:40:43.600" style="s2">sense my outlook has become secularized</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.020" end="00:40:45.910" style="s2">although I guess in a sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.600" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">telling me I do I find it hard to kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.910" end="00:40:50.470" style="s2">of draw the line as to you know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:52.090" style="s2">would qualify as mysticism Bertrand</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.470" end="00:40:53.410" style="s2">Russell that says maybe this is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.090" end="00:40:54.820" style="s2">indirect way of answering your question</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.410" end="00:40:57.910" style="s2">Bertrand Russell who was famously an</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.820" end="00:41:00.040" style="s2">atheist said that he considered studying</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.910" end="00:41:02.140" style="s2">the whole of human history and an</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.040" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">overview the closest that he could</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.140" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">imagine to a religious experience and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:08.140" style="s2">that reminds me of the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:10.360" style="s2">so I think the view from above even if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.140" end="00:41:13.300" style="s2">approach and I can a secular rational</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.360" end="00:41:15.550" style="s2">way cane a quasi mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.300" end="00:41:16.990" style="s2">perhaps and some people tell me they say</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.550" end="00:41:18.730" style="s2">Donald you&#39;re a mystic because you rent</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.990" end="00:41:20.500" style="s2">all this kind of stuff and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.730" end="00:41:21.850" style="s2">I offer really view it that way then I</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.500" end="00:41:23.980" style="s2">think maybe we&#39;re just kind of mincing</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.850" end="00:41:25.660" style="s2">words or whatever so if you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.980" end="00:41:27.640" style="s2">that kind of mystical or a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.660" end="00:41:29.970" style="s2">aspect then I guess I&#39;m good with our</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.640" end="00:41:32.260" style="s2">although I tend to think of it more as</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.970" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">philosophy and our rational way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.260" end="00:41:40.320" style="s2">viewing things we don&#39;t yeah cool okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:40.320" style="s2">thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.010" end="00:41:43.439" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
