<p begin="00:00:21.439" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">uh we had a very good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.600" end="00:00:28.000" style="s2">on your show a couple of years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:29.439" style="s2">we had planned to uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:31.279" style="s2">to meet on this side of the pond and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.439" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">then uh kovid hit</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.279" end="00:00:35.200" style="s2">and uh interrupted our plans to meet so</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:37.760" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do this remotely which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.200" end="00:00:39.520" style="s2">the new face to face</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.760" end="00:00:41.200" style="s2">sounds good to me so how have things</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.520" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.200" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">things have been good um well</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">personally things are fine politically</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:48.640" style="s2">things are completely and utterly</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">screwed up</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.640" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">um you know the thing that i&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:54.960" style="s2">most surprising and shocking</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">and disappointing about the current</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.960" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">moment or the past few months</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:03.440" style="s2">is the fact that the covid crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:06.400" style="s2">has exacerbated all the trends and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.440" end="00:01:08.320" style="s2">ideologies that people like you and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:09.520" style="s2">are worried about and i thought it might</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.320" end="00:01:13.119" style="s2">have the opposite effect</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.520" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">i thought a genuine threat to health or</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.119" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">you know a serious problem facing</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">societies might galvanize people to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">focus on things that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">important like health the economy</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:26.479" style="s2">ensuring that everyone has a good life</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:28.240" style="s2">and make them forget all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.479" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">nonsense and crap that they&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">spouting for the previous five to ten to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">twenty years but it&#39;s had the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">effect all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">seems to have intensified over the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">few months which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">very disconcerting well i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">part of a more general pattern</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve seen many events that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">could have galvanized us but that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">in our system that causes these</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">opportunities to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">missed automatically and for us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:57.759" style="s2">descend</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">further into madness which um is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.759" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">pattern we need to notice but we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">certainly saw it</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">with 911 we saw it with</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">katrina over here in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">certainly with covid the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">existed but</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">was quickly lost and so anyway we seem</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">to be as you point out just hurtling</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">faster in the same direction and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">the disaster that will arise is uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">completely predictable if not with</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">precision certainly with a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">degree of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">of accuracy so uh what do you make of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">why do these potentially galvanizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">result in uh further derangement</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">i think um i think people struggle to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">of dangerous things at the moment i mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.400" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">you you mentioned 911 that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">example of this because</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">in a different era an attack like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">might have been understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">in a political way um as</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">you know a specific threat a threat that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">needed to be dealt with from a group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">people who needed to be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">it would have been viewed primarily in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">that fashion</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">but what happened with 911 in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">current era when it happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">is that it unleashed or intensified all</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">the backward</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">reactionary deranged trends that had</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">already been gathering pace i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">very clear example of that is conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">which very swiftly took over from</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">rational discussion in some quarters and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">we were suddenly led to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">george bush did this not al qaeda israel</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">was probably involved in all these other</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">theories that floated around</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">in the absence of a framework through</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">which to make sense of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">and the absence of a framework at work</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">or the absence of a shared common</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:50.319" style="s2">outlook or a common language is often</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.319" end="00:03:53.519" style="s2">i i think is the starting point of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">derangement</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.519" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">of the current moment and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">in the aftermath of something like 911</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">and of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">there was also a lot of the politics of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:04.519" style="s2">fear um</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">there was a panic there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.519" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">authoritarianism there were very</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">various illiberal laws not only in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">us but in the united kingdom too</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">in terms of spying on people restricting</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">what you&#39;re allowed to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">um and so on and so forth so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">i find it very interesting the way in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">which world events or problematic events</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">threats to our societies</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">the thing we seem to struggle with is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">a common way to understand them and talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">about them and instead</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">it fractures very quickly and you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">these competing claims as to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">what is the real origin of this event</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">what is the real meaning of it what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">the real impact of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">i think with covid what i find quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">striking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">the covid situation is that i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">um it was less the threat from covert</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">intensified the derangement and more the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">because what the lockdown we had a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">lockdown in the united kingdom it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">supposed to be for three weeks it ended</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">up being</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">closer to four months um of course there</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">were lockdowns in europe there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">various forms of locking down in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">different american states</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">and what the lockdown did it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">intensified the atomization of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">it complete in the united kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">context it completely broke</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">up the public there was no longer any</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">existing public instead we were all</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">broken up and any sense of collectivity</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">was completely undermined</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">we saw the intensification of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">particularly that very atomized</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">individuated</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">those were the things that intensified</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">most during the lockdown period and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">that the lockdown only really ended in</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">the uk anyway</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">with the black lives matter protests</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">which was really an explosion</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">of identitarian politics an explosion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">what i would consider to be regressive</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">politics a very destructive illiberal</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">censorious moments statues were torn</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">down statues were defaced</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">comedy shows were banned um people were</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">forced to take the knee and if they</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t they were humiliated in public</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">ritually humiliated for days on end so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.520" style="s2">striking to me that lockdown only came</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">to an end with this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.520" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">physical manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">identitarian</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">regressive politics and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">really demonstrated to me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">that the thing that intensified during</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">the lockdown moment was</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">primarily the the cult of identity which</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">i think is going to get worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">so uh if i understand you correctly</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">that the atomization of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">uh our collective sense being broken</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">apart physically from each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">resulted in an obsessive focus on</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">identity because the things that tend to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">blur that line</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">are connections to other people whose</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">identity may be related</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">but isn&#39;t the same so i see a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">on the other hand there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">something to be said</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">for the fact that people have over time</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">innovated new modes</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">and you know as much as</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">zoom is lacking for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">in some of the face-to-face sense people</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">have defaulted to it and so i see</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">simultaneously people being atomized and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">also people coming together in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">they were reluctant to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">before not maybe that because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">meaning of physical proximity anymore</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">due to the fact that we are you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">even if we&#39;re down the street from</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">somebody we may still</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">do a conference call with them that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">may um it may allow us to choose</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">too much who it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">interacting with so that we may</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">or at least some of us may default into</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">finding people whose identity is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">and therefore creating um</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">identitarian echo chambers</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s very true and um</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know social media and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">these other technological breakthroughs</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">are a double-edged sword in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">in the sense that they allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">communicate in ways that our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">could only have dreamt of i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">know it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">it makes the printing revolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">15 and 1600s look like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">minor affair the fact that pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">anyone on earth who has a mobile phone</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">can publish his or her views</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">with no need for an editor no need for a</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">them what they may or may not say</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:33.279" style="s2">although social media the social media</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">oligarchs are now taking over that role</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.279" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">increasingly and are now saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">there are certain things you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">publicly but</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">that&#39;s an incredibly radical moment the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">internet revolution was an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">radical moment unprecedented in human</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">history and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">all to the good but what&#39;s happened i</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">think with technology in particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">is that it has molded itself around</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">cultural trends that were pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">and so i&#39;m always reluctant to engage</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">in technological determinism i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">technology makes us the way we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">in some instances in some historical</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">moments that may well be the case but i</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">most of the time technology we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">get the technology we deserve as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">society so you know in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">earlier periods the technology was</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">you know ships that were capable of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">traversing entire oceans because</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">that moment was one of exploration and</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">the expansion of human knowledge or the</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">which tended to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">a sense of aspiration a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">ambition a sense of desire amongst</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">technology that&#39;s that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">live in our bubbles which which allows</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">us to</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">our identitarian impulses in a public</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">and to as you say create echo chambers</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">and reinforce our existing views and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">protect</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">technology is now very good</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">at protecting the individual from</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">so the great irony i think in modern</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">online is that it creates the lonely</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">very much as atomized individuals</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">what technology has done it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">shaped itself around the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">regressive trends that had been taking</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">hold for</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">the past few decades and i think one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">the striking things about the covid</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">period is there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">a lot of connection people did try to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">make connections during the lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">in the uk for example there were lots of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">local groups who were doing shopping for</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">people and looking after the elderly</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">there was one where i live and i was</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:23.760" style="s2">involved in that and people</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">really did want to have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.760" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">taking some collective responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:30.399" style="s2">for their</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">fellow citizens but the speed with which</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">that got pushed aside by all the old</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">rubbish i thought was so striking so</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">very quickly the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">the pandemic was racialized for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">we were told</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">it has a disproportionate impact on</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">black people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">south asian people which may be true</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:53.120" style="s2">for various reasons but it was the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">intensity of the racialization and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.120" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">way it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">folded into the victim narrative i</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">thought was very striking</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">um of course we&#39;ve seen the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">censorship there are now certain things</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to say about covid on</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">youtube or on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">and other platforms um and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">and as i say the explosion of uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">identity politics which i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">really reached its crescendo after the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">murder of george floyd</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i found depressing about</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">covert and very</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">interesting about the moment we live in</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">there was a collective impulse there</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">were people saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">we have to pull together but they were</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">conquered by</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">the continuing assertion of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">regressive trends of our time</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">and i find that quite worrying well if i</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">hunt around in that formulation for</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">maybe a slightly different one you say</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">we tend to get the technology that we as</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">a society deserve</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">i&#39;m reluctant about this because you</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">point out uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">you know ocean-going ships and the age</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">of exploration for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">uh well that brought smallpox</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">and conquistadors to the new world and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">can&#39;t say that there&#39;s anything that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">going on in the new world that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">uh suggests that they deserved that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:08.959" style="s2">was just sort of an arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">consequence</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.959" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">of um a new capacity to travel</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">on the other hand i think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:20.320" style="s2">saying is</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">that there&#39;s an amplifier</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">which takes our characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">increases their amplitude to an</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">extraordinary degree</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">and one of the places that i see this</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">is you know covet occurring at this</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">and interfacing with the identitarian</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">politics seems to have brought</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">the dumbest version of marxism that i</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">think the world has ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">which you know is saying something</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">because there have been quite a number</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">of very dumb versions and i i say this</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">with some trepidation because i know um</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">that at least last time we spoke</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">you regarded yourself as a marxist of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">trotskyian stripe which i know is a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">version it&#39;s a very different view but</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">nonetheless what we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">at the moment is almost like social</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">marxism</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">and you know this has been said by</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">various people in various ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">obviously jordan peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:28.560" style="s2">called it cultural marxism but i guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">the point is there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.560" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">like it&#39;s a marxism of opinion</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">that has downgraded leadership</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">and supplanted it with like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:43.440" style="s2">spitballing session</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">in which no idea is too stupid to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">eliminated from the group does that make</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">yes that does make sense um you know one</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:54.959" style="s2">one of the things i am most unpopular</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">for is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.959" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">um i&#39;m all i always feel uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">the description of the current political</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">trends as marxism</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">um and that&#39;s not because i think we</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">have to defend marxism as this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">pure</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">thing from history which was wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">and unquestionable and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">you know never let it be sullied or</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">anything like that my view is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">marxism is done and dusted as an</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">it had some good ideas it had some bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">ideas and it didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">and so i&#39;m pretty happy that to say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:29.199" style="s2">that is part of history and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that politics is coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.199" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">back and what makes me uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:35.920" style="s2">um the use of that word to describe</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:37.519" style="s2">what&#39;s going on at the moment the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.920" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">i often make to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.519" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">um right-wing friends of mine or</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">anti-communist friends of mine you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">have to be on the right to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">anti-communist by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.560" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">the point i offer make to them which</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.560" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">infuriates them i have no</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">doubt is that um if it&#39;s marxism</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:57.440" style="s2">you&#39;re worried about you should actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">be delighted by the rise of identity</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.440" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">politics because</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">i see identity politics in particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">but also</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">the politics of environmentalism which</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">is an even more</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">controversial claim i see those two</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">forms of politics</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">as pretty hardcore proof</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">that marxism as a project or the left as</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">it was traditionally constituted</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">no longer really exists because</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">those two things identity politics and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:29.520" style="s2">green politics those two things in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">particular seem to me to run so</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.520" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">obviously counter to what the left was</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">traditionally about</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">so in the round the left was about</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">collectivity it was about class in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">it was about what we had in common</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">workers of the world unite to use an old</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">and if anyone reads karl marx&#39;s writings</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">about thomas</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">malthus thomas malthus was the notorious</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">late 1700s early 1800s population</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">theorizer who said that there was not</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">enough food</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">to feed the world and we would all</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">starve to death</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">he failed to foresee the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">revolution because he was a pessimist</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">and did not believe that mankind would</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">capable of something like the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">revolution so he was completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">and marx&#39;s writings on malthus are very</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">interesting because he</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">says the problem with this politics is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">that it naturalizes poverty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:48.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a libel against the human race</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">because it presents poverty as a natural</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.559" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">thing whereas the left&#39;s belief</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.559" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">is that poverty is a function of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">an unequal society and therefore can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">overcome by changing society</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">so you know a very rough estimation of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">marxist left-wing politics used to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">about would be to say that it was about</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">collective bonds and um the the progress</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">of society through</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">economic growth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">both of those things strike me as being</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">completely absent from the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">left so they have no interest in</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:25.880" style="s2">collectivity they&#39;re very much</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">obsessed with group identity it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.880" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">extraordinarily divisive</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">movement it&#39;s very very fragmentary so</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">not only is it black versus white but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s now black versus black where you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">have the debates about</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">colorism and how light-skinned black</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">people have it better than</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">dark-skinned black people um the gay</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">movement is now split apart by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">the rise of the trans ideology um</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">white women are constantly told by black</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">lives and they&#39;ve sold their souls to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">the patriarchy so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">divisive movement but the one that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">becomes more divisive</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">all the time so i don&#39;t see that as</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">being a collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">form of politics in the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">left traditionally was</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">and of course the contemporary left is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:14.080" style="s2">very very down on economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">um you know they idolize people like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.080" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">greta thundberg</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">and her rather doom laden message about</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">the dangers of economic growth and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">need to stop economic growth which is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">very easy thing for</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">an upper middle class schoolgirl from</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">the north of europe to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">i&#39;m sure the three billion people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">still live in poverty would have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">point of view so this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">kind of loses me friends sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">because they think i&#39;m defending marxism</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">but i&#39;m not what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">what i&#39;m more interested in what&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">what&#39;s new about today</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">and what&#39;s different and i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">sometimes we fall back on</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">the language of the 20th century to try</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">and negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">negotiate our way through the very</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">strange</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">unpredictable 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">and i think that can end up making</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">even more confusing than they are that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">makes sense oh it does</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:10.240" style="s2">um the the tragedy of the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">really incredible because</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.240" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">you know as you point out for some</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">reason there doesn&#39;t seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">vibrant left</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">that which takes the mantle of the left</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">is regressive at best and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">really i think manifesting a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:27.520" style="s2">collective psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:28.400" style="s2">that isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t belong on any</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.520" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:34.640" style="s2">political map it&#39;s just vindictive</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">and insane</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">but at the same time we know a great</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">deal now</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">about what could</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">work if we could find ourselves driven</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">collectively</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">to seek it in other words i think we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">say a great deal theoretically for</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">example about</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">why marxism is such an attractive idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">but devolves in one of two directions</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">inherently um and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:10.000" style="s2">in light of that we can move on from</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">it it&#39;s a very um as you say it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.000" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">well you didn&#39;t exactly say but we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">consign it to the dustbin of history as</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">an experiment that&#39;s now been</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">run enough times that we know these</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">things and we could seek</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">um frankly a very different kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">of forward-looking</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">plan for humanity in other words i i</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">in some sense what has kept us stable</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">is a tension between left and right</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">because it was the best regulator we</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">could come up with that both left and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">are prone to excesses and the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">we could do to modulate them</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">was allow each one to control the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">enough that we didn&#39;t fall off either of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">two cliffs that they suggested but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">can do better than that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">now we now understand uh where we</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">are we understand ourselves um enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">that we can explore the question of in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">light of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">the values that most of us share</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">what system is it that realizes those</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">at the highest rate with the least</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">carnage and we could pursue it which</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">you know that&#39;s you could hear that as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:23.440" style="s2">idea you could hear that as an attempt</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.440" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">to liberate individuals and it is in</p>

<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">but the sad thing is we won&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">because at some level</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">we&#39;re too busy bludgeoning each other</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">all look dead yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good description of where</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">we&#39;re at at the moment and i think um</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">i see us i think we&#39;re living through</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">the death rattle</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">off the end of left right politics we</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">haven&#39;t escaped</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">the ripple off the falling apart of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.799" style="s2">political system because</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">you&#39;re right you know left right was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.799" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">balance through which</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">almost everything was understood for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">very long period</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">of time really from the french</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">revolution onwards when they split</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">the revolutionary parliament between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">left side and the right side</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">um political life was governed by that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">global affairs was governed by that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">there was the west there was the east</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">and within countries themselves people</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">were split along similar lines and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">institutions emerged which gave</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:30.840" style="s2">expression to that divide</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">working men&#39;s groups conservative</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.840" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">associations republican groups etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">um so when that falls apart or when left</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">and right loses its</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">meaning or loses its direction i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">that has a knock-on effect which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">still being felt and if we you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">lots of people talk about the end of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">left and right particularly</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">at the end of the 20th century when the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">with the fall of the soviet union and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">the knock-on effect that has on</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.840" style="s2">left-wing parties across the west who</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">kind of become pretty pointless at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">i still think we&#39;re living through the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">the aftermath of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">falling apart and we&#39;re still struggling</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">to find a new language through which to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">humanity&#39;s needs and how they might best</p>

<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">and best enacted i think what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">ended up with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">often is a left-right politics which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">very much a pantomime</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">um a shouting match uh it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:28.080" style="s2">any of the substance or the si or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">seriousness of what it did in the past</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.080" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">you have right-wing panto villains who</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">looked upon as just evil everyone&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">according to the kind of infantile left</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">have no understanding of how much they</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">are engaging in holocaust relativism</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">when they compare everything that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">happens today with what happened</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">in the 1930s um and the right is guilty</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">of this too the right will</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:55.760" style="s2">you know there are some right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">libertarians in the us who i meet</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.760" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">who think that any form of collective</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">politics is basically leninism you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">they will tell me that the national</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">health service in the uk i have many</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">criticisms of the national health</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">service but they think</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">even collectivized health is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">the russian revolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">you know and so they engage in that kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">pantomime politics too without stopping</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">to think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">the substance of what they&#39;re saying i</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:23.840" style="s2">think one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">striking things about today and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.840" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">really worth thinking about this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">extent to which</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">the left has become like the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">used to be um in this uh and i mean a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">particular form of the right if you go</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">back to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">20th century particularly the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">mid-20th century</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">um there were sections of the right that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">were very um</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">shrill illiberal censorious</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:54.159" style="s2">i&#39;m just about old enough to remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">when the people who wanted things banned</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.159" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">tended to be right wingers they tended</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">conservative christians they tended to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">be people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">who literally could not sleep because</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">they were so obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">pieces of art like um piss christ for</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">um or who wanted to ban any exhibition</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">of art that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">lewd or salacious or grotesque</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">um one of the first things i did when i</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">was very young</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">i got involved in a campaign to defend a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">computer game</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.000" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">launched in the uk the computer game was</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">called carmageddon</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">and it was basically a game which</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">allowed you to drive your car around and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">kill people and mow them down and it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">very bloody and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">actually very good fun and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">the people who wanted it banned were</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">conservative christian right-wing lobby</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">and that was really the last hurrah of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">their movement that&#39;s kind of the mid</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">90s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">and today you fast forward to today and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.760" style="s2">the people who are at the forefront</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">i think some on the right still favor</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.760" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">censorship</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">but the people who are at the forefront</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">of the new censorship or the or the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">desire to ban anything any piece of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">culture or any piece of entertainment or</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">any individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">like brett weinstein who doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">their mold</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">the people at the forefront of that tend</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">to be ostensibly left-wing people</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">ostensibly radical people</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">who now act and speak very much like</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">helmet-haired christian ladies who</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">wanted to ban</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">everything that offended them in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">20th century so</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:36.960" style="s2">that shift is also very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">and it speaks to how disorientated</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.960" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">political life in the west has become</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">and i think one of the great challenges</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">of our time is not simply to confront</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">this regressive politics every time it</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">expresses itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">as a kind of um that&#39;s quite a defensive</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">mechanism i think it&#39;s important to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">defensive and to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">to fight them every time they raise</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">their heads and and say or do something</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">but at the same time we have to start</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">developing a language</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">and a politics that is capable of taking</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">us beyond</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">um the left right pantomime</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">and into an era in which people can give</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">expression to their viewpoints in a way</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">that makes sense and in a way that could</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:22.480" style="s2">impact positively on human life and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.399" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">think the discovery of that new</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">but the irony is we can&#39;t get there</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">we are suffering the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:08.320" style="s2">um the loss of the role of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">that leadership</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">has been demoted to the status of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">influencer and that the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">influencer</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">is a producer consumer</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">modality and the consumer is at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">point that a leader</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">might tell you something that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">want to hear but you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">a an influencer may say it and people</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">will switch to some influencer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">less likely to cause them angst</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">and that that that loss of leaders is</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">resulting</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">in you know just the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">foolish beliefs rising as if</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">they are new as if they have</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">meaningful content as if they can even</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">be spelled out</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">in some sort of consistent form that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">would allow you to evaluate them when</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:03.279" style="s2">in each case they run through your</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">i i think the the crisis of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">is actually key to a lot of this because</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">the thing that is is very striking</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">is um you know a lot of the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">woke mob</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">or all these these gangs of social media</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">vigilantes who go after anyone who says</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">something disagreeable</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">you know they they are quite scary in</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.840" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">the sense that they are obviously</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">unhinged i mean there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">problem here i mean they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">often quite hateful individuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.200" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">i get the most obscene emails from</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">people like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">threatening things and saying things</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">are really objectionable um and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">behave in a very very bad way if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">um jk rowling for example who&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">abuse at the moment because she believes</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">in biological sex which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">blasphemy in in the woke era</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">you know they do things they send her</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">pornographic pictures</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">or if she posts a tweet about a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">book and lots of children respond to her</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">these people will post pornographic</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">pictures in those discussion threads</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">this is not normal behavior this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">unhinged</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">regressive incredibly anti-human</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">anti-social behavior so they are</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">sometimes quite scary but but the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">striking thing about them is that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">they&#39;re often very small in number so</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">when i&#39;ve encountered controversies on</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">at british universities where there have</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">been groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">protesting against a visit of mine for</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s they&#39;re always fairly</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">they&#39;re always quite socially awkward</p>

<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">human beings so the question i always</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">ask myself is how is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">that these mobs of strange people have</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">such a big influence and i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually nailed it it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">interplay between</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">the um the vociferous nature of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">people and their sensorious desires it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">the interplay of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">with the crisis of leadership and with</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">the crisis of institutions</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">and i think one of the main players in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.560" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">the current climate is</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">institutional cowardice the way in which</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">roll over as soon as seven people</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">all it takes is for a handful of people</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.880" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">um connection between those two things</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">rushmore speech</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">recently um on the fourth of july</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">and he talked about cancel culture it</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">was actually a really good speech</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">i have no idea who wrote it i&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">sure trump didn&#39;t write it but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">really good speech</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">not very well delivered um but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">really good speech and it was so</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">striking that he</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">this was the first time a major</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">politician had said things like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">where he said they want to cancel the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">american revolution they want to cancel</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">the ideas of western civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely correct</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">and so um if more people did what trump</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">did at mount rushmore</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">i think we&#39;d probably be in a better</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">position so</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a really key point and i think um</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">what&#39;s becoming more and more clear over</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:15.040" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">is that this is an assault on western</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">and if you look at the mania of the past</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">you know on the surface it looks like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">attack on confederate statues or statues</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">of slave owners and</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">is absolutely essential to stand up to</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">the cowardice is breathtaking and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">know it&#39;s rooted in a very simple</p>

<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">and so what&#39;s happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">corporations individuals colleges are</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">all making the same calculation which is</p>

<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">and it is um you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">a hundred percent right about the attack</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:17.599" style="s2">on western civilization and the funny</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.599" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">i remember the moment at which i became</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:28.480" style="s2">during the evergreen meltdown i</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">detected that this was what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">said out loud i believe it was in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">faculty meeting</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">that not only was this</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">an attack on the institution but this</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">this was really an attack</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">on not only the enlightenment but the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">concept of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">and what came back was not</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">the denial that i expected it was an</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">embrace of what i had just said and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">idea was</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">right enlightenment is a white people</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s bad it is you know the root of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">slavery and all other you know sins</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">and therefore we are right to tear it</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">down and i just thought my</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">god what are what are we playing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">here you know we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">at root dealing with whether we will</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">have any agreement</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">that would allow us to establish even a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">single claim</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">on some basis other than power right</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">you know we saw on twitter very recently</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">a battle over whether two plus two</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">actually equals</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">four and of course that has a history in</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">literature but the fact that people were</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.200" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">actually earnestly</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">arguing this tells us where we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">and it has caused me to think the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">thought i don&#39;t think almost anybody is</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">this dumb</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">right i don&#39;t think as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">these are tiny</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:57.359" style="s2">movements but they&#39;re not even it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:58.800" style="s2">even this tiny number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.359" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">believes these things i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.800" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">almost nobody believes these things and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">that in effect they are like</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">a uniform and they are simply declaring</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">i am with those people</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">and the fact is what&#39;s frightening is i</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">am with those people those people may</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">well have the power to uninvent</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">the question is really one of net effect</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">there are obviously major structural</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">and so uninventing it over</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">that which it has not attained is</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">lunacy and yet uh</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">in which ideas like time keeping are</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">but you know um if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">one of the interesting consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">the turn against western history and the</p>

<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">is the obsession with slavery i think</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:23.040" style="s2">but i remember at the age of 16 and 17</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:26.799" style="s2">when i was losing my faith i&#39;d be</p>

<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">and a scarier scale in relation to</p>

<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">and cancelled and i think that&#39;s such a</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something about it i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:10.880" style="s2">figure out what the formulation is</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">but many people have invoked a religious</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot to it but</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something so juvenile about the</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.799" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">what it is the idea is that this</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">handed down and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.799" end="00:57:38.240" style="s2">in effect treating it as true is</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.240" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">but in the case of any new belief system</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:45.440" style="s2">there has to be a skepticism about to</p>

<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">john stuart mill makes this point in on</p>

<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">is by subjecting your ideas to as as</p>

<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">as debate as possible exposing them to</p>

<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">but also it will allow you to sharpen</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.200" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">your argument to deepen your argument to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:36.960" style="s2">make it</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">clearer to make it more substantial</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.960" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">but what we have at the moment in in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:42.240" style="s2">culture of the echo chamber and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:44.559" style="s2">culture of the safe space</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:46.079" style="s2">is the precise opposite of that that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.559" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">have this pathological</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.079" end="01:01:50.400" style="s2">unwillingness to subject our belief</p>

<p begin="01:01:50.400" end="01:01:55.520" style="s2">public confrontation because apparently</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:58.799" style="s2">that would be a form of eurasia</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.520" end="01:02:01.039" style="s2">that would hurt us you know words wound</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.799" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">um you know public debate is now</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.039" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">understood as a form of assault</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.280" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">you know words are akin to violence</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">seen so everything is done everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:13.280" style="s2">possible is done to protect</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">our beliefs from any form of challenge</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.280" end="01:02:16.559" style="s2">and so of course what happens is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">they become dogma</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.559" end="01:02:20.880" style="s2">because if you believe something just</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:24.559" style="s2">rather than because you have tested it</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:25.839" style="s2">then that&#39;s not a belief at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.559" end="01:02:28.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a dogma</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.839" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">it&#39;s something it&#39;s rigid it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.480" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">unflinching it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:36.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s unreal</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">so i think the certitude as you describe</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.000" end="01:02:39.760" style="s2">it of these</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:42.640" style="s2">um you know six-year-olds</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.760" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">is really that certitude is a function</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.640" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">of the censorship that they live under</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">and which they impose on others and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">which they uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">the force feel they put around</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">themselves because they&#39;re so terrified</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.599" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">of being exposed</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:58.880" style="s2">as talking nonsense and the danger you</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">know so that&#39;s bad for them censorship</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.880" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">makes you stupid</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what it does it turns you into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">child because you</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">constantly believe that you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">protected from ideas so censorship makes</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:10.880" style="s2">you stupid but it has an even worse</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:14.839" style="s2">effect on society more broadly</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.880" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">which is it really dulls intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.839" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">and it it really um undermines the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:22.480" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">in which new ideas might be discovered</p>

<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:34.160" style="s2">to flourish um you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:35.680" style="s2">george bernard shaw made this point i</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.160" end="01:03:39.359" style="s2">quote it often</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.680" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">um all great truths begin as blasphemies</p>

<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">important i mean if you think about all</p>

<p begin="01:04:43.599" end="01:04:46.799" style="s2">soapboxes they could stand up in</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.119" end="01:04:48.799" style="s2">universities and</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">and assert the non-existence of god</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.799" end="01:04:53.520" style="s2">which um</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">shelley did at oxford um in the 1800s</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.520" end="01:04:57.119" style="s2">and he was expelled</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">he wrote a pamphlet on the necessity of</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.119" end="01:05:00.319" style="s2">atheism and he was expelled from oxford</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">for doing so</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.319" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">these days you could be expelled from</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:06.240" style="s2">oxford for publishing i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.839" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">a sexist pamphlet or a transphobic</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.240" end="01:05:11.039" style="s2">pamphlet or something else</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">so um at some level the conditions</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.039" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">existed in which people could experiment</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.760" style="s2">intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">and express blasphemous ideas which they</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.760" end="01:05:20.559" style="s2">believed to be progressive and</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:22.480" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.559" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">i think the conditions for doing that</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.480" end="01:05:29.440" style="s2">have have rarely been</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:31.599" style="s2">as um undermined as they are right now</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.440" end="01:05:34.000" style="s2">it is very difficult now for people to</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.599" end="01:05:36.400" style="s2">stick their head above the parapet</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.000" end="01:05:39.039" style="s2">if you look at what happens to trans</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.400" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">skeptical feminists on campuses they are</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.039" end="01:05:42.319" style="s2">hounded they are harassed they are sent</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:44.160" style="s2">death threats</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.319" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">if you look at what happened to someone</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:48.319" style="s2">like mariam namazi the iranian</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:49.039" style="s2">secularist who is very critical of</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.319" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">extremist</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.039" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">islam she&#39;s often hounded on campus</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">she&#39;s told to shut the hell up</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:06:00.160" style="s2">or if you look at what happens to people</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">who who question</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:05.280" style="s2">climate change alarmism not climate</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">change but climate change alarmism they</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.280" end="01:06:08.079" style="s2">will be called deniers they will be</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:10.079" style="s2">called heretics</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.079" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">people have suggested setting up</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.079" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">international criminal tribunals because</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">they say that these people&#39;s words</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">will contribute to the warming of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">planet and the death of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:22.480" style="s2">so we live in deeply sensorious times</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:25.119" style="s2">and the reason that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.480" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">is because some of these blasphemies</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.119" end="01:06:28.799" style="s2">that people are expressing</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:29.839" style="s2">will turn out to be correct and will</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.799" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">turn out to be of</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.839" end="01:06:34.640" style="s2">enormous benefit to mankind if we allow</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">them to be expressed and if we allow</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.640" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">other people to</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">respond to them discuss them and work</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">out whether they&#39;re right or wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:45.359" style="s2">yeah you have to leave the fringe ideas</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">uh in a form they can be expressed</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.359" end="01:06:47.440" style="s2">because even though most of them are</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:49.280" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.440" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">the ones that move us forward are</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.280" end="01:06:51.599" style="s2">amongst them and this is always i mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:55.119" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:57.920" style="s2">well understood frankly but</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.119" end="01:06:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s well understood by people who are</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.920" end="01:07:03.680" style="s2">quickly losing their ability</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.680" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">to steer the ship in favor of allowing</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.680" end="01:07:07.200" style="s2">children to do it on the basis of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">tantrum that they are throwing</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.200" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">which is i must say just shocking</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:15.200" style="s2">so let me ask you a couple things we are</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:17.599" style="s2">obviously facing</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:19.680" style="s2">an election here in the us in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.599" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">context of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.680" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">most remarkable uh autoimmune reaction</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:29.039" style="s2">to reason</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:30.000" style="s2">and our election looks like i think no</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.039" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.000" end="01:07:37.039" style="s2">in history we have two</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">candidates who are feeble</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.039" end="01:07:40.319" style="s2">for different reasons i mean there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:41.599" style="s2">shared reason which has to do with age</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.319" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">and they both appear</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.599" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">to show signs of decline although biden</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">much more so than trump at this point</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:50.079" style="s2">but nonetheless it is a remarkable fact</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.079" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">not unrelated to the uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:59.440" style="s2">the tantrum being thrown in our streets</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">that the same system that delivered us</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:05.359" style="s2">a choice between two leaders who are</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:08.799" style="s2">completely unacceptable</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.359" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">um that that same system also</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.799" end="01:08:15.839" style="s2">caused an incoherent reaction</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">to what is the i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.839" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">correct understanding that the system is</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.319" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">rigged</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:26.000" style="s2">this is all one puzzle but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s going to unfold somehow and i guess</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.000" end="01:08:32.080" style="s2">the question is</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.880" end="01:08:34.159" style="s2">i&#39;m fascinated by the viewpoint of my</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.080" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">friends who don&#39;t live here</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.159" end="01:08:37.359" style="s2">who are seeing this from afar and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:39.920" style="s2">know i get</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.359" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">genuine alarm from people in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.920" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">english-speaking world</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:45.679" style="s2">outside of the u.s because there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:48.880" style="s2">i think deep understanding</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.679" end="01:08:51.520" style="s2">that the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.880" end="01:08:52.319" style="s2">even if americans lose sight of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.520" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.319" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">we&#39;re not really allowed to disassemble</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.600" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">our own society because of what it will</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">do to the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">and you know i feel this i feel that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">world has a stake in the united states</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:07.920" style="s2">remaining coherent</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:10.080" style="s2">and that in some sense um it is going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.920" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">be exposed to tremendous danger</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.080" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">as a result of our collapse if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:20.799" style="s2">how does it look to you uh from the uk</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:24.000" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t look good um</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.799" end="01:09:25.199" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s my main contribution</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.000" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">to this discussion i mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.199" end="01:09:28.640" style="s2">sometimes it looks quite shocking um</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:31.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.640" end="01:09:32.960" style="s2">it does raise questions more broadly not</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.279" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">only for the us but for other parts of</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.960" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">about what has happened to political</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.000" end="01:09:42.719" style="s2">life what has happened to public life</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:45.279" style="s2">when seemingly the two</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.719" end="01:09:46.960" style="s2">best candidates for the presidential</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.279" end="01:09:47.759" style="s2">election in the most powerful country on</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.960" end="01:09:50.960" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:52.480" style="s2">are donald trump and joe biden i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.960" end="01:09:54.320" style="s2">struck by the age</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.480" end="01:09:55.679" style="s2">thing and the decline thing i say this</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.320" end="01:10:00.080" style="s2">as someone who</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:10:01.520" style="s2">is adamantly opposed to ageism and this</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.080" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">of which i think there is a great deal</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.520" end="01:10:05.600" style="s2">at the moment the anti-boomer sentiment</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.840" end="01:10:07.600" style="s2">that exists among some of the regressive</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.600" end="01:10:09.280" style="s2">groups we&#39;ve been talking about and</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.600" end="01:10:11.920" style="s2">their tendency to understand everything</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.280" end="01:10:14.640" style="s2">as a generational warfare rather than</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.920" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">um in in any kind of more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.640" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:20.400" style="s2">um so i&#39;m against ageism however</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">if you look at someone like joe biden</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.400" end="01:10:26.239" style="s2">i&#39;m actually quite shocked at how</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:28.800" style="s2">quickly it has become a bad thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.239" end="01:10:30.800" style="s2">if you raise questions about his mental</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.800" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">faculties and people who do that will</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.800" end="01:10:35.360" style="s2">often be accused of being you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:37.040" style="s2">alt-right or engaging in right-wing</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">talking points and raising things that</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.040" end="01:10:40.400" style="s2">you should not raise and</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.800" end="01:10:42.239" style="s2">but to anyone who watches his</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.400" end="01:10:43.760" style="s2">performances it&#39;s quite obvious that</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">he&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:52.640" style="s2">20 or 30 years ago so that in itself i</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:55.360" style="s2">think is quite</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.640" end="01:10:57.360" style="s2">a good metaphor for the decay of</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.360" end="01:10:58.159" style="s2">american politics more broadly in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.360" end="01:11:01.520" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.159" end="01:11:03.199" style="s2">these two old blokes seem to be the best</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.520" end="01:11:04.080" style="s2">two options for the people to choose</p>

<p begin="01:11:04.080" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">and then you have someone like kamala</p>

<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:14.800" style="s2">actually a little bit creepy</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:16.239" style="s2">and she&#39;s people in the uk</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.800" end="01:11:18.080" style="s2">so speaking about other parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.239" end="01:11:20.880" style="s2">english speaking in the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.080" end="01:11:21.920" style="s2">i think people in the uk often find even</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:24.880" style="s2">her accent</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.920" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">quite strange um it&#39;s one of those kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.880" end="01:11:30.480" style="s2">of nasal</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">american accents which is just smacks of</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.480" end="01:11:34.320" style="s2">a certain form of privileged existence</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:35.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.320" end="01:11:37.520" style="s2">i often don&#39;t understand what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.920" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">saying i know commenting on her accent</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.520" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">is not particularly profound but i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.360" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">it is quite</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">interesting that she has this very</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">strange distinctive</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.760" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">west coast accent but what strikes me</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:50.800" style="s2">most about</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:53.280" style="s2">biden and harris the biden harris ticket</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.800" end="01:11:54.800" style="s2">is that they only seem capable of</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.280" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">defining themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.800" end="01:12:01.600" style="s2">not trump um there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:02.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not um they&#39;re not whipping up</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.600" end="01:12:05.520" style="s2">any enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.880" end="01:12:06.560" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a huge set of ideas they</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.520" end="01:12:08.560" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.560" end="01:12:12.000" style="s2">much of a program that they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.560" end="01:12:15.199" style="s2">any particularly inspiring agenda</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.000" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">but they&#39;re not trump and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.199" end="01:12:19.840" style="s2">going to backfire on them because what</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:22.080" style="s2">it will look like to many people</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.840" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">it will look like the revenge of the old</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.080" end="01:12:27.120" style="s2">establishment because</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:29.120" style="s2">even though i am a trump skeptic i</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.120" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">perfectly understand why so many people</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.120" end="01:12:33.520" style="s2">voted for him</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">um it&#39;s because they were tired of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.520" end="01:12:39.760" style="s2">old liberal technocratic establishment</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">as personified by people like hillary</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.760" end="01:12:43.120" style="s2">clinton and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">uh who obviously obviously won a</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.120" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">majority of the popular vote but people</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:49.120" style="s2">especially in more working-class areas</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.239" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.120" end="01:12:53.280" style="s2">tired of that were not interested in</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">that and they opted for the man who</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.280" end="01:12:57.040" style="s2">posed as an anti-establishment figure</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">who posed to someone who would stir up</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.040" end="01:12:59.360" style="s2">political life who posed to someone who</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.360" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">actually listen to them which</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:05.280" style="s2">politicians had not been doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:07.520" style="s2">and in fact both east coast and west</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.280" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">coast culture in recent years seems to</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.520" end="01:13:10.960" style="s2">have become</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:11.520" style="s2">singularly obsessed with mocking middle</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.960" end="01:13:13.920" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.520" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">mocking rednecks mocking people with</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.920" end="01:13:17.679" style="s2">their guns and their bibles and their</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">backward beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.679" end="01:13:24.719" style="s2">and really sneering at the average</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:25.679" style="s2">joe as you know unenlightened and stupid</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.719" end="01:13:27.679" style="s2">and backward and</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.679" end="01:13:29.760" style="s2">everything else so the vote for trump</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.679" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">made sense in that context</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.760" end="01:13:33.679" style="s2">if the democrats i know are now going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:34.800" style="s2">go into this election saying we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.679" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">trump</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.800" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to work so</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:40.480" style="s2">the choice i think it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:42.560" style="s2">it&#39;s possibly even worse than you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.480" end="01:13:45.199" style="s2">just outlined there very well</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.560" end="01:13:46.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s now an election that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.199" end="01:13:49.120" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.080" end="01:13:52.719" style="s2">and utterly revolves around</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.120" end="01:13:54.560" style="s2">trump your choice is trump or not trump</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.719" end="01:13:55.920" style="s2">your choice is not really even trump or</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.560" end="01:13:58.560" style="s2">biden because</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.920" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">who knows what biden is fundamentally or</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.560" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">what he</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:03.280" style="s2">what he represents he&#39;s quite changeable</p>

<p begin="01:14:03.280" end="01:14:06.800" style="s2">he will often ditch views if he if he</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.280" end="01:14:07.440" style="s2">thinks they&#39;re not working particularly</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.800" end="01:14:09.280" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.440" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">or if you look at the way kamala harris</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.280" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">justified</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:14.080" style="s2">the fact that she could roast biden in</p>

<p begin="01:14:14.080" end="01:14:17.760" style="s2">a few months ago and now be his running</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.080" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">partner she said well it was just a</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.760" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.480" end="01:14:22.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do in a debate you say</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.480" end="01:14:23.840" style="s2">controversial shocking things</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.320" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">in other words she didn&#39;t mean it she</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.840" end="01:14:28.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t believe it she was posing</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:30.719" style="s2">it&#39;s so incredibly shallow so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.960" end="01:14:32.640" style="s2">nothing of substance in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.719" end="01:14:35.040" style="s2">in the biden harris ticket this really</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.640" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">is a choice between trump and not trump</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.040" end="01:14:40.719" style="s2">and that is really</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:41.679" style="s2">the american people deserve so much more</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.719" end="01:14:44.719" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.679" end="01:14:46.239" style="s2">so the question of how to rejuvenate</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.719" end="01:14:48.000" style="s2">american political life</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.239" end="01:14:49.679" style="s2">i think is of huge importance to</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.000" end="01:14:52.159" style="s2">americans and the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.679" end="01:14:53.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure how that can be done</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.159" end="01:14:55.440" style="s2">other than</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.520" end="01:14:57.760" style="s2">pushing the kind of ideas that people</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.440" end="01:15:00.719" style="s2">like you have been pushing which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.760" end="01:15:02.320" style="s2">calling for a return an increased</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.719" end="01:15:05.840" style="s2">valuation of freedom</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.320" end="01:15:08.719" style="s2">and reason and equality</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.840" end="01:15:10.719" style="s2">and focus i think all those things i</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.719" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">think it&#39;s important not to see</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.719" end="01:15:13.760" style="s2">the push back against wokeness as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:15.520" style="s2">discreet</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.760" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">project i think it&#39;s actually something</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.520" end="01:15:19.920" style="s2">that can tap into</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:21.199" style="s2">and bring back to life the broader</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.920" end="01:15:23.679" style="s2">public sphere</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.199" end="01:15:24.320" style="s2">and re-engage people in a politics of</p>

<p begin="01:15:24.320" end="01:15:27.679" style="s2">and a politics of vision which at the</p>

<p begin="01:15:27.679" end="01:15:31.760" style="s2">is sorely lacking in america yeah you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:15:31.760" end="01:15:36.880" style="s2">and you know the distaste for trump is</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.800" end="01:15:38.480" style="s2">strong in many circles but the</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.880" end="01:15:41.360" style="s2">democratic party</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.480" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">has somehow created a world in which the</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.360" end="01:15:44.080" style="s2">argument to vote against trump is no</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:47.120" style="s2">longer</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:52.080" style="s2">biden&#39;s decrepitude is so severe that</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:53.760" style="s2">there is at least an argument</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.080" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t safe to have somebody in</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.760" end="01:16:00.239" style="s2">that condition in the white house</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">also there&#39;s the question of</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:21.199" style="s2">for trump because there&#39;s some hope that</p>

<p begin="01:17:52.239" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">says is empty or the fact that the</p>

<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:17:58.560" style="s2">itself has no ideas that anybody can</p>

<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">thing it is is an alternative to trump</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:10.159" style="s2">and the objection to trump is um</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">based very strongly in distaste for him</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.159" end="01:18:13.280" style="s2">there&#39;s no acknowledgement that he was</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:16.560" style="s2">portrayed</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.280" end="01:18:17.120" style="s2">as hitlerian and uh he didn&#39;t turn out</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.560" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.120" end="01:18:21.360" style="s2">hitlerian and there was no rethinking of</p>

<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">this path so</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.840" end="01:18:30.960" style="s2">frightening situation</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:33.199" style="s2">now i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re aware but i</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.960" end="01:18:36.239" style="s2">have advanced a</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.199" end="01:18:39.280" style="s2">alternative plan for our election</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.239" end="01:18:42.800" style="s2">to elect somebody different um</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.280" end="01:18:45.679" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.800" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">how difficult it is to reach americans</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.679" end="01:18:48.719" style="s2">with the very simple idea that when both</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">parties have</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.719" end="01:18:56.080" style="s2">effectively declared war on leadership</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:56.800" style="s2">and a commitment to politicizing</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.080" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.800" end="01:19:01.040" style="s2">that extends right up into the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:04.080" style="s2">willingness to destroy the nation</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.040" end="01:19:04.880" style="s2">over symbolism that we have some</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.080" end="01:19:07.360" style="s2">obligation</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.880" end="01:19:09.520" style="s2">to try something else people are so used</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.360" end="01:19:12.800" style="s2">to living in a world that is divided</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.520" end="01:19:14.560" style="s2">red and blue that they uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.800" end="01:19:16.400" style="s2">have difficulty imagining any other</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.560" end="01:19:20.719" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.400" end="01:19:23.360" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s true and um</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:25.600" style="s2">and i think trump you&#39;re right to to see</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.360" end="01:19:27.760" style="s2">that to say that trump was seen by many</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.600" end="01:19:29.760" style="s2">people as the other possibility</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.760" end="01:19:31.600" style="s2">i&#39;m sure some of them still think that</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.760" end="01:19:34.159" style="s2">because the democrats have not</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.600" end="01:19:36.320" style="s2">improved much and in some ways have got</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.159" end="01:19:38.239" style="s2">worse over the past four years</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.320" end="01:19:40.239" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure some people no longer</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.239" end="01:19:41.760" style="s2">believe that but probably still see</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.239" end="01:19:44.400" style="s2">trump as a better choice than</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.760" end="01:19:46.320" style="s2">than the democrats i think the um the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.400" end="01:19:48.000" style="s2">point you make there about the democrats</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.320" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">going down this kind of woke</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.000" end="01:19:54.320" style="s2">route that&#39;s really important because</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.920" end="01:19:55.840" style="s2">this is a common theme in in social</p>

<p begin="01:19:57.600" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">they have transformed</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.280" end="01:20:03.280" style="s2">radically over the past couple of</p>

<p begin="01:20:03.280" end="01:20:07.120" style="s2">you know they&#39;ve shifted away from their</p>

<p begin="01:22:19.760" end="01:22:24.000" style="s2">the working man the working woman and</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.560" end="01:22:25.440" style="s2">saying that they will represent their</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.000" end="01:22:27.280" style="s2">interests against the elites i think</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.440" end="01:22:29.520" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s such an interesting shift</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.280" end="01:22:30.719" style="s2">and it will be so fascinating to see how</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.520" end="01:22:33.199" style="s2">it plays out</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.719" end="01:22:34.880" style="s2">in the us this time because i think that</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.199" end="01:22:38.000" style="s2">will impact globally</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.880" end="01:22:39.760" style="s2">i thought the point you made about i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.000" end="01:22:41.600" style="s2">thought the exact same thing about the</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.760" end="01:22:42.639" style="s2">way in which trump was referred to as</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.600" end="01:22:45.280" style="s2">hitler</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.639" end="01:22:46.800" style="s2">and then there was no reckoning with the</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.280" end="01:22:48.960" style="s2">fact that that wasn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.800" end="01:22:50.880" style="s2">i actually think that&#39;s a that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.960" end="01:22:52.639" style="s2">incredibly serious matter</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.880" end="01:22:54.960" style="s2">we had the exact same thing in the uk</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.639" end="01:22:57.679" style="s2">there were protests against trump</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.960" end="01:22:59.600" style="s2">i went to them to observe them every</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.679" end="01:23:00.719" style="s2">other placard had trump with a hitler</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.600" end="01:23:02.800" style="s2">moustache</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.719" end="01:23:03.840" style="s2">telling us that the 1930s were coming</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.800" end="01:23:07.679" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:08.320" style="s2">and none of them have um apologized for</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.679" end="01:23:11.360" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.320" end="01:23:13.120" style="s2">or reassessed the situation</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.360" end="01:23:15.520" style="s2">or admitted that they were being</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.120" end="01:23:16.159" style="s2">hysterical they&#39;ve just let it slide</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.520" end="01:23:19.280" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.159" end="01:23:22.800" style="s2">history and i think that&#39;s unforgivable</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.280" end="01:23:24.719" style="s2">firstly because it describes trump in an</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.800" end="01:23:26.400" style="s2">inaccurate way he&#39;s not hitler</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.719" end="01:23:28.080" style="s2">the people who voted for him are not</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.400" end="01:23:30.080" style="s2">right-wing fascists</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.080" end="01:23:31.679" style="s2">um so they were lying about trump and</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.080" end="01:23:32.400" style="s2">they were lying about trump&#39;s support</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.679" end="01:23:35.360" style="s2">base</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.400" end="01:23:36.239" style="s2">but also it is part of this process of</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.360" end="01:23:38.560" style="s2">holocaust</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.239" end="01:23:40.239" style="s2">relativism which i think is a really</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.560" end="01:23:42.880" style="s2">worrying phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.239" end="01:23:45.199" style="s2">because the more that you compare or</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.880" end="01:23:47.440" style="s2">relatively ordinary political events</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.199" end="01:23:48.960" style="s2">in the present the more that you compare</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.440" end="01:23:51.520" style="s2">those things to what happened in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.960" end="01:23:54.719" style="s2">1930s the more you</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.520" end="01:23:57.679" style="s2">make the 1930s seem ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.719" end="01:23:58.480" style="s2">and mundane and it chips away at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.679" end="01:24:00.480" style="s2">uniqueness</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.480" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">of the holocaust and it chips away at</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.480" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">the seriousness of that moment</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:06.560" style="s2">and the fact that this was the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.760" end="01:24:09.840" style="s2">crime in human history</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.560" end="01:24:11.760" style="s2">and contributes to the broader um</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.840" end="01:24:13.840" style="s2">belief that the holocaust was not</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.760" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">particularly a big deal</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.840" end="01:24:18.480" style="s2">the nazis were bad people in the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:21.520" style="s2">way that trump is a bad person</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.480" end="01:24:23.679" style="s2">um and that again is another example of</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.520" end="01:24:24.560" style="s2">just historical ignorance and historical</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.679" end="01:24:27.280" style="s2">illiteracy</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.560" end="01:24:28.159" style="s2">and and the terrible consequences that</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.280" end="01:24:29.920" style="s2">can have</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.159" end="01:24:31.520" style="s2">for people&#39;s understanding of the past</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.920" end="01:24:33.440" style="s2">and for their understanding of what</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.520" end="01:24:34.960" style="s2">certain groups of people experienced in</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.440" end="01:24:38.080" style="s2">the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.960" end="01:24:40.080" style="s2">i think um your idea of um</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.080" end="01:24:41.760" style="s2">creating the possibility of another</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.080" end="01:24:45.199" style="s2">candidate someone who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.760" end="01:24:47.360" style="s2">trump and who&#39;s not not trump which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.199" end="01:24:49.440" style="s2">what biden and harris are</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.360" end="01:24:51.120" style="s2">i think that&#39;s really interesting and my</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.440" end="01:24:54.320" style="s2">view of political life at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.120" end="01:24:56.719" style="s2">is anything that can be done to</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.320" end="01:24:58.159" style="s2">open the door to a new possibility is</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.719" end="01:25:01.760" style="s2">worth pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.159" end="01:25:03.600" style="s2">um this is why i&#39;m quite interested in</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.760" end="01:25:05.280" style="s2">the rise of populist parties</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.600" end="01:25:07.040" style="s2">in europe now some of these populist</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.280" end="01:25:09.920" style="s2">parties are bad they have</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.040" end="01:25:12.400" style="s2">awful beliefs some are good some are far</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.920" end="01:25:13.920" style="s2">right some are far left</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.400" end="01:25:15.760" style="s2">you know there are all sorts of parties</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.920" end="01:25:17.920" style="s2">but what i think is fascinating and</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.760" end="01:25:18.719" style="s2">important and quite encouraging about</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.920" end="01:25:20.480" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.719" end="01:25:22.159" style="s2">is that they are trying to create</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.480" end="01:25:24.800" style="s2">another possibility</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.159" end="01:25:25.520" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t the conservative</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.800" end="01:25:27.280" style="s2">right right-wing</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:29.360" style="s2">section of society and something which</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.280" end="01:25:31.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t the kind of collapsing social</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.360" end="01:25:32.239" style="s2">democratic wing of society and that</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.040" end="01:25:33.679" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to open the door to</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.239" end="01:25:36.800" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.679" end="01:25:39.600" style="s2">all forms of political experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.800" end="01:25:42.000" style="s2">if they are driven by a desire to</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.600" end="01:25:45.199" style="s2">democratize public life and to re</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.000" end="01:25:48.239" style="s2">to reintroduce reason and</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.199" end="01:25:49.840" style="s2">freedom and equality to the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.239" end="01:25:51.280" style="s2">public debate</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.840" end="01:25:54.000" style="s2">anything that does that i think should</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.280" end="01:25:57.040" style="s2">be welcomed and encouraged</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.000" end="01:25:59.280" style="s2">yeah i i agree it must be and</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.040" end="01:26:00.159" style="s2">the basis for it being incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.280" end="01:26:03.440" style="s2">vibrant is</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.159" end="01:26:06.400" style="s2">there but it is going to be shouted out</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.440" end="01:26:10.080" style="s2">of existence before it gets a chance</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.400" end="01:26:13.360" style="s2">to uh to actually flourish</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.080" end="01:26:16.960" style="s2">now i i agree with your analysis about</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.360" end="01:26:17.360" style="s2">the 1930s and the the real hidden danger</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.960" end="01:26:21.040" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.360" end="01:26:22.880" style="s2">is that we have robbed the very special</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.040" end="01:26:25.920" style="s2">and important claim that something</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.880" end="01:26:26.880" style="s2">is hitlerian of all meaning so that as</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.920" end="01:26:29.520" style="s2">it returns</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.880" end="01:26:30.480" style="s2">we can no longer invoke it and have it</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.520" end="01:26:33.440" style="s2">resonate</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.480" end="01:26:34.080" style="s2">and i i must say i feel this you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.440" end="01:26:37.040" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.080" end="01:26:38.000" style="s2">as you know an analytically focused</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.040" end="01:26:39.840" style="s2">person who</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.000" end="01:26:41.040" style="s2">recognizes that that must be the case</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.840" end="01:26:43.679" style="s2">but also as a jew</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.040" end="01:26:44.960" style="s2">who knows that you know i&#39;m beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.679" end="01:26:48.000" style="s2">hear a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.960" end="01:26:51.199" style="s2">um commonplace anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.000" end="01:26:54.400" style="s2">in this woke ideology that</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.199" end="01:26:56.480" style="s2">is so familiar from what i read about</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.400" end="01:26:59.760" style="s2">and heard about as a young person</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.480" end="01:27:01.440" style="s2">that i know the danger isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.760" end="01:27:03.280" style="s2">where we were told it is and it is</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.440" end="01:27:06.400" style="s2">exactly in</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.280" end="01:27:07.600" style="s2">the hands of those who are shouting nazi</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.400" end="01:27:11.520" style="s2">this nazi that</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.600" end="01:27:14.800" style="s2">which um you know i guess uh</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.520" end="01:27:16.400" style="s2">maybe it doesn&#39;t rank given the level of</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.800" end="01:27:17.920" style="s2">irony that seems to be attained on a</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.400" end="01:27:19.040" style="s2">regular basis these days but it</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.920" end="01:27:21.600" style="s2">certainly would be up there under</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.040" end="01:27:25.840" style="s2">ordinary circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.600" end="01:27:28.719" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know suppose</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.840" end="01:27:31.120" style="s2">the u.s does come apart what happens in</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.719" end="01:27:31.120" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.440" end="01:27:36.000" style="s2">well that that&#39;s a good question uh i i</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.719" end="01:27:37.600" style="s2">think the question is what happens in</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.000" end="01:27:40.159" style="s2">the world i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.600" end="01:27:40.880" style="s2">you know the ripple effect would be</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.159" end="01:27:43.920" style="s2">enormous</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.880" end="01:27:45.600" style="s2">i think i mean my view is</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.920" end="01:27:47.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t think america will come apart</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.600" end="01:27:50.320" style="s2">but at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.040" end="01:27:52.400" style="s2">i am genuinely shocked at how divided</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.320" end="01:27:53.360" style="s2">america is i mean we really are going</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.400" end="01:27:55.520" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.360" end="01:27:56.480" style="s2">i mean people compare it to 1968 when</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.520" end="01:27:59.199" style="s2">there was lots of</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.480" end="01:28:00.639" style="s2">street disturbances and an election and</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.199" end="01:28:01.840" style="s2">all sorts of things were going on at the</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.639" end="01:28:04.639" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.840" end="01:28:05.639" style="s2">i think it is like that but in but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.639" end="01:28:09.679" style="s2">even more in</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.639" end="01:28:11.440" style="s2">incoherent um because at least in 68</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.679" end="01:28:12.800" style="s2">you knew what people were doing right</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.440" end="01:28:14.320" style="s2">you could agree with them or disagree</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.800" end="01:28:15.199" style="s2">with them but you knew why people were</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.320" end="01:28:17.199" style="s2">on the streets</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.199" end="01:28:19.120" style="s2">um you knew what they were protesting</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.199" end="01:28:21.360" style="s2">about some of them were good protests</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.120" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">some of them were bad protests but</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.360" end="01:28:25.360" style="s2">it all fitted within a broader framework</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.000" end="01:28:27.360" style="s2">of political life</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.360" end="01:28:29.520" style="s2">and the question of how to pursue</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.360" end="01:28:31.280" style="s2">certain interests and what would</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.520" end="01:28:32.639" style="s2">what was the best method for doing that</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.280" end="01:28:34.480" style="s2">it made sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.639" end="01:28:35.920" style="s2">you people could make sense of it even</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.480" end="01:28:37.520" style="s2">if they no doubt found it quite</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.920" end="01:28:39.920" style="s2">disorientating</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.520" end="01:28:41.520" style="s2">i think at the moment the framework is</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.920" end="01:28:44.000" style="s2">missing and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.520" end="01:28:45.440" style="s2">there&#39;s such an a sense of incoherence</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.000" end="01:28:48.560" style="s2">and a lot of the protests</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.440" end="01:28:52.480" style="s2">are nihilistic um</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.560" end="01:28:54.239" style="s2">they are targeted at abstract symbols or</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.480" end="01:28:56.080" style="s2">symbols of america more broadly you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.239" end="01:28:58.560" style="s2">the footage of people tearing down</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.080" end="01:29:01.040" style="s2">statues of columbus for example</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.560" end="01:29:03.360" style="s2">and stamping on his head and rolling him</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.040" end="01:29:04.960" style="s2">into a river or whatever else</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.360" end="01:29:06.400" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that that&#39;s a terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.960" end="01:29:10.080" style="s2">image because</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.400" end="01:29:12.560" style="s2">this is it&#39;s like philip roth&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.080" end="01:29:14.000" style="s2">american pastoral you know it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.560" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">the upper middle classes have gone</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.000" end="01:29:17.600" style="s2">insane</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.880" end="01:29:18.159" style="s2">and there&#39;s very little sense to this</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.600" end="01:29:21.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.159" end="01:29:22.960" style="s2">i think what&#39;s most interesting about it</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.520" end="01:29:24.239" style="s2">quite a few writers have made this</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.960" end="01:29:26.560" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.239" end="01:29:27.440" style="s2">which is that this is not a radical</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.560" end="01:29:29.840" style="s2">protest</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.440" end="01:29:31.760" style="s2">this is almost the revenge of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.840" end="01:29:33.360" style="s2">bourgeoisie this is the sons and</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.760" end="01:29:36.159" style="s2">daughters of privilege</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.360" end="01:29:37.760" style="s2">who are horrified by the way in which</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.159" end="01:29:38.159" style="s2">politics has gone particularly over the</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.760" end="01:29:41.199" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.159" end="01:29:41.840" style="s2">four years and are taking their revenge</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.199" end="01:29:44.000" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.840" end="01:29:46.000" style="s2">raging against america raging against</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.000" end="01:29:48.320" style="s2">ordinary people raging against</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.000" end="01:29:50.000" style="s2">things they don&#39;t like so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.320" end="01:29:51.280" style="s2">strange it&#39;s very incoherent it&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="01:29:51.280" end="01:29:57.280" style="s2">so i think um i think america will</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.280" end="01:29:59.280" style="s2">just about manage to hold it together</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.280" end="01:30:00.239" style="s2">but what i think is really clear about</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.280" end="01:30:03.280" style="s2">this election</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.239" end="01:30:06.800" style="s2">is that whatever happens it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.280" end="01:30:09.840" style="s2">stop these problems because neither</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.800" end="01:30:12.719" style="s2">ticket has the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.840" end="01:30:13.520" style="s2">to quell this descent or to give</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.719" end="01:30:15.360" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.520" end="01:30:18.159" style="s2">a sense of vision or a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.360" end="01:30:20.159" style="s2">connectivity or a sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.159" end="01:30:22.560" style="s2">trump said he would but he&#39;s failed in</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.159" end="01:30:24.000" style="s2">numerous ways and he hasn&#39;t lived up to</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.560" end="01:30:25.760" style="s2">the promises he made to</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.000" end="01:30:27.199" style="s2">middle america and to working-class</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.760" end="01:30:29.199" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.199" end="01:30:31.679" style="s2">byrden and harris i think are only</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.199" end="01:30:33.520" style="s2">interested in appealing to a particular</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.679" end="01:30:34.000" style="s2">section of society and promoting a</p>

<p begin="01:30:36.639" end="01:30:39.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.120" end="01:30:40.800" style="s2">you were right earlier to raise the</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.040" end="01:30:41.920" style="s2">interplay between the democratic</p>

<p begin="01:30:41.920" end="01:30:45.840" style="s2">and the and the disturbances on the</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.840" end="01:30:47.920" style="s2">streets and i think the democrats are</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.840" end="01:30:48.480" style="s2">playing with fire in relation to that if</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.920" end="01:30:51.600" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.480" end="01:30:53.520" style="s2">think that by implicitly encouraging</p>

<p begin="01:30:54.560" end="01:30:57.840" style="s2">i think they&#39;re probably in for a rude</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.159" end="01:31:02.239" style="s2">awakening um</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.840" end="01:31:05.280" style="s2">but neither camp will be capable of</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.239" end="01:31:06.320" style="s2">weaving a new purposeful narrative for</p>

<p begin="01:31:06.320" end="01:31:10.880" style="s2">so i think that task is ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.440" end="01:31:11.600" style="s2">regardless of what happens in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.880" end="01:31:15.360" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.600" end="01:31:18.480" style="s2">in a few months time that cannot</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.360" end="01:31:21.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.480" end="01:31:22.480" style="s2">overstate the importance of carrying on</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.520" end="01:31:25.600" style="s2">that discussion</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.480" end="01:31:28.560" style="s2">about what america is for</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.600" end="01:31:30.639" style="s2">what the west is for what values are</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.560" end="01:31:32.880" style="s2">important what values we have to rescue</p>

<p begin="01:31:34.560" end="01:31:39.360" style="s2">that discussion is so crucial to the</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.679" end="01:31:41.120" style="s2">broader discussion</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.360" end="01:31:43.440" style="s2">of how to improve political life and in</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.120" end="01:31:45.199" style="s2">some ways it&#39;s prior to that</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.440" end="01:31:46.719" style="s2">i think it&#39;s the kind of work that</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.199" end="01:31:48.239" style="s2">people like you and others are doing i</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.719" end="01:31:49.360" style="s2">think is actually prior to the</p>

<p begin="01:31:49.360" end="01:31:54.719" style="s2">rejuvenation of public life because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.560" end="01:31:57.520" style="s2">only by defending those foundational</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.719" end="01:31:59.600" style="s2">principles and those foundational values</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.520" end="01:32:02.560" style="s2">and the idea that america is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.600" end="01:32:04.960" style="s2">good experimental republic which has</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.560" end="01:32:07.679" style="s2">done a lot of good stuff for people</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.960" end="01:32:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s only by defending those values that</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.679" end="01:32:09.760" style="s2">we then might get to a position where we</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.440" end="01:32:11.760" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.760" end="01:32:14.239" style="s2">inject public life more broadly with a</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.760" end="01:32:16.320" style="s2">sense of purpose so</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.239" end="01:32:17.280" style="s2">i see i think two things are going on at</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.320" end="01:32:19.199" style="s2">the moment you have</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.280" end="01:32:21.040" style="s2">mainstream political life which is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.199" end="01:32:23.600" style="s2">complete mess</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.040" end="01:32:24.639" style="s2">and there&#39;s no inspiring figures at all</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.600" end="01:32:26.800" style="s2">and then you have this</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.639" end="01:32:29.120" style="s2">other battle these culture wars this</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.800" end="01:32:32.159" style="s2">clash between</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.120" end="01:32:35.679" style="s2">regressive regressive</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.159" end="01:32:37.440" style="s2">supposed lefties and ordinary people who</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.679" end="01:32:40.320" style="s2">are probably very skeptical of</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.440" end="01:32:41.120" style="s2">their aggressive leftism and i think at</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.320" end="01:32:43.440" style="s2">some point</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.120" end="01:32:45.120" style="s2">those two different strands of american</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.440" end="01:32:46.320" style="s2">life will come together</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.120" end="01:32:48.320" style="s2">but whether that will happen in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.320" end="01:32:50.080" style="s2">election or after it i think remains to</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.320" end="01:32:51.840" style="s2">be seen</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.080" end="01:32:54.080" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s a very good question</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.840" end="01:32:57.280" style="s2">and if it um</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.080" end="01:32:58.880" style="s2">plays out as you say i only see these</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.280" end="01:33:01.199" style="s2">patterns getting worse</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.880" end="01:33:03.280" style="s2">over the course of the next four years</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.199" end="01:33:04.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s a question about how long we</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.280" end="01:33:05.440" style="s2">can hold out</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.080" end="01:33:10.080" style="s2">as they do get worse because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.440" end="01:33:10.080" style="s2">gotten bad at an incredible rate</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.159" end="01:33:15.120" style="s2">all right well brendan this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.199" end="01:33:17.040" style="s2">as always been a fascinating discussion</p>
