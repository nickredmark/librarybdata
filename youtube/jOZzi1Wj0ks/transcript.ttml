<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">yeah great to have you on the really</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">interesting background mark started out</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:47.930" style="s2">as a theoretical physicist and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">became a technologist</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.930" end="00:00:51.510" style="s2">scientist and other fields and an</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:54.420" style="s2">adviser to public and private</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">organizations globally his perhaps best</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.420" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">known as the author of cfengine</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">the first industrial grade configuration</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">management systems for large computing</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:06.119" style="s2">installations still used by some big</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">companies he&#39;s also what I might call a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">practical philosopher I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.040" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">he&#39;d like that term or not we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">out with his development of promise</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">theory which we&#39;ll discuss here today</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">and yeah he writes music composes</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:23.009" style="s2">fiction and thinks about money</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">whoa so let&#39;s start out just a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.009" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">bit on your background what caused you</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:29.939" style="s2">to bail from physics money your soda hey</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about money I finished my</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.939" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">PhD I went to Norway of all places too</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">many to go skiing I I should tell you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">but skiing and mountaineering but there</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">was a postdoc in physics in that and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">had a couple of years worth of postdoc</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">money from the Royal Society which ran</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">out sometime in the mid 90s and then it</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:54.090" style="s2">was a kind of a low point in in research</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:57.060" style="s2">funding so I had to find other sources</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.090" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">of income and after waiting on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.060" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">corner with my cup for a while nobody</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">gave me any money so I I decided to move</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">into my hobby at the time which should</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">sort of become computer science at that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">point that&#39;s great you know I&#39;m involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">with the Santa Fe Institute and have</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">been for many years and SFI we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:19.470" style="s2">lots of physicists turned I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">call them imperialistic invaders of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.470" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">other fields and they do great what do</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:25.490" style="s2">you think makes physicists such good</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:27.990" style="s2">generalists</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.490" end="00:02:31.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question I&#39;m young I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.990" end="00:02:32.819" style="s2">think it&#39;s the you know the tool set</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.050" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">that we have in physics is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:39.000" style="s2">tool set going back I mean all the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">to Euclid I suppose and Pythagoras even</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.000" end="00:02:43.800" style="s2">for that matter just the way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">at the world and trying to quantify it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.800" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">and at the same time having both</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:50.070" style="s2">quantitative and qualitative ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">it and being able to put these into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.070" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">story and tell that story in different</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:58.880" style="s2">ways I think that&#39;s a general skill</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:02.850" style="s2">which perhaps other areas of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.880" end="00:03:04.440" style="s2">have not been able to practice in with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">so many deep thinkers throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.440" end="00:03:07.019" style="s2">years who&#39;ve taught us great ways to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.019" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">so I&#39;d like to think that some</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">physicists are just great storytellers</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re able to apply their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">to stuff that happens you know it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.440" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">definition physics is the study of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:23.549" style="s2">that happens yeah that&#39;s the you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">the concept of the physical right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.549" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">something that really happens so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">something I&#39;ve noticed when I went out</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:31.560" style="s2">to Asif I as a junior researcher after I</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:34.079" style="s2">retired from business as I found that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.560" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">physicists above everybody else are able</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.079" end="00:03:38.340" style="s2">to think in terms of the simple and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:41.250" style="s2">know one of the things I took away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.340" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">my time at SFI is that complexity really</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.250" end="00:03:46.260" style="s2">arises from simplicity and in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:48.630" style="s2">fields people tend to jump in at too</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:50.730" style="s2">high a level of complexity and not start</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.630" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">with the simple does that make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.730" end="00:03:54.450" style="s2">to you yeah absolutely I couldn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:55.829" style="s2">with you more and you know fine Richard</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.450" end="00:03:58.470" style="s2">Feynman had a famous rant about</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.829" end="00:03:59.880" style="s2">philosophers I&#39;m not gonna repeat that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.470" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">although I agree with a little bit of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.880" end="00:04:05.940" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not his anti philosopher as</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">as he was but when I read philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.940" end="00:04:10.500" style="s2">I do read quite a bit of philosophy when</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:12.180" style="s2">I can what I find is that they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.500" end="00:04:15.209" style="s2">throw everything up in the air and try</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">to catch everything whereas a physicist</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.209" end="00:04:20.039" style="s2">will throw some stuff up in the air and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">try to see the essential pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.039" end="00:04:24.659" style="s2">then just throw everything else away and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">just look at that and then focus in on</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.659" end="00:04:28.290" style="s2">it narrow in on it you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.290" end="00:04:31.920" style="s2">eliminate approximate approximate</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">approximate and just keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.920" end="00:04:38.040" style="s2">until some some simple essence remains</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s boiled down to a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.040" end="00:04:43.320" style="s2">diamond and then go back up right</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:47.130" style="s2">particularly the imperialists who invade</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:49.020" style="s2">biology or anthropology they say alright</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.130" end="00:04:50.460" style="s2">let&#39;s make sure we start with the simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.020" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">and then from the simple we can grow</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.460" end="00:04:55.200" style="s2">upward well enough on that let&#39;s jump in</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">to the substance here let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.200" end="00:04:58.200" style="s2">cfengine</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:00.330" style="s2">as i understand it it was a precursor to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.200" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">today&#39;s configuration management systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.330" end="00:05:06.450" style="s2">like puppet and chef and even can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.090" end="00:05:08.490" style="s2">considered an ancestor to kubernetes or</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.450" end="00:05:11.460" style="s2">however the hell you pronounce that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.490" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">what insights led you to create cfengine</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.460" end="00:05:16.920" style="s2">that way yeah that&#39;s another story which</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:20.490" style="s2">came about from my dilly-dallying around</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.920" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">physics which was when I went to when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.490" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2">came to Oslo for my skiing a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:27.960" style="s2">mountaineering in physics I got involved</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:31.800" style="s2">with installing the computers as as boom</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.960" end="00:05:33.270" style="s2">does and for a while it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.800" end="00:05:34.950" style="s2">to me to learn everything that I could</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.270" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">about these machines and make them work</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.950" end="00:05:41.700" style="s2">and automate them and observe how these</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:45.320" style="s2">processes talk to one another across the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.700" end="00:05:47.580" style="s2">network it was all fascinating to me and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.320" end="00:05:48.990" style="s2">that was fun doing everything by hand</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.580" end="00:05:52.610" style="s2">for a while to learn I like to get my</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.990" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">hands dirty when I learn a new field but</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.610" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">after a couple of months then suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so fun anymore to be doing this</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:01.770" style="s2">having people knocking at the door in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.540" style="s2">office and say mark could you could you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.770" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">just do this for me then could you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.540" end="00:06:08.420" style="s2">do that for me and could you fix my</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:11.790" style="s2">computer you know it goes so um I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.420" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">thought being you know an ardent fan of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.790" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">science fiction and technology wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:19.770" style="s2">it be cool if I could actually write a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:21.480" style="s2">kind of an AI system that could manage</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.770" end="00:06:23.700" style="s2">the thing for me or get the computers to</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.229" end="00:06:59.000" style="s2">right so I I sat down and tried to write</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.000" end="00:07:03.500" style="s2">of those little languages and and the</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.699" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">early on making script based automation</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.419" end="00:07:15.830" style="s2">in UNIX I looked at their stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:17.690" style="s2">thought this is cool but what we really</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.830" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">need is a much simpler way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.690" end="00:07:23.180" style="s2">that simplicity again and the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:26.419" style="s2">observed was that when they wrote</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.419" end="00:07:33.110" style="s2">had all of these if-then-else statements</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.490" end="00:07:57.349" style="s2">variations of this that it became a</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.940" end="00:08:21.770" style="s2">things are going on how shall I adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.370" end="00:08:24.409" style="s2">this situation and then you should be</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.770" end="00:08:27.770" style="s2">able to specify as a kind of a policy in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.409" end="00:08:29.479" style="s2">a high-level declarative way what you</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.620" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">on and so on and then just simply make</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:48.170" style="s2">turn that into the desired end state of</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.330" end="00:09:04.330" style="s2">that&#39;s how it got me started on cfengine</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.310" end="00:09:07.530" style="s2">I wanted to make that super cool AI</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.330" end="00:09:10.930" style="s2">based reasoning system that could</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:19.540" style="s2">and changing them and manipulating them</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.710" end="00:09:21.070" style="s2">you&#39;ve also mentioned in the context to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.540" end="00:09:23.800" style="s2">cfengine something called the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.070" end="00:09:26.260" style="s2">maintenance theorem theory that looks to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.800" end="00:09:28.120" style="s2">me like policing and equilibrium by</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.350" end="00:09:35.710" style="s2">and how it relates the cfengine yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.500" end="00:09:38.710" style="s2">I&#39;m because being of a physics</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.950" end="00:09:54.340" style="s2">actually what to even looked a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.330" end="00:09:58.870" style="s2">bit of complexity theory in the 80s when</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.340" end="00:10:01.900" style="s2">that was becoming a thing but because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.870" end="00:10:06.690" style="s2">wanted to look at the world in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.900" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">these nice descriptions of of all things</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.690" end="00:10:12.180" style="s2">communicating and interacting I looked</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:14.620" style="s2">at the computer on my desk and said</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.180" end="00:10:16.420" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t I be able to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.620" end="00:10:19.390" style="s2">computer not as a machine but as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.420" end="00:10:22.420" style="s2">phenomenon and the standard story in</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.390" end="00:10:24.400" style="s2">computer science these kind of computers</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.420" end="00:10:25.900" style="s2">do what we tell them when we program</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:33.300" style="s2">with computers ever notice that that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.220" end="00:10:35.830" style="s2">an extremely optimistic idealized idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.300" end="00:10:39.160" style="s2">about what computers might do on a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.830" end="00:10:40.420" style="s2">day but I figured well we ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.160" end="00:10:43.540" style="s2">able to look at these things as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.420" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">phenomenon that are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.540" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">unpredictable now because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.460" style="s2">connected them to a network it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:50.290" style="s2">longer just what we program them to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.460" end="00:10:52.570" style="s2">but it&#39;s what other people elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.290" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">program the neighboring computer to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.570" end="00:10:57.790" style="s2">and what it&#39;s doing to our computer and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:11:01.510" style="s2">how they&#39;re sharing resources and so on</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.790" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">and so on so there&#39;s a computer program</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.510" end="00:11:06.730" style="s2">any kind of process is actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:09.399" style="s2">place in a highly complex environment</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.740" end="00:11:21.190" style="s2">program we can come back to this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.970" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">really interesting measurements that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.190" end="00:11:28.990" style="s2">did around this and that means that all</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.990" end="00:11:33.940" style="s2">laid plans of mice and men of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.350" end="00:12:07.510" style="s2">so I took this idea of the intended</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.260" end="00:12:10.120" style="s2">state of the computer what&#39;s intended by</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.510" end="00:12:13.089" style="s2">the system and this this idea of intent</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.120" end="00:12:16.500" style="s2">comes back many times as a theme and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.089" end="00:12:19.029" style="s2">wanted to create a system which could</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.500" end="00:12:21.699" style="s2">every time it went out of whack I whack</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.029" end="00:12:24.610" style="s2">it back in like whack-a-mole this in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.699" end="00:12:26.290" style="s2">kind of detailed balance and out of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.610" end="00:12:29.940" style="s2">I came up with this this theorem which</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.290" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">is essentially a rebranding of Shannon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.940" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">error correction theorem which says that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:38.500" style="s2">you can set aside a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:40.930" style="s2">resources in your system to correct</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.500" end="00:12:42.910" style="s2">errors assuming that you know what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.930" end="00:12:44.769" style="s2">correct state of the system is you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.910" end="00:12:48.010" style="s2">correct those errors to that proper</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.769" end="00:12:51.220" style="s2">state simply by reiterating the desired</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.010" end="00:12:53.170" style="s2">policy again and again and then I sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.220" end="00:12:56.470" style="s2">of reformulated that in symbolic terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.170" end="00:12:58.540" style="s2">for a dynamical system and the computer</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.470" end="00:13:01.690" style="s2">is a dynamical system with symbols as</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:03.160" style="s2">well so and that turned into this thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.690" end="00:13:06.100" style="s2">which I called the maintenance theorem</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:09.250" style="s2">which is as you exactly say is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.100" end="00:13:11.709" style="s2">policing of the desired state as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.250" end="00:13:14.230" style="s2">defined it your policy for the system</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.709" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">and it works in a dynamical way as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.230" end="00:13:19.449" style="s2">detail balance that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:20.570" style="s2">in 1998 you wrote a paper called</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.620" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">computing homeostasis is something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.530" end="00:13:32.900" style="s2">I find very central to how I think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">the world could you say more about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.900" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">perspective and how has it age you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:39.950" style="s2">that&#39;s that was a really funny story</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:42.620" style="s2">because it was a very first time I went</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.950" end="00:13:45.020" style="s2">to the United States in fact was in 1997</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.620" end="00:13:47.450" style="s2">I went to a conference and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.020" end="00:13:49.010" style="s2">about cfengine I presented my burgeoning</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.450" end="00:13:52.460" style="s2">tool cfengine</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.010" end="00:13:54.200" style="s2">was from 1993 and it developed as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.460" end="00:13:56.660" style="s2">open source project for a few years and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.200" end="00:13:58.850" style="s2">then I was invited to the Lisa</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.660" end="00:14:02.150" style="s2">conference which is a beautiful sunny</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.850" end="00:14:06.260" style="s2">San Diego and I I gave a talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.150" end="00:14:08.900" style="s2">detailed balanced idea and it was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.260" end="00:14:11.510" style="s2">conference lots of people and and after</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.900" end="00:14:13.220" style="s2">my talk bunch of guys came up to me and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.510" end="00:14:16.760" style="s2">they said ah this is very interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.220" end="00:14:19.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like so what is this it&#39;s like a an</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.760" end="00:14:23.710" style="s2">advanced form of Chrome Quran is a</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.710" end="00:14:29.690" style="s2">and I I went back very dejected and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.230" end="00:14:32.050" style="s2">thought they didn&#39;t understand a word of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.690" end="00:14:35.060" style="s2">what I was saying so I spent that year</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.050" end="00:14:37.880" style="s2">actually trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.060" end="00:14:39.530" style="s2">explain this idea of detail balance and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.880" end="00:14:42.170" style="s2">maintenance in systems automated</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.530" end="00:14:45.380" style="s2">maintenance and on the plane going home</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.170" end="00:14:46.940" style="s2">this is a true story going home on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.380" end="00:14:48.860" style="s2">plane I actually got sick I came down</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.940" end="00:14:51.110" style="s2">with some flu on the plane or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:54.350" style="s2">and I came up with this idea if the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.110" end="00:14:57.770" style="s2">immune system as an analogy of this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.350" end="00:15:00.230" style="s2">of detailed balance where your body in</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.770" end="00:15:03.350" style="s2">some sense has a policy for it is an a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.230" end="00:15:06.230" style="s2">healthy ideal state and what it goes out</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.350" end="00:15:08.270" style="s2">of that balance some monitoring system</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.230" end="00:15:11.050" style="s2">picks up on that and then tries to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.270" end="00:15:14.360" style="s2">restore it to that state by eliminating</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.050" end="00:15:16.540" style="s2">invading pathogens and whatnot not only</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.360" end="00:15:18.860" style="s2">invading pathogens of course but</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.540" end="00:15:21.290" style="s2">regulating the heartbeat and the blood</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.860" end="00:15:23.840" style="s2">supply and oxygen levels and all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.290" end="00:15:27.230" style="s2">these kinds of temperature things and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.840" end="00:15:31.310" style="s2">whatnot so this idea of regulation both</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.230" end="00:15:34.850" style="s2">dynamically in terms of rates and</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:37.640" style="s2">and temperatures and so on but also</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.850" end="00:15:39.860" style="s2">symbolically in terms of are you an</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.640" end="00:15:43.610" style="s2">allowed pattern of DNA or are you an</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.860" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">allowed antigen in my system this was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.610" end="00:15:49.130" style="s2">very interesting idea to me and I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:52.550" style="s2">to use that as an analogy to explain my</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.130" end="00:15:54.950" style="s2">idea and at that time there was I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.550" end="00:15:57.080" style="s2">know if you know but there was a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.950" end="00:15:59.690" style="s2">interesting lady called Polly Metzinger</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.080" end="00:16:03.230" style="s2">who came up with a theory of immunology</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.690" end="00:16:05.330" style="s2">called the danger theory which was kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.230" end="00:16:09.020" style="s2">of a counterpoint to this idea of self</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.330" end="00:16:12.410" style="s2">non-self in the immune system and her</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.020" end="00:16:14.540" style="s2">idea was that self non-self distinction</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.410" end="00:16:16.850" style="s2">is quite a hard computational problem it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.540" end="00:16:21.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.850" end="00:16:24.620" style="s2">evolution but if you could detect danger</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.800" end="00:16:27.650" style="s2">signals that&#39;s much easier thing to to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.620" end="00:16:30.620" style="s2">detect because in the body when when</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.650" end="00:16:34.279" style="s2">cells die badly because of attack they</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.620" end="00:16:35.930" style="s2">tend to die by necrosis they you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.279" end="00:16:38.120" style="s2">they burst apart and they leak all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.930" end="00:16:40.250" style="s2">their innards and some horrible mass</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.120" end="00:16:41.630" style="s2">inside and those those bits of protein</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.250" end="00:16:43.540" style="s2">are easy to pick up on that&#39;s what your</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.630" end="00:16:47.330" style="s2">immune system picks up on</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.540" end="00:16:49.220" style="s2">whereas if cells die properly by</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.330" end="00:16:51.110" style="s2">programmed cell death when they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.220" end="00:16:52.610" style="s2">shutting down your your computer</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.110" end="00:16:55.160" style="s2">programs just shutting down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.610" end="00:16:57.380" style="s2">finished its job and so on then they die</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.160" end="00:17:00.200" style="s2">they die by this program cell death ins</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.380" end="00:17:02.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s a clean business so there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.200" end="00:17:05.780" style="s2">a simple computational algorithm if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.390" end="00:17:09.260" style="s2">will for detecting bad circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.780" end="00:17:12.610" style="s2">over good circumstances and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.260" end="00:17:16.579" style="s2">try to apply this idea to my cfengine I</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.610" end="00:17:18.980" style="s2">already had the symbolic part but then I</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.579" end="00:17:21.589" style="s2">realized I could add the dynamical part</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.980" end="00:17:23.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s what got me into machine</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.589" end="00:17:27.319" style="s2">learning and threshold detection</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.630" end="00:17:29.000" style="s2">adaptive systems and so on so I went and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.319" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">I held I gave this paper called computer</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.000" end="00:17:33.050" style="s2">immunology and the guy came up to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:36.790" style="s2">afterwards and he said oh do you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.050" end="00:17:39.290" style="s2">this group at the Santa Fe Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.790" end="00:17:41.570" style="s2">University of New Mexico Stephanie</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.290" end="00:17:44.720" style="s2">forest group who have been working on</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.570" end="00:17:46.220" style="s2">computer immune systems for security</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">and I hadn&#39;t heard of them buddy but</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.220" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">times are we got to know each other a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:52.280" style="s2">little bit and exchange some papers some</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:53.450" style="s2">that was a fun thing I was gonna point</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.280" end="00:17:55.940" style="s2">out if you hadn&#39;t made the connection</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.450" end="00:17:58.309" style="s2">that Stephanie Forest has been working</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.940" end="00:17:59.780" style="s2">in this area for a long time and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.309" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">she&#39;s certainly somebody who&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.780" end="00:18:04.340" style="s2">looking at their work alright so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.150" end="00:18:06.470" style="s2">go from kind of the theory idea to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.340" end="00:18:07.970" style="s2">little bit more practical what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.470" end="00:18:09.940" style="s2">view the current state of play of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.970" end="00:18:12.020" style="s2">configuration management you know I see</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.940" end="00:18:13.700" style="s2">kubernetes sort of a hell you call it</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.020" end="00:18:17.059" style="s2">how do you pronounce that by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.700" end="00:18:19.010" style="s2">say kubernetes and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.059" end="00:18:22.940" style="s2">Greek word it means the steering of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.010" end="00:18:23.240" style="s2">steersman the rota system ok that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.940" end="00:18:25.370" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.240" end="00:18:27.110" style="s2">anyway I see kubernetes everywhere I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.370" end="00:18:29.000" style="s2">think the last time I personally fooled</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.110" end="00:18:32.750" style="s2">with any of this we use chef&#39;s back in</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.000" end="00:18:34.850" style="s2">2013 you know as a guy who&#39;s had his you</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.750" end="00:18:36.860" style="s2">know foot in this category for a long</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.850" end="00:18:39.530" style="s2">time what&#39;s your thought of the state of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.860" end="00:18:41.330" style="s2">play of configuration management great</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.530" end="00:18:43.010" style="s2">questions ask me bit controversial as</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.330" end="00:18:45.700" style="s2">well because this I think people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.010" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">understanding this has changed over time</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.700" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">it you gotta understand the back in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:53.539" style="s2">beginning when I started in 1993 100</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:55.370" style="s2">machines was quite a lot and then it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.539" end="00:18:56.570" style="s2">a thousand machines was quite a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.370" end="00:19:00.200" style="s2">men it was ten thousand one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.570" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">thousand an hour up to millions but</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.200" end="00:19:04.909" style="s2">along the way the way we manage that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">those numbers in the way we manage</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.909" end="00:19:10.909" style="s2">complexity has changed a lot as well so</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:14.659" style="s2">in the beginning computers were simply</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.909" end="00:19:16.340" style="s2">what we call bare metal the raw computer</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.659" end="00:19:18.740" style="s2">running programs directly on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.340" end="00:19:21.110" style="s2">operating system but along the way we</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:23.630" style="s2">introduced virtual machines to try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.110" end="00:19:26.780" style="s2">manage the capacity of machines better</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.630" end="00:19:29.929" style="s2">to share workloads between different</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.780" end="00:19:32.440" style="s2">processes while maintaining some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.929" end="00:19:35.620" style="s2">secure separation between them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.440" end="00:19:38.179" style="s2">within building layer upon layer of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.620" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">virtualization on top of machines and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.179" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of changed the way we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:48.700" style="s2">to configure systems because each layer</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">needs its own configuration to manage it</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.700" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">cfengine was designed for again because</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:58.070" style="s2">of my background I&#39;ve I designed it for</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:20:01.010" style="s2">extremely large scale</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.070" end="00:20:03.170" style="s2">and for extremely diverse environments</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.010" end="00:20:06.170" style="s2">you know I was working in a university</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.170" end="00:20:08.750" style="s2">and as you know all university guys are</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.170" end="00:20:11.420" style="s2">special kids they they have special</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.750" end="00:20:13.370" style="s2">needs they won&#39;t take on a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.420" end="00:20:15.080" style="s2">industrial approach they let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.370" end="00:20:17.960" style="s2">everything the same to keep it simple</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.080" end="00:20:19.850" style="s2">for the managers no no no they need</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.960" end="00:20:21.820" style="s2">their own special way of doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.850" end="00:20:25.640" style="s2">their own particular programs and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.820" end="00:20:27.560" style="s2">their own settings so turns out we</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.640" end="00:20:29.480" style="s2">needed to do everything every department</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.560" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">at the University totally different and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.480" end="00:20:34.220" style="s2">that having a system that could adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:37.160" style="s2">those differences and still maintain</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.220" end="00:20:39.620" style="s2">them at scale to allowed to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.160" end="00:20:42.790" style="s2">precursor for what the cloud was turning</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.620" end="00:20:44.630" style="s2">into with this kind of multi-tenant</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.790" end="00:20:47.900" style="s2">environment where all kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.630" end="00:20:49.460" style="s2">have different needs overlapping so</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.900" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">cfengine was designed to be this very</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.460" end="00:20:53.690" style="s2">flexible and highly scalable thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.790" style="s2">running on bare metal and later it could</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.690" end="00:20:58.970" style="s2">be adapted to these over other scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.790" end="00:21:02.630" style="s2">and then puppet came along and did a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.970" end="00:21:07.700" style="s2">similar thing in a way that was more</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.630" end="00:21:10.250" style="s2">kind of user friendly to the system</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.700" end="00:21:12.980" style="s2">administrators people found see if my</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.250" end="00:21:15.920" style="s2">cfengine a bit too academic i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.980" end="00:21:19.430" style="s2">they found a chef to be more friendly</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.920" end="00:21:21.650" style="s2">and more programming worthy so those</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.430" end="00:21:27.550" style="s2">guys took a different a more programming</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.650" end="00:21:32.150" style="s2">kind of approach to to to configuration</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.550" end="00:21:34.870" style="s2">then along comes kubernetes and docker</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.150" end="00:21:37.160" style="s2">and these so-called containerized</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.870" end="00:21:39.680" style="s2">systems where you had a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.160" end="00:21:42.590" style="s2">packaging software where you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.680" end="00:21:45.050" style="s2">deploy software along with all of its</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.590" end="00:21:47.180" style="s2">attendant dependencies and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.050" end="00:21:49.580" style="s2">things that depended upon as a single</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.180" end="00:21:51.800" style="s2">package or as a set of related packages</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.580" end="00:21:54.950" style="s2">and all the configuration could be kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.800" end="00:21:57.860" style="s2">of baked into it in advance and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.950" end="00:22:00.160" style="s2">allowed programmers to to set up the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.860" end="00:22:04.070" style="s2">configuration and maintain it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.160" end="00:22:07.030" style="s2">if they could control the process and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.070" end="00:22:09.140" style="s2">reset the process kind of like doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.030" end="00:22:10.050" style="s2">control-alt-delete on the process but in</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.140" end="00:22:12.190" style="s2">the cloud</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.050" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">and that kind of changed the way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:17.320" style="s2">people manage systems altogether so they</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:19.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t need to have an immune system</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.320" end="00:22:22.050" style="s2">anymore hunting down these these</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.810" end="00:22:24.070" style="s2">problems they would simply let stuff die</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.050" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">this is not going back to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.070" end="00:22:29.860" style="s2">biological idea of necrosis if you like</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:31.660" style="s2">if the system dies badly well just make</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.860" end="00:22:33.130" style="s2">sure you had enough cells to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.660" end="00:22:34.690" style="s2">and if you lose a few cells doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.130" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">matter you still got plenty to back up</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.690" end="00:22:39.910" style="s2">and then just make some new ones just</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:42.820" style="s2">let them split up and make a few more</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.910" end="00:22:47.140" style="s2">copies so there was actually this shift</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.820" end="00:22:49.090" style="s2">from a quite rigid and keenly maintained</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.140" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">fragile system that needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.090" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">maintained and repaired in real time by</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:58.870" style="s2">detailed balance to a kind of a an</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:23:01.450" style="s2">approach using redundancy let&#39;s just set</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.870" end="00:23:03.010" style="s2">up a whole bunch of things in advance</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.450" end="00:23:06.250" style="s2">and if we lose a few no matter we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.010" end="00:23:08.200" style="s2">just start a few more and the the users</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.250" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">will probably never notice because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.200" end="00:23:11.650" style="s2">thing that had changed in the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:14.620" style="s2">was the web you know everything was</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.650" end="00:23:16.150" style="s2">coming online and web-based systems were</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.620" end="00:23:20.140" style="s2">built around this client-server</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.150" end="00:23:21.850" style="s2">architecture which is very much if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.140" end="00:23:23.710" style="s2">lose touch with the server we just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.850" end="00:23:25.870" style="s2">reconnect and try again</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.710" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">so everything&#39;s based on trying again</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.870" end="00:23:32.200" style="s2">we&#39;re done Dancy do it again keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">it until it works and that sort of is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.200" end="00:23:36.790" style="s2">kind of a repair loop in its own right</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.960" style="s2">and that allowed people to change the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.790" end="00:23:39.370" style="s2">way that they manage systems in</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.960" end="00:23:41.800" style="s2">kubernetes was kind of the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.370" end="00:23:43.780" style="s2">that but the self-healing aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.800" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">cfengine was built into kubernetes now</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.780" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">not at the level of individual process</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:52.050" style="s2">attributes but more at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:55.900" style="s2">these entire packages of systems</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.050" end="00:23:57.700" style="s2">managing software I must say I love</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.900" end="00:24:00.760" style="s2">docker you know I like to play around</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.700" end="00:24:02.920" style="s2">with various technologies and docker has</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.760" end="00:24:04.600" style="s2">lowered the threshold to be able to play</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.920" end="00:24:07.060" style="s2">around with some fairly advanced</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.600" end="00:24:08.830" style="s2">technology by a tremendous amount you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.060" end="00:24:10.510" style="s2">know as you said you no longer have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.830" end="00:24:11.770" style="s2">build the environment yourself you&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.510" end="00:24:13.960" style="s2">alright just give me this complete</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.770" end="00:24:16.180" style="s2">canned environment bring it down fire it</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.960" end="00:24:18.580" style="s2">up and docker you know say learn to play</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.180" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">with tensorflow or something and when</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.580" end="00:24:22.210" style="s2">you&#39;re done delete it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:23.980" style="s2">instead of it being a couple of days to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.210" end="00:24:26.740" style="s2">come up to curb you might be actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.980" end="00:24:28.630" style="s2">writing a program in an hour quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.740" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">remarkable the other thing I like about</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.630" end="00:24:33.100" style="s2">docker and similar revolution is how</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">much more efficient it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.100" end="00:24:38.169" style="s2">you know the layers of virtual machines</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:39.880" style="s2">was an unbelievable suck on performance</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.169" end="00:24:41.799" style="s2">and people are still adding those layers</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.880" end="00:24:45.580" style="s2">by the way I mean it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.799" end="00:24:47.380" style="s2">anything anytime soon this could be you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.580" end="00:24:49.390" style="s2">know actually I make myself unpopular in</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.380" end="00:24:52.570" style="s2">the IT industry by talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.390" end="00:24:56.140" style="s2">next climate crisis and we as IT</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.570" end="00:24:57.960" style="s2">developers and designers should think</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.140" end="00:25:01.000" style="s2">more about the resources we use because</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.960" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">the IT industry actually pasts as many</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.000" end="00:25:05.169" style="s2">people know passed the airline industry</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:07.390" style="s2">for its carbon emissions some years ago</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.169" end="00:25:10.570" style="s2">and it&#39;s only getting worse and when</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.390" end="00:25:12.580" style="s2">blockchain came out of course that&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.570" end="00:25:14.440" style="s2">melting one ice cap per week or</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.580" end="00:25:17.230" style="s2">something like that just to exchange</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.760" end="00:25:34.780" style="s2">directions a little bit here and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.440" end="00:25:37.450" style="s2">know from your practical work in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.780" end="00:25:39.010" style="s2">cfengine you know at least I can see you</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:41.559" style="s2">can tell me if I&#39;m full of or not</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.010" end="00:25:44.470" style="s2">you develop promise theory tell us about</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.559" end="00:25:46.360" style="s2">promise theory and maybe if there</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.470" end="00:25:49.179" style="s2">actually was a relationship to what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.360" end="00:25:50.980" style="s2">learn from cfengine and where it went</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.179" end="00:25:54.299" style="s2">from there promise theory actually did</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.980" end="00:25:57.400" style="s2">come out of my experiences with cfengine</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.299" end="00:26:01.179" style="s2">you know I wrote cfengine again in 1993</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.400" end="00:26:03.160" style="s2">pretty much by intuition and no idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.179" end="00:26:05.590" style="s2">what I was doing I just had some idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.160" end="00:26:08.290" style="s2">how it should probably work using some</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.590" end="00:26:10.750" style="s2">of my physics experience or background I</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.290" end="00:26:12.520" style="s2">suppose almost a thermodynamic or</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.750" end="00:26:16.120" style="s2">statistical mechanics approach to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.520" end="00:26:18.790" style="s2">management and then as I mentioned to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.120" end="00:26:20.919" style="s2">you I got into the theory of of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.790" end="00:26:23.320" style="s2">computers and I wanted to understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.919" end="00:26:25.270" style="s2">computers as a kind of a physics of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.320" end="00:26:29.169" style="s2">what would be a physics of computer</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.270" end="00:26:31.000" style="s2">networks and being a good physicist of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.169" end="00:26:33.370" style="s2">course I immediately tried to apply all</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.000" end="00:26:36.070" style="s2">of the tools that I knew differential</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.370" end="00:26:38.110" style="s2">calculus statistical mechanics and on</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.070" end="00:26:41.110" style="s2">and on all of these class</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.110" end="00:26:43.510" style="s2">quantitative methods and I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.110" end="00:26:45.040" style="s2">write I was making a master&#39;s degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.510" end="00:26:47.260" style="s2">actually at the University of the time</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.040" end="00:26:48.580" style="s2">and I wanted to write a textbook for</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.260" end="00:26:51.190" style="s2">this so I was trying to put down</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.580" end="00:26:53.710" style="s2">everything that I could think of and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.190" end="00:26:57.790" style="s2">tried every theory you can imagine to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.710" end="00:27:01.330" style="s2">try to analyze computers in a helpful</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.510" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">on and on and I wrote this book and made</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:16.600" style="s2">a few steps forward here and there I</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:19.950" style="s2">would say but at the end I was feeling</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.600" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">pretty disappointed in the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.950" end="00:27:25.230" style="s2">sensible predictability that you could</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.230" end="00:27:31.210" style="s2">there are very few predictable patterns</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.419" end="00:27:33.850" style="s2">and computers the only one happens in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.210" end="00:27:36.250" style="s2">very very busy service and then it turns</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:38.940" style="s2">out that servers actually look a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.250" end="00:27:41.650" style="s2">like the heat spectrum of black body</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.940" end="00:27:44.770" style="s2">because network traffic turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.650" end="00:27:47.169" style="s2">have this kind of a blackbody radiation</p>

<p begin="00:27:49.030" end="00:27:54.520" style="s2">one tiny little thing that we could</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.070" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">I realized there was one thing missing</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.870" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">and that was intent you know when we</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.330" end="00:29:23.860" style="s2">different alternatives are equivalent to</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.190" end="00:29:31.930" style="s2">couldn&#39;t happen of course you can wish</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.430" end="00:29:33.390" style="s2">for them if you like but but they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.930" end="00:29:37.210" style="s2">they won&#39;t come about so you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.390" end="00:29:39.040" style="s2">eliminate them in some way and and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.210" end="00:29:42.040" style="s2">told me that there would be some process</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.040" end="00:29:44.290" style="s2">of things that could happen and things</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.040" end="00:29:46.300" style="s2">that would select them a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.290" end="00:29:50.680" style="s2">you have mutation and selection in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.300" end="00:29:53.740" style="s2">evolution but in any kind of process in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.680" end="00:29:55.930" style="s2">which something is developing causally</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:58.300" style="s2">in time you would have things that could</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.930" end="00:30:01.630" style="s2">unfold and things that could proven that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.300" end="00:30:05.680" style="s2">tree of alternatives and this led me</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.630" end="00:30:09.550" style="s2">into the notion of where what eventually</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.680" end="00:30:12.610" style="s2">called promises and promises form a kind</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.630" end="00:30:28.930" style="s2">the important thing about computers that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:31.570" style="s2">I had understood from from looking at</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.200" end="00:30:44.770" style="s2">was humans so it makes no sense to speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.350" end="00:30:47.140" style="s2">about computers in isolation from humans</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.770" end="00:30:48.540" style="s2">we have to speak about human computer</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.940" end="00:32:15.990" style="s2">to a kind of a network view of the world</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.280" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">drill down a little bit some of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.060" end="00:32:47.250" style="s2">throughout the book or at least quite a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.190" end="00:32:51.060" style="s2">bit in the book its contrast the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.010" end="00:32:58.830" style="s2">became my favorite subject</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.020" end="00:33:46.850" style="s2">actually wrote 0 and 1 as we sometimes</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:55.580" style="s2">tomato and that agent in the middle has</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.170" end="00:34:58.610" style="s2">no way of resolving that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.580" end="00:35:01.940" style="s2">because the conflict arose elsewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.610" end="00:35:04.090" style="s2">these two other agents and it has no</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.940" end="00:35:07.010" style="s2">power over those the source of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.090" end="00:35:09.310" style="s2">obligations so obligations are</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.010" end="00:35:11.780" style="s2">fundamentally hard to resolve because</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.310" end="00:35:13.590" style="s2">obligations come from without rather</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.780" end="00:35:17.150" style="s2">from within</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.590" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">what I realized was something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.150" end="00:35:21.390" style="s2">important in physics especially in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:27.170" style="s2">quantum physics and that is the notion</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.390" end="00:35:29.460" style="s2">of locality that if you only base</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.170" end="00:35:32.250" style="s2">descriptions a system on what happens</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.460" end="00:35:35.160" style="s2">from the location at which the property</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.250" end="00:35:37.170" style="s2">is asserted that property comes from</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.160" end="00:35:40.620" style="s2">within then you can always resolve</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.170" end="00:35:43.110" style="s2">conflicts because if I say to you tomato</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.620" end="00:35:46.050" style="s2">or tomato that might be inconsistent but</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.110" end="00:35:48.630" style="s2">I can choose one of the other and decide</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.050" end="00:35:51.330" style="s2">which of them I want to go with and I am</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.630" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">able to detect that inconsistency myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.330" end="00:36:00.630" style="s2">I actually used this idea in cfengine to</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:03.690" style="s2">detect conflicts of policy so if a user</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.630" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">had tried to say I want this program to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.690" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">be switched on although I want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.460" end="00:36:10.710" style="s2">always switched off that&#39;s a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:14.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s clearly resolvable as long as</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.710" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">that policy comes from the same source</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.840" end="00:36:18.390" style="s2">my computer can decide for itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.130" style="s2">whether it wants to do it or it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.390" end="00:36:22.830" style="s2">want to do it and it can choose between</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.130" end="00:36:25.410" style="s2">them but if those obligations come from</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.830" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">without then they will simply compete to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.410" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">try and switch it on switch it off</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:32.010" style="s2">switch it on switch it off and there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:34.980" style="s2">be an endless competition between the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.010" end="00:36:38.370" style="s2">two which is destructive so this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.980" end="00:36:40.890" style="s2">promise captures the notion of what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.370" end="00:36:42.780" style="s2">would call locality in physics where</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.890" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">rule-based systems can be completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.780" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">consistent and have proper resolutions</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:51.990" style="s2">versus systems where things are imposed</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:53.940" style="s2">from without if you like have</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.990" end="00:36:56.040" style="s2">contradictory external boundary</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.940" end="00:36:58.590" style="s2">conditions and will forever be in</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.040" end="00:37:00.510" style="s2">competition with one another and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.590" end="00:37:03.690" style="s2">allows you to build a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.510" end="00:37:06.120" style="s2">stability which is again another way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.690" end="00:37:09.060" style="s2">saying this this idea of an immune</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.120" end="00:37:11.910" style="s2">system what an immune system does is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.060" end="00:37:15.050" style="s2">creates semantic and dynamical stability</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.910" end="00:37:16.610" style="s2">in a functional system</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.050" end="00:37:19.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we wanted to try to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.610" end="00:37:20.600" style="s2">achieve for computers as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.160" end="00:37:23.450" style="s2">think that&#39;s what you can say the state</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.600" end="00:37:26.540" style="s2">of modern management has really taken on</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.450" end="00:37:29.990" style="s2">board that idea in in the way that we do</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.540" end="00:37:31.670" style="s2">things today yep I really like the well</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.990" end="00:37:34.280" style="s2">I thought it was the base level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.670" end="00:37:37.250" style="s2">simplicity then only an agent can make</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.280" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">promises of itself right and as you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.250" end="00:37:42.200" style="s2">pointed out the number of contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:43.940" style="s2">that the system has is much less when</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.200" end="00:37:46.550" style="s2">only an agent can make a promise about</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.940" end="00:37:48.590" style="s2">itself rather than having various agents</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.550" end="00:37:51.140" style="s2">trying to put obligations on each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.590" end="00:37:53.660" style="s2">however as you pointed out this results</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.140" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">in a kind of relativity problem right in</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.660" end="00:37:58.130" style="s2">that any agent can make its own</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:00.200" style="s2">sometimes contradicting assessments of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.130" end="00:38:02.420" style="s2">whether a promise or another agent</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.200" end="00:38:04.070" style="s2">fulfilled the promise or not so one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.420" end="00:38:06.440" style="s2">the implications of what I might call</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.070" end="00:38:10.790" style="s2">that information relativity yep exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.440" end="00:38:11.900" style="s2">right so of course this is super</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.790" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">interesting for me because this goes</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.900" end="00:38:18.050" style="s2">right back to the the huge shift that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:21.050" style="s2">happened in physics in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.050" end="00:38:23.510" style="s2">from this Newtonian view of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.050" end="00:38:26.870" style="s2">which the universe is kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.510" end="00:38:30.140" style="s2">obligation imposed by God these these</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.870" end="00:38:32.990" style="s2">laws of physics are almost like a handle</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.140" end="00:38:34.370" style="s2">that God is turning with his own hand</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.990" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">and driving the universe</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.370" end="00:38:39.050" style="s2">deterministically into this picture</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:41.570" style="s2">first picked up on by Einstein which</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.050" end="00:38:43.220" style="s2">showed that actually what you see in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.570" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">universe depends very much on where you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.220" end="00:38:48.230" style="s2">are and what you&#39;re doing at the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">and which processes are available to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.230" end="00:38:53.870" style="s2">which ones you have information about</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:55.870" style="s2">and that introduced the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.870" end="00:38:58.730" style="s2">communication or the channel of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.870" end="00:39:01.490" style="s2">information between a source and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.730" end="00:39:05.030" style="s2">receiver the phenomenon being observed</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.490" end="00:39:08.600" style="s2">and the the user of that phenomenon or</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.030" end="00:39:10.970" style="s2">the observer of that phenomenon and in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.600" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">computer network of course this comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.970" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">about all the time because computer</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:17.360" style="s2">networks are built on the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:20.300" style="s2">services and clients a server will will</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.360" end="00:39:23.180" style="s2">say serve up webpages or a database or</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.300" end="00:39:25.130" style="s2">or something of this nature and a client</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.180" end="00:39:27.430" style="s2">will be trying to observe the database</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.130" end="00:39:29.589" style="s2">or pull out their</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.430" end="00:39:32.770" style="s2">results of that service from a different</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.589" end="00:39:35.020" style="s2">location entirely so you have one local</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.770" end="00:39:37.569" style="s2">system which knows all about its data</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.020" end="00:39:39.730" style="s2">and then you have another system on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.569" end="00:39:42.300" style="s2">other side of the planet perhaps trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.730" end="00:39:44.410" style="s2">to observe the data from a distance</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.300" end="00:39:46.510" style="s2">possibly through multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.410" end="00:39:50.430" style="s2">routes through the network different</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.510" end="00:39:53.940" style="s2">pathways and all of those problems that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.430" end="00:39:56.859" style="s2">emerged in 20th century physics are now</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.940" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">reimagine in the computer network the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.859" end="00:40:01.690" style="s2">idea that messages can take multiple</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:04.210" style="s2">paths and interfere with one another the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.690" end="00:40:06.910" style="s2">idea that certain information could have</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.210" end="00:40:09.849" style="s2">be reversed in its order because I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.910" end="00:40:11.859" style="s2">travel them along one path the speed of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.849" end="00:40:13.390" style="s2">communication is different from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.859" end="00:40:17.410" style="s2">speed of communication on another path</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.390" end="00:40:20.200" style="s2">allowing inconsistencies to arise and if</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.410" end="00:40:23.589" style="s2">you try to impose collaboration between</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.200" end="00:40:26.170" style="s2">systems by obligation by pushing data</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.589" end="00:40:29.309" style="s2">you can easily find that those</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.170" end="00:40:31.960" style="s2">obligations as impositions of of data</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.309" end="00:40:36.040" style="s2">turn out to be absolutely inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.960" end="00:40:38.290" style="s2">and unresolvable whereas if you take the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.040" end="00:40:41.319" style="s2">opposite view which is the Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.290" end="00:40:44.589" style="s2">observer view the local observer view</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.319" end="00:40:47.790" style="s2">that each observer make some</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.790" end="00:40:54.579" style="s2">promises to resolve conflicts or</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.920" end="00:40:58.030" style="s2">differences that it sees by its own hand</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.579" end="00:41:00.549" style="s2">as it were then it becomes up to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.030" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">observer to resolve those difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.549" end="00:41:06.819" style="s2">and find the intended outcome now this</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">is interesting on the number of levels</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.819" end="00:41:12.220" style="s2">first of all leading implicates</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">Shannon&#39;s theory of communication which</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.220" end="00:41:17.890" style="s2">was the idea of having a sender and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:19.390" style="s2">receiver the sender will send a certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.890" end="00:41:22.210" style="s2">message and the receiver will try to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.390" end="00:41:25.210" style="s2">receive it but the receiver may be</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.210" end="00:41:28.420" style="s2">either unable or unwilling to receive</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.210" end="00:41:31.530" style="s2">the message it might be distorted it</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.420" end="00:41:33.819" style="s2">might be in a different language the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.530" end="00:41:35.950" style="s2">resolution of the receiver might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.819" end="00:41:37.720" style="s2">unable to discern the different symbols</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.950" end="00:41:40.230" style="s2">that might be errors he might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.720" end="00:41:43.710" style="s2">encrypted again on and on</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.230" end="00:41:46.290" style="s2">so what is promised by the source of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.710" end="00:41:49.500" style="s2">message of service and observation is</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.290" end="00:41:51.590" style="s2">not necessarily accepted or received by</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.500" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">the receiver and this adds an additional</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.590" end="00:41:57.240" style="s2">degree of freedom and premise theory</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:59.730" style="s2">that is somehow related to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.240" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">of source and receiver in in Shannon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.730" end="00:42:04.980" style="s2">theory what he would call the overlap of</p>

<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:20.900" style="s2">we have this curious reformulations of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.640" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">physics in which what originates from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.900" end="00:42:28.050" style="s2">physical system is then collapsed onto a</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.050" end="00:42:32.220" style="s2">like these pathways we were talking</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.220" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">intentional outcomes if you will which</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.820" end="00:42:45.540" style="s2">mechanics and that matching between the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.150" end="00:42:47.369" style="s2">two is almost like the acceptance of or</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.540" end="00:42:49.710" style="s2">the overlap function between what is</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.710" end="00:42:54.090" style="s2">receiver with a limited number of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.720" end="00:42:56.609" style="s2">degrees of freedom which is analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.090" end="00:42:58.830" style="s2">what Shannon thought of as an alphabet</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.609" end="00:43:02.550" style="s2">of possibilities in the theory of</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.070" end="00:43:11.130" style="s2">this additional degree of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.670" end="00:43:15.300" style="s2">between offer and acceptance plays now</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.130" end="00:43:18.690" style="s2">an important role in the semantics of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.300" end="00:43:22.109" style="s2">the system we use that to our good</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.690" end="00:43:25.109" style="s2">intent for example in security we will I</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.109" end="00:43:27.840" style="s2">grant you access to my my system or not</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.109" end="00:43:29.700" style="s2">you may try to impose information on me</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.840" end="00:43:32.310" style="s2">but will I accept it or not no I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.700" end="00:43:33.840" style="s2">filter your packet on the network even</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.310" end="00:43:36.180" style="s2">though you sent it to me I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.840" end="00:43:38.700" style="s2">hear that I want to filter out all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.180" end="00:43:41.670" style="s2">all of the fake news from Facebook I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.700" end="00:43:44.150" style="s2">want to I have a policy about this on</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.670" end="00:43:47.130" style="s2">that and the same thing works both on</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.150" end="00:43:48.610" style="s2">receiving requests to supply information</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.130" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">at a server</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.610" end="00:43:52.980" style="s2">and it applies once the server replies</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:55.810" style="s2">with it with data in the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.980" end="00:43:58.170" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind of a filtering which</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.810" end="00:44:00.340" style="s2">goes on between sender and receiver</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.170" end="00:44:02.680" style="s2">again as a physicist what I find</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.340" end="00:44:04.990" style="s2">interesting there is that that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.680" end="00:44:08.140" style="s2">filtering has the analogous role to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.990" end="00:44:09.850" style="s2">the hermitian operators that you insert</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.140" end="00:44:13.300" style="s2">into the quantum mechanical wave</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.850" end="00:44:15.300" style="s2">functions in quantum mechanics to to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.300" end="00:44:18.490" style="s2">extract certain properties of the system</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.300" end="00:44:19.960" style="s2">in a consistent way so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.490" end="00:44:23.020" style="s2">absolutely fascinating thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.960" end="00:44:24.580" style="s2">happening in in cloud computing because</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.020" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">of all of the layers of virtualization</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.580" end="00:44:31.980" style="s2">that are taking place and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:34.840" style="s2">as we get closer and closer to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.980" end="00:44:36.220" style="s2">virtualized world of processes</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.840" end="00:44:39.490" style="s2">interacting we&#39;re getting closer and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.220" end="00:44:41.530" style="s2">closer to seeing these very bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.490" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">phenomena that have confused us in</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.530" end="00:44:45.400" style="s2">quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:46.660" style="s2">perhaps for a similar reason or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.400" end="00:44:49.420" style="s2">for totally different reason we of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.660" end="00:44:51.730" style="s2">course we don&#39;t truly know but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.420" end="00:44:53.320" style="s2">that idea which goes back to Newton that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.730" end="00:44:56.110" style="s2">similar phenomena may have similar</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.320" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">explanations opens an intriguing</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.110" end="00:45:00.760" style="s2">possibility which is that we may be able</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:03.540" style="s2">to learn something about quantum systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.760" end="00:45:07.300" style="s2">by actually looking at how our</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.540" end="00:45:11.710" style="s2">technology now exhibits phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.300" end="00:45:13.330" style="s2">seems somewhat counterintuitive but at</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.710" end="00:45:15.670" style="s2">the same time somewhat familiar from</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.330" end="00:45:16.870" style="s2">quantum mechanics very interesting let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.670" end="00:45:19.900" style="s2">bring it down one level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.870" end="00:45:21.910" style="s2">that was very very deep but let&#39;s bring</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.900" end="00:45:24.010" style="s2">it down a level or two or three of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.910" end="00:45:26.110" style="s2">abstraction and maybe you can tell us</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.010" end="00:45:29.110" style="s2">how promise Theory either does or</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.110" end="00:45:31.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t shine a light on what is one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.110" end="00:45:34.200" style="s2">the big issues in distributed systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.000" end="00:45:38.320" style="s2">today which is the trade-off between</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.200" end="00:45:40.300" style="s2">consistency and scalability and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.320" end="00:45:42.730" style="s2">systems have chosen one form or another</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.300" end="00:45:45.100" style="s2">of what which is called eventually</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.730" end="00:45:48.040" style="s2">consistent you know think about people</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.100" end="00:45:50.230" style="s2">like MongoDB Cassandra and one of my</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.040" end="00:45:53.650" style="s2">current phase was it&#39;s just so cool</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.230" end="00:45:55.930" style="s2">Apaches ignite does promise theory or</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.650" end="00:45:57.550" style="s2">other aspects of your work tell us how</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.930" end="00:46:00.980" style="s2">we should think about this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.550" end="00:46:04.070" style="s2">eventually consistent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.980" end="00:46:05.810" style="s2">umm I like this topic very much because</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.070" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">it is exactly one of those cases where</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.810" end="00:46:10.700" style="s2">the quantitative the qualitative the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:14.290" style="s2">relativity and all of these issues come</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.700" end="00:46:17.750" style="s2">into play for a very concrete practical</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.290" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">purpose I&#39;ll try and not to get get too</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.750" end="00:46:22.550" style="s2">deep into it let&#39;s let&#39;s see let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:24.830" style="s2">if we can start simply first so this</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.550" end="00:46:28.340" style="s2">idea of consistency first of all is is</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.830" end="00:46:31.730" style="s2">the idea that all of the observers in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.340" end="00:46:34.550" style="s2">system in a distributed system would</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.730" end="00:46:37.160" style="s2">always see the same answer when they</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.550" end="00:46:40.520" style="s2">asked the same question of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.160" end="00:46:43.190" style="s2">service now this of course would be what</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.520" end="00:46:45.890" style="s2">we would like to happen because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.190" end="00:46:47.300" style="s2">with constructed computer systems based</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.890" end="00:46:51.230" style="s2">on the idea that we only had one</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.300" end="00:46:53.300" style="s2">computer in the beginning and so of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.230" end="00:46:56.440" style="s2">course one computer is always consistent</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.300" end="00:46:58.760" style="s2">with itself just as if you read one book</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.440" end="00:47:01.070" style="s2">the words aren&#39;t changing in front of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.760" end="00:47:02.690" style="s2">your eyes but if you listen to a story</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.070" end="00:47:05.270" style="s2">from multiple different storytellers as</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.690" end="00:47:08.930" style="s2">it&#39;s being spread through the rumor mill</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.270" end="00:47:11.960" style="s2">you might get 20 different answers which</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.930" end="00:47:13.570" style="s2">might not be consistent all so this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.960" end="00:47:17.869" style="s2">not good because you would like</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.570" end="00:47:20.270" style="s2">computers to be reliable especially if</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.869" end="00:47:24.080" style="s2">it&#39;s your money that&#39;s involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.270" end="00:47:27.380" style="s2">bank and so on but of course we believe</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.080" end="00:47:29.570" style="s2">very much in this notion of truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.380" end="00:47:31.640" style="s2">water world no matter how naive that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.570" end="00:47:35.510" style="s2">might be so we want simple answers to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.640" end="00:47:37.340" style="s2">simple questions of course what Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.510" end="00:47:39.380" style="s2">showed us is that different observers</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.340" end="00:47:41.000" style="s2">will tend to see different answers</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.380" end="00:47:45.850" style="s2">depending on all kinds of different</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.000" end="00:47:49.430" style="s2">reasons associated with the channel</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.850" end="00:47:51.950" style="s2">between the sender and the receiver it</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.430" end="00:47:55.460" style="s2">could be because there is a finite speed</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.950" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">of communication so updates that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.460" end="00:48:01.369" style="s2">made from one source take longer to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">propagate to some listeners than to</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.369" end="00:48:10.369" style="s2">others so the time at which a listener</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:12.820" style="s2">or reader tries to ask a question might</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.369" end="00:48:15.080" style="s2">be critical to the answer that they get</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.820" end="00:48:17.340" style="s2">and as I mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.080" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">actually influence the order in which</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.340" end="00:48:24.360" style="s2">they see certain events so if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:26.520" style="s2">is trying to resolve a question about do</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.360" end="00:48:29.460" style="s2">you owe interest to the bank because</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.520" end="00:48:31.170" style="s2">your account was overdrawn you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.460" end="00:48:33.360" style="s2">interested in knowing did I pay the bill</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.170" end="00:48:35.940" style="s2">before or after I received my paycheck</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.360" end="00:48:38.910" style="s2">in other words was my account overdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.940" end="00:48:41.850" style="s2">for a few days or was it actually never</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.910" end="00:48:43.650" style="s2">overdrawn the answer that question might</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.850" end="00:48:45.840" style="s2">not be resolved in the same way by</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.650" end="00:48:48.030" style="s2">different observers so clearly this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.840" end="00:48:50.430" style="s2">an important issue of course it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.030" end="00:48:53.970" style="s2">performance issue right yes the tighter</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.430" end="00:48:55.950" style="s2">you try to make that or the minimize the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.970" end="00:48:59.340" style="s2">relativity of views the more expensive</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.950" end="00:49:00.870" style="s2">by an exponential it turns out it is to</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.340" end="00:49:02.760" style="s2">maintain a large-scale distributed</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.870" end="00:49:05.460" style="s2">system so there&#39;s you know sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.760" end="00:49:08.310" style="s2">highest level design perspective of how</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.460" end="00:49:10.680" style="s2">long does eventually consistent means or</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.310" end="00:49:13.860" style="s2">how big can the relativity be exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.680" end="00:49:16.080" style="s2">and where scale comes in is is in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.860" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">the distance and therefore the time it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.080" end="00:49:21.030" style="s2">takes to make that measurement and also</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:23.160" style="s2">the amount of data that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.030" end="00:49:26.670" style="s2">transmitted because obviously it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.160" end="00:49:29.010" style="s2">longer amount of time to equilibrator or</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.670" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">make consistent a large amount of data</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.010" end="00:49:35.220" style="s2">than a smaller amount of data and again</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:37.260" style="s2">for our readers the this is especially</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.220" end="00:49:39.150" style="s2">critical for databases because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.260" end="00:49:42.350" style="s2">process by which databases are</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.150" end="00:49:45.330" style="s2">maintained unmade consistence is</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.350" end="00:49:47.850" style="s2">drastically more inefficient than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.330" end="00:49:49.380" style="s2">process by which databases can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.850" end="00:49:52.020" style="s2">queried and the reason for that is they</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.380" end="00:49:54.080" style="s2">have to be serialized in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.020" end="00:49:57.960" style="s2">things in the right order and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.080" end="00:50:01.560" style="s2">serialization leads to single threaded</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.960" end="00:50:03.390" style="s2">very slow-moving queues that tend to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.560" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">build up and resolve very quickly like</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.390" end="00:50:08.580" style="s2">traffic jams in the internet and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:11.430" style="s2">there&#39;s these two philosophies one</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.580" end="00:50:14.910" style="s2">called absolute consistency or acid</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.430" end="00:50:17.400" style="s2">consistency and this countervailing</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.910" end="00:50:22.230" style="s2">based consistency or eventual</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.400" end="00:50:25.050" style="s2">consistency that that says okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.230" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">gonna respond to you very quickly but</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.050" end="00:50:28.030" style="s2">the answer you get might not be exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:31.000" style="s2">the same as you hear from some</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.030" end="00:50:33.660" style="s2">else deal with it your is up to you as</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.000" end="00:50:35.950" style="s2">an independent observer to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.660" end="00:50:37.900" style="s2">that would be a kind of a promise based</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.950" end="00:50:40.450" style="s2">approach because it&#39;s putting the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.900" end="00:50:42.520" style="s2">responsibility onto the receiver to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.450" end="00:50:44.560" style="s2">resolve that inconsistency themselves</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.520" end="00:50:46.930" style="s2">because they have that control to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.560" end="00:50:49.360" style="s2">able to do so the alternative is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.930" end="00:50:52.300" style="s2">absolute consistency at the source which</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.360" end="00:50:54.850" style="s2">tries to make it an obligation on all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.300" end="00:50:56.830" style="s2">the potential suppliers of that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.850" end="00:50:59.260" style="s2">little cartel if you like of service</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.830" end="00:51:02.110" style="s2">that that are promising the information</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.260" end="00:51:04.600" style="s2">they&#39;d all better be consistent or else</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.110" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">and the only way that they can promise</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.600" end="00:51:08.740" style="s2">that is to check with each other all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:12.010" style="s2">the time whether or not they have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.740" end="00:51:13.540" style="s2">same information in spite of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.010" end="00:51:15.340" style="s2">possible changes that may be coming in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.540" end="00:51:17.470" style="s2">from all over the place and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.340" end="00:51:21.160" style="s2">requires them to talk to everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.470" end="00:51:22.590" style="s2">in a kind of an N squared process for</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.160" end="00:51:26.050" style="s2">the mathematical people in the audience</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.590" end="00:51:30.340" style="s2">you can talk em clients can talk to a</p>

<p begin="00:51:30.340" end="00:51:33.970" style="s2">M servers are trying to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.080" end="00:51:36.550" style="s2">everybody else in the network it takes</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.970" end="00:51:38.670" style="s2">something of order N squared or n times</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.550" end="00:51:41.350" style="s2">m to do that which is much much slower</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.670" end="00:51:44.260" style="s2">get a thousand servers it&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.350" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">all right exactly and so they the number</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.260" end="00:51:47.530" style="s2">of servers that you can have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:51.850" style="s2">replicate your data is very very small</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.530" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s typically three to seven is the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.850" end="00:51:56.920" style="s2">rule of thumb and it&#39;s an odd number for</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:52:00.340" style="s2">other reasons but that&#39;s typically the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.920" end="00:52:04.180" style="s2">rule of thumb that people can can expect</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.340" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">to waiter an acceptable amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.180" end="00:52:08.890" style="s2">in order to equilibrate those data</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:11.380" style="s2">before giving a request and even you</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.890" end="00:52:12.520" style="s2">know seven is already slow the googles</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.380" end="00:52:14.740" style="s2">of the world because they have these</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.520" end="00:52:17.020" style="s2">ultra-fast networks and fast service can</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.740" end="00:52:20.530" style="s2">get away with that for very small</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.020" end="00:52:22.750" style="s2">amounts of data but whenever your amount</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.530" end="00:52:24.520" style="s2">of data gets large you can forget about</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.750" end="00:52:26.440" style="s2">that consistency and you&#39;re early then</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.520" end="00:52:28.150" style="s2">stuck with so-called eventual</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.440" end="00:52:30.040" style="s2">consistency and of course that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.150" end="00:52:32.350" style="s2">model which is used by all of the social</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.040" end="00:52:34.030" style="s2">media companies because they have such</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.350" end="00:52:36.520" style="s2">enormous amounts of data that they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.030" end="00:52:38.650" style="s2">no hope of being able to make it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.520" end="00:52:40.330" style="s2">strictly consistent yeah I&#39;m the course</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.650" end="00:52:41.500" style="s2">semantically you have to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.330" end="00:52:44.350" style="s2">semantics from</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.500" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">many applications in the world the level</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.350" end="00:52:48.310" style="s2">of consistency is not very important you</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:51.190" style="s2">know for example if I&#39;m looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.310" end="00:52:54.100" style="s2">toaster on Amazon and I want to know how</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.190" end="00:52:55.600" style="s2">many stars it has right my usual rule of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.100" end="00:52:57.580" style="s2">thumb is don&#39;t buy it unless it has four</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.600" end="00:53:00.100" style="s2">and a half stars right whether that</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.580" end="00:53:02.200" style="s2">information is one minute or even one</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.100" end="00:53:04.180" style="s2">hours old doesn&#39;t really matter to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.200" end="00:53:05.530" style="s2">making my decision as long as the end is</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.180" end="00:53:07.420" style="s2">bigger bigger than a hundred is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.530" end="00:53:10.060" style="s2">usual number I use so in which case the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.420" end="00:53:12.310" style="s2">semantics of consistency would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.060" end="00:53:15.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter much yeah so do your best</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.310" end="00:53:17.410" style="s2">job and if all viewers of Amazon even</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.160" end="00:53:19.570" style="s2">have an hour window of slop about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.410" end="00:53:20.320" style="s2">star rating on a given toaster it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.570" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.320" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">on the other hand the example you gave</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:28.150" style="s2">you know the order in which debits and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:30.190" style="s2">credits are done on a bank ledger well</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.150" end="00:53:32.770" style="s2">for some applications it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.190" end="00:53:34.510" style="s2">real time it&#39;s not that many but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.770" end="00:53:37.270" style="s2">know again eventual consistency in time</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.510" end="00:53:39.700" style="s2">for calculating fees is probably where</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.270" end="00:53:41.020" style="s2">the semantics comes in so what has to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.700" end="00:53:42.610" style="s2">smart and thinking about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.020" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">trying to accomplish when one thinks</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.610" end="00:53:46.390" style="s2">about these things exactly right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:48.930" style="s2">again coming back to your point at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.390" end="00:53:52.180" style="s2">beginning Jim about why if physicists</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.930" end="00:53:55.630" style="s2">why do we have a role to play an IT I</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.180" end="00:53:58.570" style="s2">think in physics where we&#39;re taught from</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.630" end="00:54:02.490" style="s2">the very beginning to assume uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.570" end="00:54:05.310" style="s2">in measurements and to deal with it by a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.490" end="00:54:07.570" style="s2">statistical means or by repeating</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.310" end="00:54:11.710" style="s2">experiments again and again and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.570" end="00:54:13.480" style="s2">building up a picture of a time to take</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.710" end="00:54:15.130" style="s2">into account the uncertainties but</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.480" end="00:54:17.710" style="s2">there&#39;s no culture of this in computer</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.130" end="00:54:20.140" style="s2">science computer science was built</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.710" end="00:54:23.170" style="s2">around this idea of logic true or false</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.140" end="00:54:25.180" style="s2">the answer is either one thing or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.170" end="00:54:29.080" style="s2">not there is no in between there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.180" end="00:54:31.420" style="s2">uncertainty or no variability no</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.080" end="00:54:34.600" style="s2">multiplicity if you will no plurality of</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.420" end="00:54:36.760" style="s2">of answers that you can get but this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.600" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">turning out to be entirely untenable in</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.760" end="00:54:42.870" style="s2">a world at scale the kind of world we</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:45.730" style="s2">were talking about in the cloud where</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.870" end="00:54:48.070" style="s2">the measurement outcome of a measurement</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.730" end="00:54:50.230" style="s2">is now looking again a bit like quantum</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.070" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">mechanics it could collapse to any one</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.230" end="00:54:53.790" style="s2">of a number of different values</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:55.390" style="s2">depending on how and exactly when that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.790" end="00:54:58.510" style="s2">collapse takes</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.390" end="00:55:01.510" style="s2">place so this is an area where physics</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.510" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">can really contribute to designing</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.510" end="00:55:08.049" style="s2">systems because we can build in</p>

<p begin="00:55:15.279" end="00:55:20.289" style="s2">in a way which computers simply can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:22.359" style="s2">I mean a funny story about this as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.289" end="00:55:24.369" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s almost in its a bit of I was</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.359" end="00:55:26.279" style="s2">a bit embarrassed by it but one of my</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.369" end="00:55:30.010" style="s2">colleagues at the University had just</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.279" end="00:55:33.039" style="s2">graduated his PhD and we had been in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.010" end="00:55:34.690" style="s2">subject of object orientation an object</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.039" end="00:55:36.069" style="s2">orientation is one of those philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.690" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">in computer science that she comes from</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.069" end="00:55:41.369" style="s2">Oslo so I should probably be careful</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:43.990" style="s2">when I say about this but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.369" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">top-down philosophy that&#39;s tries to</p>

<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:53.950" style="s2">types and related activities but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.740" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">basically an obligation model and they</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.779" end="00:56:18.279" style="s2">for a few minutes and I I simply drew a</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.760" end="00:57:28.830" style="s2">let&#39;s now turn from promise Theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.210" end="00:57:30.390" style="s2">applied to computing to some other</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.830" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">topics but before we do that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.390" end="00:57:34.740" style="s2">jump back and hit two things from our</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.400" end="00:57:37.980" style="s2">previous discussion the first is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.740" end="00:57:39.840" style="s2">you pointed out the antic logic has not</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.980" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">been very satisfying in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.840" end="00:57:43.590" style="s2">actually useful results particularly</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:45.510" style="s2">people tried to apply it in AI of you</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.590" end="00:57:48.180" style="s2">know and ended up in dead ends but</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.510" end="00:57:49.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a another alternative that been</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.180" end="00:57:51.180" style="s2">Gert cyl I mentioned before who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.770" end="00:57:53.460" style="s2">actually been on the show before has</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.180" end="00:57:55.830" style="s2">developed called probabilistic logic</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.460" end="00:57:59.460" style="s2">networks where he does exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.830" end="00:58:01.710" style="s2">say is build formally into his logic</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.460" end="00:58:03.840" style="s2">formalism the sense that every logical</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.710" end="00:58:06.360" style="s2">statement is uncertain in a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.840" end="00:58:08.340" style="s2">different ways and he&#39;s finding that to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.360" end="00:58:09.860" style="s2">actually be quite useful any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.340" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">about whether that sounds reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.860" end="00:58:16.680" style="s2">absolutely this is actually taking us</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:19.010" style="s2">interval into the area of AI now and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.680" end="00:58:21.780" style="s2">machine learning and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.010" end="00:58:24.510" style="s2">going back to the late nineties when I</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.780" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">was building cfengine and this computer</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.510" end="00:58:28.650" style="s2">immunology study I came up with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:30.270" style="s2">that we really needed to learn the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.650" end="00:58:32.340" style="s2">patterns of behavior in systems in real</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.270" end="00:58:34.470" style="s2">time and one way to do that was to</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.340" end="00:58:37.110" style="s2">gather information get the machine to</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.470" end="00:58:39.980" style="s2">learn its own behavior and and try to</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.110" end="00:58:42.060" style="s2">look for patterns within that over time</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.980" end="00:58:43.770" style="s2">when you do that wouldn&#39;t you are</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.060" end="00:58:45.650" style="s2">basically learning this is called</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.770" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">unsupervised learning it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.650" end="00:58:53.490" style="s2">real-time learning without some kind of</p>

<p begin="00:58:53.490" end="00:58:58.500" style="s2">upfront so it&#39;s really trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:02.610" style="s2">stuff out as you go along fly by the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.500" end="00:59:03.930" style="s2">seat of your pants if you will and when</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.610" end="00:59:06.060" style="s2">you build when you learn in that way</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.930" end="00:59:09.210" style="s2">you&#39;re building up a picture which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.060" end="00:59:11.310" style="s2">longitudinal in the probabilities you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.210" end="00:59:13.830" style="s2">measuring data a bit like when you are</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.310" end="00:59:15.990" style="s2">doing polling for an election or</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.830" end="00:59:18.850" style="s2">something you&#39;re seeing changes in real</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.990" end="00:59:22.090" style="s2">time and you&#39;re aggregating the results</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.850" end="00:59:26.020" style="s2">in time longer to delay one after the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.090" end="00:59:28.090" style="s2">other like a queue that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.020" end="00:59:30.160" style="s2">what we normally do in probabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.090" end="00:59:33.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not what we doing statistical</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:36.280" style="s2">mechanics in physics or in probability</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.370" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">theory what you tend to do there is to</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.280" end="00:59:44.380" style="s2">aggregate data transversely or over</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:47.650" style="s2">space rather than time so you look for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.380" end="00:59:49.720" style="s2">bunch of equivalence instances that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.650" end="00:59:51.820" style="s2">can compare which are running in</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.720" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">parallel and you&#39;ll say I want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.820" end="00:59:56.020" style="s2">compare myself to this or to that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:59.170" style="s2">then build my notion of what&#39;s normal or</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.020" end="01:00:01.480" style="s2">not normal based on multiple instances</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.170" end="01:00:03.490" style="s2">so for example in biology you have all</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.480" end="01:00:05.740" style="s2">these redundant cells and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.490" end="01:00:07.330" style="s2">looking at looking at the mall and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.740" end="01:00:09.790" style="s2">saying this is normal and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.330" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">cancer cell that ones that one&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.790" end="01:00:14.980" style="s2">normal s definitely got a different</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:17.740" style="s2">signature than these other guys so the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.980" end="01:00:21.370" style="s2">way you aggregate data and former or</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.740" end="01:00:25.360" style="s2">what we call an ensemble - or a body of</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.370" end="01:00:27.700" style="s2">data - to form your body of certainty as</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.360" end="01:00:29.530" style="s2">it were the way you aggregate that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.700" end="01:00:31.660" style="s2">important with if you do it in time or</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.530" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">in space or longitudinally or</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.660" end="01:00:38.110" style="s2">transversely and if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:39.790" style="s2">service-oriented system you have no</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.110" end="01:00:42.250" style="s2">choice but to do this longer - dinelli</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.790" end="01:00:45.250" style="s2">and if you&#39;re loading to adapt to a</p>

<p begin="01:00:52.390" end="01:00:57.910" style="s2">than in space but if you are if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.720" end="01:00:59.340" style="s2">trying to pre train a deep learning</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:11.220" style="s2">move on to a very quick discussion of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.660" end="01:04:13.700" style="s2">another thing that you talked about in</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.220" end="01:04:15.150" style="s2">passing one of my favorite bugaboos</p>

<p begin="01:04:15.150" end="01:04:18.960" style="s2">frankly I&#39;ve come around to the view</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.100" end="01:04:21.120" style="s2">that freewill isn&#39;t even worth talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.960" end="01:04:23.700" style="s2">about it just seems to me to be in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.120" end="01:04:25.200" style="s2">confused muddle and people use it in</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.700" end="01:04:26.940" style="s2">such different ways that there really</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:29.130" style="s2">isn&#39;t any value in talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.940" end="01:04:32.490" style="s2">freewill do you have any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.130" end="01:04:34.020" style="s2">that I do yeah and again I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.490" end="01:04:36.300" style="s2">where philosophers have really gone off</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.020" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">the rails they have this kind of I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.300" end="01:04:40.470" style="s2">you remember back in the Victorian times</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:43.200" style="s2">we have this ladder all the species yep</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.470" end="01:04:46.190" style="s2">coming all the way up up to gods and of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.200" end="01:04:49.500" style="s2">course mankind is next to God this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.190" end="01:04:51.180" style="s2">one of those unhelpful things where we</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.500" end="01:04:54.660" style="s2">try to set humans apart from the other</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.180" end="01:04:58.290" style="s2">species I like this idea that we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.660" end="01:04:59.970" style="s2">understand cognitive systems as from a</p>

<p begin="01:04:59.970" end="01:05:07.770" style="s2">down to a single atom that can see a</p>

<p begin="01:05:07.770" end="01:05:12.870" style="s2">and emit the photon again if you like</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.860" end="01:05:15.090" style="s2">passing on the information yep I absorb</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.870" end="01:05:16.770" style="s2">the photon that would be perhaps the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.090" end="01:05:19.380" style="s2">simplest cognitive system you could</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.770" end="01:05:22.500" style="s2">imagine it has both a sensor it can</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.380" end="01:05:24.900" style="s2">receive information it has the memory to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.500" end="01:05:28.380" style="s2">remember that bit of information by this</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.900" end="01:05:31.890" style="s2">energy level changing and it can adapt</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.380" end="01:05:34.410" style="s2">to that that change of information you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.890" end="01:05:38.150" style="s2">can go on scaling that to molecules to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.410" end="01:05:41.550" style="s2">cells to single celled organisms to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.150" end="01:05:44.900" style="s2">multi cell organisms to humans and so on</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.550" end="01:05:48.420" style="s2">and so on that&#39;s up up and up and up and</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.900" end="01:05:52.260" style="s2">with increasing amounts of memory and</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.420" end="01:05:54.020" style="s2">increasing specificity of sensory</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.260" end="01:05:56.580" style="s2">apparatus you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.020" end="01:05:58.910" style="s2">semantically and dynamically scale that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.580" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">process up and end up with a human brain</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.910" end="01:06:06.950" style="s2">and and I wrote a book this year called</p>

<p begin="01:06:09.780" end="01:06:14.580" style="s2">not difficult to write down I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.330" end="01:06:16.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a degree of speculation involved</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.580" end="01:06:19.380" style="s2">obviously but there are bits of evidence</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.980" end="01:06:22.680" style="s2">as well that we can rely on like the</p>

<p begin="01:06:39.869" end="01:06:44.340" style="s2">like us and the sizes of their brains</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.050" end="01:06:47.369" style="s2">and he showed this straight-line</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.340" end="01:06:49.710" style="s2">relationship between the size of the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.369" end="01:06:51.990" style="s2">neocortex or the the reasoning part of</p>

<p begin="01:06:51.990" end="01:06:57.830" style="s2">that animals live in and he showed that</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.330" end="01:07:01.619" style="s2">this the amount of processing capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.830" end="01:07:04.080" style="s2">memory and analysis that goes on inside</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.619" end="01:07:06.030" style="s2">the brain is basically related to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.080" end="01:07:09.570" style="s2">size of the social group that we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.030" end="01:07:11.670" style="s2">to call our friends or to have a to have</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.570" end="01:07:13.500" style="s2">a relationship with and a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.670" end="01:07:15.589" style="s2">is not just yes I friended you on</p>

<p begin="01:07:29.430" end="01:07:33.750" style="s2">trust you no I don&#39;t this takes some</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.260" end="01:07:35.910" style="s2">time to build up and so obviously it</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.750" end="01:07:38.910" style="s2">requires some memory to remember those</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.910" end="01:07:42.390" style="s2">interactions so more memory more socials</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.910" end="01:07:44.369" style="s2">groups more trust and so on and he also</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.390" end="01:07:47.820" style="s2">showed that the depth of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.369" end="01:07:50.960" style="s2">relationship is important so with a</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.820" end="01:07:53.869" style="s2">human brain my brain can manage about</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:56.070" style="s2">the size of a family for a really</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.869" end="01:07:59.099" style="s2">close-knit relationship that I know</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.070" end="01:08:01.410" style="s2">really well but at the level of working</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.099" end="01:08:02.770" style="s2">together we can handle maybe 30 odd</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.410" end="01:08:05.050" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.770" end="01:08:07.270" style="s2">and at the level of sort of sending a</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.270" end="01:08:13.120" style="s2">we can hand up to about 150 people so</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.720" end="01:08:14.980" style="s2">with the same processing capacity we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.120" end="01:08:17.080" style="s2">do different jobs in different amounts</p>

<p begin="01:08:20.710" end="01:08:26.380" style="s2">is an important constraint factor on the</p>

<p begin="01:08:33.490" end="01:08:38.770" style="s2">think if you if you remember at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.279" end="01:08:42.670" style="s2">beginning I said this way of defining</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.670" end="01:08:47.109" style="s2">you get to a certain scale the number of</p>

<p begin="01:08:47.109" end="01:08:52.180" style="s2">because you have learned of the many</p>

<p begin="01:08:58.630" end="01:09:04.060" style="s2">you may have the illusion of free will</p>

<p begin="01:09:18.069" end="01:09:24.609" style="s2">simple model of cognition and memory so</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.870" end="01:09:26.470" style="s2">in other words a cognitive system being</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.609" end="01:09:28.480" style="s2">something that receives inputs through</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.470" end="01:09:31.750" style="s2">some kind of a sensor and has some</p>

<p begin="01:09:31.750" end="01:09:36.520" style="s2">by essentially smart discriminators and</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.089" end="01:09:39.279" style="s2">these smart discriminators are honed by</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.520" end="01:09:41.560" style="s2">evolution over long long timescales so</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.279" end="01:09:44.730" style="s2">vision and movement and place and</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.560" end="01:09:47.700" style="s2">direction even faces apparently have a</p>

<p begin="01:09:47.700" end="01:09:53.980" style="s2">those discriminators can then form a</p>

<p begin="01:10:00.100" end="01:10:04.390" style="s2">senses are switched on it can reason in</p>

<p begin="01:10:07.090" end="01:10:11.440" style="s2">those senses like when we&#39;re asleep</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.940" end="01:10:14.880" style="s2">you&#39;ll see a different kind of a story</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:16.660" style="s2">being told on the brain through dreaming</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.880" end="01:10:20.290" style="s2">which is based on</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.660" end="01:10:23.800" style="s2">same set of memories within the brain or</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.290" end="01:10:25.660" style="s2">within the memory system being pieced</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.800" end="01:10:27.940" style="s2">together with different possible</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.660" end="01:10:30.070" style="s2">outcomes and then of course things go a</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.940" end="01:10:33.280" style="s2">bit haywire because there&#39;s no external</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.070" end="01:10:36.280" style="s2">criteria to set a sense of time so our</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.280" end="01:10:38.710" style="s2">brains use their own sense of time to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.280" end="01:10:43.420" style="s2">piece things together and their own sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.710" end="01:10:46.830" style="s2">of resolution mechanisms like emotional</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.420" end="01:10:49.810" style="s2">resolution to piece together storylines</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.830" end="01:10:52.330" style="s2">and I find this notion of stories to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.810" end="01:10:55.000" style="s2">extremely compelling in these cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.330" end="01:10:58.270" style="s2">systems in around the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.000" end="01:11:00.490" style="s2">consciousness I think that if we ever</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.270" end="01:11:02.110" style="s2">figure out what consciousness is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.490" end="01:11:04.000" style="s2">basically looking at whatever it is in</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.110" end="01:11:06.820" style="s2">the brain that pieces together stories</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.000" end="01:11:08.710" style="s2">in a timeline because even when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.820" end="01:11:10.810" style="s2">asleep we experienced a sense of time</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.710" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">and yet we just have random access</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.810" end="01:11:14.770" style="s2">memories and if you store a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:17.290" style="s2">data in a database in your article</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.770" end="01:11:20.560" style="s2">database you&#39;ll Mongo DD Beta Bates it</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.290" end="01:11:24.250" style="s2">doesn&#39;t suddenly turn into a story or a</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.560" end="01:11:27.910" style="s2">sense of time that has to be constructed</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.250" end="01:11:30.940" style="s2">by some ongoing process extracting</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.910" end="01:11:33.970" style="s2">pieces characters and forcing them into</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.940" end="01:11:37.720" style="s2">a storyline even without external</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.970" end="01:11:39.100" style="s2">sensory stuff going on so in order to</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.720" end="01:11:41.530" style="s2">have this sort of illusion of free will</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.100" end="01:11:42.040" style="s2">and consciousness on these related</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.530" end="01:11:45.280" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.040" end="01:11:47.560" style="s2">I suspect of course this is pure</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.280" end="01:11:50.410" style="s2">speculation but I suspect that these</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.560" end="01:11:52.980" style="s2">things will simply emerge naturally once</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.410" end="01:11:56.170" style="s2">we have a sufficiently large multi scale</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.980" end="01:11:58.720" style="s2">semantic Network which is informed by</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.170" end="01:12:01.210" style="s2">data from the outside but at the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.720" end="01:12:04.630" style="s2">time can reason on the inside through</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.210" end="01:12:07.090" style="s2">these feedback loops and using an</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.630" end="01:12:09.010" style="s2">independent process possibly several if</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.090" end="01:12:11.920" style="s2">you have multiple personality disorder</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.010" end="01:12:13.630" style="s2">right so multiple storylines going on at</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.920" end="01:12:15.730" style="s2">the same time this this could be the way</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.630" end="01:12:17.410" style="s2">that we understand those issues yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.730" end="01:12:18.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what actually if I have a day job</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.410" end="01:12:21.790" style="s2">which I don&#39;t really it is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.820" end="01:12:24.130" style="s2">scientific study of consciousness and my</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.790" end="01:12:26.110" style="s2">own theories would be essentially at</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.130" end="01:12:28.240" style="s2">least partially parallel in that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.110" end="01:12:30.610" style="s2">episodic memories are absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.240" end="01:12:32.590" style="s2">critical and as far as we know there</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.610" end="01:12:35.350" style="s2">our pointers between episodes so there</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.590" end="01:12:37.949" style="s2">is an implicit timeline built into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.350" end="01:12:40.510" style="s2">you know the memory structure of</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.949" end="01:12:41.980" style="s2">reasonably advanced animals we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.510" end="01:12:43.960" style="s2">quite sure where the line is so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.980" end="01:12:44.650" style="s2">interesting I think it&#39;s time to move on</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.960" end="01:12:46.449" style="s2">a little bit here</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.650" end="01:12:49.060" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned you&#39;ve applied promise</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.449" end="01:12:50.380" style="s2">theory to city scaling you know along</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.060" end="01:12:52.960" style="s2">the lines of the work of Lewis</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.380" end="01:12:54.790" style="s2">Betancourt and Jeffery West could you</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.960" end="01:12:58.119" style="s2">say more about that yeah you know I had</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.790" end="01:13:00.010" style="s2">the most amazing coincidence I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.119" end="01:13:02.830" style="s2">in New York for a conference and I met</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.010" end="01:13:04.239" style="s2">Jeff your wife for the first time which</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.830" end="01:13:05.770" style="s2">is amazing because actually we we</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.239" end="01:13:08.260" style="s2">discovered we only have one degree of</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.770" end="01:13:11.230" style="s2">separation between us I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.260" end="01:13:14.080" style="s2">Mark hindmarsh a mutual friend but we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.230" end="01:13:15.489" style="s2">never met and I had no idea what he was</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.080" end="01:13:16.570" style="s2">gonna talk about he had no idea what I</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.489" end="01:13:18.010" style="s2">was gonna talk and you never heard my</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.570" end="01:13:20.710" style="s2">talk because he left early but I</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.010" end="01:13:23.320" style="s2">listened to his talk about cities</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.710" end="01:13:26.320" style="s2">scaling and was just fascinated because</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.320" end="01:13:28.179" style="s2">I realized he was giving almost the same</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.320" end="01:13:31.929" style="s2">talk that I was going to give just on</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.179" end="01:13:34.389" style="s2">with a different focus and I went home</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.929" end="01:13:37.080" style="s2">and I started to download all of his</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.389" end="01:13:39.250" style="s2">papers I spent my Christmas that year</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.080" end="01:13:42.670" style="s2">literally working through all of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.250" end="01:13:45.310" style="s2">papers that he wrote about scaling in</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.670" end="01:13:48.880" style="s2">biological systems and then with Lewis</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.310" end="01:13:53.290" style="s2">Betancourt on scaling in cities and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.880" end="01:13:56.320" style="s2">reproduced Lewis&#39;s model for deriving</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.290" end="01:13:57.550" style="s2">the universal scaling in cities and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.320" end="01:14:00.210" style="s2">I read arrived the whole thing using</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.550" end="01:14:02.980" style="s2">promise theory because I figured that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.210" end="01:14:05.920" style="s2">although these these universal scaling</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.980" end="01:14:09.610" style="s2">stories are nice they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.920" end="01:14:12.369" style="s2">reveal what the mechanisms are in fact</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.610" end="01:14:13.810" style="s2">they somehow actively cover up what</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.369" end="01:14:16.540" style="s2">those mechanisms are and I was</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.810" end="01:14:19.449" style="s2">interested in mechanisms because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.540" end="01:14:20.980" style="s2">more of a hands-on kind of guy I suppose</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.449" end="01:14:23.860" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.980" end="01:14:27.489" style="s2">and I really I mean we stood all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.860" end="01:14:30.420" style="s2">work but just applying the additional</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.489" end="01:14:32.889" style="s2">few bits and pieces there that are in</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.420" end="01:14:36.070" style="s2">promise theory that are not in ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.889" end="01:14:38.860" style="s2">network thinking allowed me to come up</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.070" end="01:14:40.540" style="s2">with a couple of ideas about how might</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.860" end="01:14:41.320" style="s2">this apply to a different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.540" end="01:14:44.409" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.320" end="01:14:46.270" style="s2">rather than a city and again you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.409" end="01:14:48.130" style="s2">thinking of cloud computing because</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.270" end="01:14:51.909" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where I normally work in</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.130" end="01:14:56.380" style="s2">my day job if you will mere mortals like</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.909" end="01:14:58.659" style="s2">myself have no access to the data from</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.380" end="01:15:00.310" style="s2">the big cloud companies right because I</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.659" end="01:15:02.920" style="s2">don&#39;t work for Google and I work for</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.310" end="01:15:03.909" style="s2">Facebook and they don&#39;t share with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.920" end="01:15:06.250" style="s2">other children</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.909" end="01:15:09.429" style="s2">so we don&#39;t have access to that data</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.250" end="01:15:12.310" style="s2">they they have a monopoly on that so I</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.429" end="01:15:14.940" style="s2">began to wonder you know these guys from</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.310" end="01:15:17.500" style="s2">Santa Fe had done an amazing job of</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.940" end="01:15:19.300" style="s2">acquiring data about cities from all of</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.500" end="01:15:21.429" style="s2">these obscure sources and putting</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.300" end="01:15:23.230" style="s2">together a picture and I wondered if</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.429" end="01:15:25.619" style="s2">some of those data might have</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.230" end="01:15:28.389" style="s2">similarities with the kinds of networks</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.619" end="01:15:31.000" style="s2">that you would seen in a computer for</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.389" end="01:15:34.270" style="s2">instance rather than the network&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.000" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">city just by generalizing the argument</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.270" end="01:15:38.710" style="s2">to different kinds and that was good I</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:39.969" style="s2">infer what kind of scaling you might see</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.710" end="01:15:41.980" style="s2">in a computer network and I did</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.969" end="01:15:43.719" style="s2">something around there so I wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.980" end="01:15:46.570" style="s2">paper one that I sent it to Reese and he</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.719" end="01:15:49.449" style="s2">was generous in giving me some comments</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.570" end="01:15:51.460" style="s2">but we were actually both way too busy</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.449" end="01:15:53.050" style="s2">and had to move on to other things I</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.460" end="01:15:56.380" style="s2">don&#39;t think either of us ever ever</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.050" end="01:15:58.300" style="s2">followed up on that stuff I saw he just</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.380" end="01:16:00.730" style="s2">posted a very interesting new paper</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.300" end="01:16:02.650" style="s2">about cities in China which I started to</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.730" end="01:16:04.270" style="s2">read so I&#39;m still interested in that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.650" end="01:16:08.530" style="s2">stuff because I work a little bit on</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.270" end="01:16:10.570" style="s2">smart cities from time to time but there</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.530" end="01:16:12.760" style="s2">are so many interesting cases were again</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.570" end="01:16:15.190" style="s2">multi scale phenomena and network</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.760" end="01:16:16.810" style="s2">science play a role and I think premise</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.190" end="01:16:19.389" style="s2">theory can inform a lot of those</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.810" end="01:16:21.000" style="s2">discussions cool another area you&#39;ve at</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.389" end="01:16:24.130" style="s2">least commented on a little bit is</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.000" end="01:16:26.230" style="s2">applications of promise theory to agile</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.130" end="01:16:28.540" style="s2">both at the group level and at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.230" end="01:16:31.179" style="s2">organizational level what can you tell</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.540" end="01:16:35.530" style="s2">us about promise theory and agile yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.179" end="01:16:37.840" style="s2">again another amazing coincidence our</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.530" end="01:16:41.560" style="s2">apparently mutual friend daniel mezack</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.840" end="01:16:44.020" style="s2">wrote a book called leadership by</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.560" end="01:16:45.849" style="s2">invitation I believe it&#39;s the title in</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.020" end="01:16:49.239" style="s2">which she mentioned premise theory and</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.849" end="01:16:51.030" style="s2">he he let me know that he had mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.239" end="01:16:53.770" style="s2">he&#39;d used promise theory in his book</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.030" end="01:16:55.570" style="s2">inviting leadership by invitation</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.770" end="01:16:57.160" style="s2">so of course I got the book I read it</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.570" end="01:17:00.610" style="s2">and I thought oh this is this is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.160" end="01:17:03.640" style="s2">interesting stuff and I&#39;d always had</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.610" end="01:17:07.480" style="s2">this idea that I wanted to use Primus</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.640" end="01:17:11.380" style="s2">theory at the scale of not just quantum</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.480" end="01:17:16.210" style="s2">mechanics computers organisms biology</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.380" end="01:17:19.210" style="s2">but it&#39;s society and social interactions</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.210" end="01:17:21.880" style="s2">as a potential network as well and of</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.210" end="01:17:24.820" style="s2">course teams and companies and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.880" end="01:17:27.160" style="s2">organizations have some kind of dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.820" end="01:17:28.720" style="s2">of their own and she even Jeffery West</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.160" end="01:17:32.680" style="s2">has done some work on that on a</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.720" end="01:17:37.600" style="s2">different level but I I thought what</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.680" end="01:17:41.200" style="s2">could I do to apply premises directly</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.600" end="01:17:44.830" style="s2">using my algebra of corporation to</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.200" end="01:17:47.170" style="s2">Daniel&#39;s work and heat he&#39;s brought up</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.830" end="01:17:49.420" style="s2">this issue of boundaries where the</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.170" end="01:17:52.690" style="s2">interesting boundaries are in a system</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.420" end="01:17:58.150" style="s2">and how that influences the cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.690" end="01:18:01.810" style="s2">between individuals and companies and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.150" end="01:18:04.660" style="s2">on this is pretty interesting topic on</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.810" end="01:18:08.050" style="s2">all levels you know where is it exactly</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.660" end="01:18:09.700" style="s2">the boundary of a system you think of an</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.050" end="01:18:12.240" style="s2">organism even though you know biological</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.700" end="01:18:14.830" style="s2">organism i we are all shedding cells</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.240" end="01:18:16.450" style="s2">hairs and cells around us every day in</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.830" end="01:18:18.180" style="s2">all the dust in our apartment&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.450" end="01:18:22.630" style="s2">basically bits of us that have fell off</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.180" end="01:18:23.890" style="s2">if I spit on the street is that still</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.630" end="01:18:25.960" style="s2">part of me</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.890" end="01:18:28.630" style="s2">it&#39;s got my DNA right so it&#39;s labeled</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.960" end="01:18:31.150" style="s2">with my the promise of me is in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.630" end="01:18:33.250" style="s2">little lump of spit but it&#39;s it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.150" end="01:18:36.130" style="s2">longer able to feed back on the process</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.250" end="01:18:39.850" style="s2">that I conventionally think of us as me</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.130" end="01:18:41.140" style="s2">so dude do I call it me or not me if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.850" end="01:18:43.030" style="s2">don&#39;t mind I&#39;m gonna jump in here cuz I</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.140" end="01:18:45.550" style="s2">have a keep wrong theory about this it</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.030" end="01:18:47.590" style="s2">comes up all the time on what is me</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.550" end="01:18:49.960" style="s2">right and it goes all the way back to</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.590" end="01:18:52.330" style="s2">conversations in middle school right and</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.960" end="01:18:55.930" style="s2">so what I&#39;ve decided for practical</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.330" end="01:18:59.230" style="s2">purposes is what is me is those sets of</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.930" end="01:19:02.350" style="s2">cells that are actively engaged in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.230" end="01:19:06.160" style="s2">homeostasis network around the transfer</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.350" end="01:19:07.510" style="s2">of gases nutrients and toxins you know I</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.160" end="01:19:09.579" style="s2">think I actually came to</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.510" end="01:19:11.230" style="s2">realization after reading Jeffrey&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.579" end="01:19:13.329" style="s2">on scale and some of his papers on</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.230" end="01:19:14.619" style="s2">Biological scaling because it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.329" end="01:19:16.210" style="s2">me there&#39;s a qualitative difference</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.619" end="01:19:19.630" style="s2">between those cells which are getting</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.210" end="01:19:21.760" style="s2">oxygen and carbon dioxide out nutrients</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.630" end="01:19:24.070" style="s2">in and toxins out on the order of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.760" end="01:19:25.449" style="s2">couple seconds versus those that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.070" end="01:19:27.280" style="s2">and that allows you to make pretty</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.449" end="01:19:29.980" style="s2">strong distinctions for instance our</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.280" end="01:19:32.320" style="s2">fingernails are not me by that theory</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.980" end="01:19:34.059" style="s2">and nor is our hair but the follicles</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.320" end="01:19:36.880" style="s2">for the hair are because they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.059" end="01:19:39.760" style="s2">in this real-time homeostasis around</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.880" end="01:19:41.469" style="s2">gases foods and toxins so I just throw</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.760" end="01:19:44.800" style="s2">that out as at least one way to think</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.469" end="01:19:48.519" style="s2">about what is me I like that and so in</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.800" end="01:19:50.559" style="s2">your view is our the several kilos of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.519" end="01:19:52.929" style="s2">bacteria in our gut part of me or not</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.559" end="01:19:56.289" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.929" end="01:19:58.719" style="s2">their adjacent to me right huh the</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.289" end="01:20:02.019" style="s2">adjacent possible me exactly cuz they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.719" end="01:20:04.539" style="s2">not exactly tied into these homeostasis</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.019" end="01:20:06.369" style="s2">networks but they&#39;re utterly dependent</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.539" end="01:20:08.409" style="s2">upon it well there&#39;s some controversy</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.369" end="01:20:10.809" style="s2">about that as well right they may or may</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.409" end="01:20:12.190" style="s2">not be and tied into those networks in</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.809" end="01:20:14.289" style="s2">ways that were not quite sure man yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.190" end="01:20:16.150" style="s2">but probably indirectly rather than</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.289" end="01:20:19.510" style="s2">directly they&#39;re not literally plugged</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.150" end="01:20:21.159" style="s2">in through capillaries pulling gases in</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.510" end="01:20:22.239" style="s2">and pushing gases out as one level of</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.159" end="01:20:24.369" style="s2">indirection so that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.239" end="01:20:25.989" style="s2">wonderful example that will make me go</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.369" end="01:20:27.909" style="s2">back and rethink my ideas all right well</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.989" end="01:20:31.929" style="s2">let you get back to your discussion</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.909" end="01:20:34.300" style="s2">about agile and Pt ya know I like your</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.929" end="01:20:37.900" style="s2">characterization and the promise idea I</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.300" end="01:20:40.659" style="s2">think feeds very nicely into that way of</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.900" end="01:20:42.820" style="s2">agents interacting in the autonomy of</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.659" end="01:20:45.159" style="s2">the agents in them and where they come</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.820" end="01:20:47.440" style="s2">together and the thing that promise that</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.159" end="01:20:49.329" style="s2">we kind of points out is that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.440" end="01:20:51.730" style="s2">default state of any agent if you will</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.329" end="01:20:53.050" style="s2">is an autonomous state we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.730" end="01:20:56.320" style="s2">free to do whatever we want</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.050" end="01:20:57.909" style="s2">under gathering in the forest but if we</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.320" end="01:21:00.429" style="s2">want to come together in a corporation</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.909" end="01:21:02.739" style="s2">of social cooperation we basically</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.429" end="01:21:05.940" style="s2">voluntarily give up some of that freedom</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.739" end="01:21:08.769" style="s2">by promising to behave in a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.940" end="01:21:11.559" style="s2">promising to deliver which which</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.769" end="01:21:13.300" style="s2">constrains us in a little bit it it</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.559" end="01:21:15.850" style="s2">eliminates a little bit of that that</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.300" end="01:21:19.470" style="s2">freedom to do anything we want</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.850" end="01:21:21.820" style="s2">and so of course we can talk about this</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.470" end="01:21:23.350" style="s2">fascination we have obsession with</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.820" end="01:21:25.750" style="s2">freedom of speech and so on in the West</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.350" end="01:21:28.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a new cost free to say what if</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.750" end="01:21:32.170" style="s2">you won&#39;t we might not be wise but um</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.320" end="01:21:33.930" style="s2">you know just remember the only advice I</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.170" end="01:21:36.730" style="s2">ever got from my my high school teacher</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.930" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">for my university exams was just</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.730" end="01:21:40.930" style="s2">whatever you do don&#39;t tell them to</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.080" end="01:21:46.030" style="s2">off well I violate that what all the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.930" end="01:21:48.340" style="s2">time yeah so yes of course we we limit</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.030" end="01:21:52.570" style="s2">our freedom and we do it by the promises</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.340" end="01:21:54.760" style="s2">we offer one we offer ourselves and with</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.570" end="01:21:58.240" style="s2">this discussion I had with Daniel was to</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.760" end="01:22:00.220" style="s2">apply this to the notions like providing</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.240" end="01:22:03.250" style="s2">services to one another in a business</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.220" end="01:22:06.340" style="s2">what does it mean to have authority over</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.250" end="01:22:08.980" style="s2">others given the agent start up</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.340" end="01:22:11.110" style="s2">basically free and autonomous that turns</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.980" end="01:22:14.050" style="s2">out to be related to a notion of</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.110" end="01:22:16.990" style="s2">symbiosis because you can try to impose</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.050" end="01:22:20.260" style="s2">authority on others by attack if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.990" end="01:22:23.200" style="s2">like by actually trying to overwhelm</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.260" end="01:22:25.620" style="s2">another agent but normally we do it by a</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.200" end="01:22:28.930" style="s2">cooperative means by delegating a</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.620" end="01:22:32.320" style="s2">mandates to cooperate and sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.930" end="01:22:35.500" style="s2">mandate for leadership and accepting</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.320" end="01:22:37.630" style="s2">that man shape that mandate for</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.500" end="01:22:39.430" style="s2">leadership and that goes to the point of</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.630" end="01:22:41.140" style="s2">Rights and whether or not we have rights</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.430" end="01:22:43.870" style="s2">a kind of permission which is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.140" end="01:22:45.310" style="s2">promise to be able to access or to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.870" end="01:22:49.450" style="s2">something that I control and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.310" end="01:22:51.310" style="s2">and there&#39;s even this thing came out of</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.450" end="01:22:53.920" style="s2">it called the downstream principle which</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.310" end="01:22:57.370" style="s2">is who is basically most responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.920" end="01:23:00.490" style="s2">an outcome happening if you have a chain</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.370" end="01:23:02.310" style="s2">of so a service chain or a logistics</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.490" end="01:23:06.550" style="s2">chain if you like an end-to-end delivery</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.310" end="01:23:09.190" style="s2">you can try to blame the saint you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.550" end="01:23:10.660" style="s2">if you order something from Amazon it</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.190" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t arrive on time do you blame</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.660" end="01:23:14.890" style="s2">Amazon do you blame the postman or do</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.360" end="01:23:17.950" style="s2">you blame yourself for not having it on</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.890" end="01:23:21.340" style="s2">time what promise Theory kind of says is</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.950" end="01:23:22.540" style="s2">interesting it says you can blame Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.340" end="01:23:24.970" style="s2">a little bit if you like it&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.540" end="01:23:27.280" style="s2">much juice you can blend the postman a</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.970" end="01:23:28.100" style="s2">little bit more because he&#39;s closer to</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.280" end="01:23:30.290" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.100" end="01:23:32.420" style="s2">but you are the one who ultimately has</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.290" end="01:23:34.700" style="s2">the autonomy to do something about</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.420" end="01:23:36.050" style="s2">getting that book and if it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.700" end="01:23:39.500" style="s2">arrive on time you could go and buy it</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.050" end="01:23:41.330" style="s2">from someone else so you the father</p>

<p begin="01:23:41.330" end="01:23:47.090" style="s2">the recipient of a promise in a chain of</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.620" end="01:23:49.460" style="s2">delegated promises the more</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.090" end="01:23:52.310" style="s2">responsibility you have for the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.460" end="01:23:54.200" style="s2">and that also makes an interesting point</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.310" end="01:23:55.070" style="s2">that if you ultimately try to blame</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.200" end="01:23:56.840" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.070" end="01:23:58.130" style="s2">the only reason for blaming someone else</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.840" end="01:24:01.400" style="s2">is because you didn&#39;t keep your own</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.130" end="01:24:04.610" style="s2">promise to find the source for that</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.400" end="01:24:06.950" style="s2">resolution somewhere else so these these</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.610" end="01:24:10.160" style="s2">ways of applying promises to leadership</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.950" end="01:24:13.130" style="s2">had some pretty interesting insights I</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.160" end="01:24:16.130" style="s2">think in ways of truth-telling if you</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.130" end="01:24:17.540" style="s2">will about organizations and management</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.130" end="01:24:19.910" style="s2">structures I found that quite</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.540" end="01:24:22.040" style="s2">fascinating and I continue to work with</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.910" end="01:24:24.590" style="s2">Daniel on putting together some training</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.040" end="01:24:26.870" style="s2">for people in business let&#39;s make a real</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.590" end="01:24:30.050" style="s2">call out to daniel mezack for being the</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.870" end="01:24:31.970" style="s2">person who nominated mark to be on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.050" end="01:24:33.940" style="s2">show thank you a lot Daniel this has</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.970" end="01:24:36.560" style="s2">been a very productive conversation</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.940" end="01:24:40.040" style="s2">talking about leadership I recorded a</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.560" end="01:24:43.040" style="s2">podcast yesterday with Jamie Weil and he</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.040" end="01:24:45.350" style="s2">is involved with a group called Game B</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.040" end="01:24:48.020" style="s2">which I&#39;m also associated with greater</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.350" end="01:24:51.080" style="s2">or lesser degree which thinks about very</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.020" end="01:24:53.630" style="s2">non-traditional forms of social</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.080" end="01:24:55.940" style="s2">operating systems at all scales from the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.630" end="01:24:57.770" style="s2">small to the large and one of the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.940" end="01:25:00.470" style="s2">he talked about yesterday is one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.770" end="01:25:02.260" style="s2">practiced by the US Navy SEALs the elite</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.470" end="01:25:05.150" style="s2">military in it called dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.260" end="01:25:07.400" style="s2">subordination where there are no leaders</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.150" end="01:25:09.470" style="s2">or their other anomaly leaders being the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.400" end="01:25:12.380" style="s2">Navy people have rank but when the seals</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.470" end="01:25:15.560" style="s2">are out in combat nobody has power based</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.380" end="01:25:18.620" style="s2">on their position it&#39;s a very rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.560" end="01:25:20.660" style="s2">evolving dynamic situation where people</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.620" end="01:25:23.240" style="s2">take role based leadership sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.660" end="01:25:25.640" style="s2">just for seconds and then the team is so</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.240" end="01:25:28.730" style="s2">well coordinated that they transition in</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.640" end="01:25:30.110" style="s2">real time from one role based leader to</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.730" end="01:25:33.050" style="s2">another and they call this whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.110" end="01:25:35.240" style="s2">dynamic subordination any thoughts that</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.050" end="01:25:36.429" style="s2">strike you about that idea I left that</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.240" end="01:25:38.959" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.429" end="01:25:40.459" style="s2">first of all this this idea of game B</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.959" end="01:25:42.019" style="s2">that I learned about this through you</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.459" end="01:25:44.419" style="s2">from you or from your podcast very</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.019" end="01:25:46.669" style="s2">interesting absolutely up my alley</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.419" end="01:25:49.879" style="s2">this idea of role based leadership and</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.669" end="01:25:51.519" style="s2">role based activities in a cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.879" end="01:25:55.219" style="s2">network is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.519" end="01:25:58.099" style="s2">banging armful for promise theory and</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.219" end="01:26:00.619" style="s2">this notion of military voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.099" end="01:26:02.929" style="s2">subordination is one of the examples I</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.619" end="01:26:05.510" style="s2">use again and again in my book because</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.929" end="01:26:07.339" style="s2">you know many people will often object</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.510" end="01:26:11.389" style="s2">to this idea of voluntary cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.339" end="01:26:14.149" style="s2">and what&#39;s on a fundamental sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.389" end="01:26:15.889" style="s2">default state of autonomy and agents by</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.149" end="01:26:17.869" style="s2">saying yeah but that&#39;s not how society</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.889" end="01:26:20.359" style="s2">works you basically tell people what to</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.869" end="01:26:22.719" style="s2">do and that&#39;s what happens and look at</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.359" end="01:26:26.049" style="s2">the military that the most successful</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.719" end="01:26:29.239" style="s2">system in in the world or whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.049" end="01:26:33.159" style="s2">and you point out that of course people</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.239" end="01:26:35.749" style="s2">in the military have a very ordered</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.159" end="01:26:40.609" style="s2">hierarchy of command and control often</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.749" end="01:26:43.579" style="s2">which is designed to maintain a semantic</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.609" end="01:26:46.579" style="s2">stability and an operational stability</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.579" end="01:26:49.249" style="s2">in operational terms but of course the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.579" end="01:26:51.769" style="s2">roles who gets to decide may be changing</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.249" end="01:26:55.399" style="s2">on a basis of whether or not you can</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.769" end="01:26:58.639" style="s2">actually communicate or not so that</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.399" end="01:27:00.469" style="s2">delegated authority and the roles as you</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.639" end="01:27:04.579" style="s2">mentioned is exactly the right analogy</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.469" end="01:27:06.039" style="s2">for a dynamical system and of course</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.579" end="01:27:09.289" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly what happens in biology</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.039" end="01:27:12.260" style="s2">with with different cells taking the</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.289" end="01:27:13.519" style="s2">lead on different processes as certain</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.260" end="01:27:16.129" style="s2">things come in and air to play the</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.519" end="01:27:18.349" style="s2">immune system a great example so that</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.129" end="01:27:22.099" style="s2">most of the time the immune system is</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.349" end="01:27:24.289" style="s2">pretty inert and other systems are in or</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.099" end="01:27:27.439" style="s2">calling the shots but but when an</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.289" end="01:27:30.499" style="s2">antigen is detected that is unpleasant</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.439" end="01:27:32.839" style="s2">or whatever a response will be mounted</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.499" end="01:27:36.049" style="s2">and certain other systems come into play</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.839" end="01:27:37.809" style="s2">taking a lead role on things like heart</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.049" end="01:27:40.280" style="s2">rate and temperature and so on and</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.809" end="01:27:43.280" style="s2">similarly in computer systems multi</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.280" end="01:27:46.519" style="s2">scale systems in computing this notion</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.280" end="01:27:49.730" style="s2">of so-called microservices where</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.519" end="01:27:51.710" style="s2">individual services may be determining</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.730" end="01:27:55.540" style="s2">specific outcomes on our case-by-case</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.710" end="01:28:00.110" style="s2">basis depending on what the particular</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.540" end="01:28:02.630" style="s2">scenario is taking place and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.110" end="01:28:03.830" style="s2">context we&#39;re in I think we had an</p>

<p begin="01:28:03.830" end="01:28:11.420" style="s2">day about biases in data-based decision</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.410" end="01:28:14.390" style="s2">making systems and whether different</p>

<p begin="01:28:22.130" end="01:28:26.930" style="s2">and I I think you and I had this view</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.830" end="01:28:31.940" style="s2">that biases are actually the mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.930" end="01:28:34.910" style="s2">by which we make decisions and in a</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.940" end="01:28:36.739" style="s2">human for instance I&#39;ve always had this</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.910" end="01:28:39.680" style="s2">view that we will never understand the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.739" end="01:28:41.510" style="s2">intelligence or real or artificial</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.680" end="01:28:45.050" style="s2">without understanding me the role that</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.510" end="01:28:47.500" style="s2">emotions play in resolving when things</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.050" end="01:28:52.100" style="s2">are determined or not determined</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.500" end="01:28:54.250" style="s2">basically by a DF of when we have a good</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.100" end="01:28:56.900" style="s2">explanation for something or a proper</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.250" end="01:28:58.910" style="s2">outcome or a proper decision when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.900" end="01:29:00.560" style="s2">happy with that decision it&#39;s whether or</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.910" end="01:29:03.080" style="s2">not our we have an emotional response</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.560" end="01:29:05.210" style="s2">which is favorable or whether we feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.080" end="01:29:08.000" style="s2">like we need to keep going because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.210" end="01:29:10.790" style="s2">fearful and uncertain tell me why you</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.000" end="01:29:13.910" style="s2">know this thing is true like kids tell</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.790" end="01:29:15.530" style="s2">yeah but why daddy why daddy and me well</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.910" end="01:29:17.750" style="s2">it&#39;s because of this no but why is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.530" end="01:29:19.340" style="s2">true oh it&#39;s because of this other thing</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.750" end="01:29:21.020" style="s2">you know but why is that true and</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.340" end="01:29:22.070" style="s2">eventually you give up right you simply</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.020" end="01:29:24.590" style="s2">give up because there&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.070" end="01:29:27.680" style="s2">chain you could go down but you&#39;ll feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.590" end="01:29:29.239" style="s2">either exhausted or or happy to receive</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.680" end="01:29:32.480" style="s2">a particular answer and that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.239" end="01:29:34.510" style="s2">stop that&#39;s your go-to explanation so</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.480" end="01:29:37.850" style="s2">the ultimate resolution of logic is</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.510" end="01:29:40.340" style="s2">emotional and that&#39;s why I think the</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.850" end="01:29:44.390" style="s2">logic will never be the the basis for</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.340" end="01:29:47.600" style="s2">intelligence it&#39;s why without this</p>

<p begin="01:30:10.020" end="01:30:14.460" style="s2">simple question yeah I love it because</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.570" end="01:30:16.170" style="s2">it&#39;s actually something I&#39;m I&#39;m a strong</p>

<p begin="01:30:19.739" end="01:30:24.690" style="s2">two it turns out that emotion is the</p>

<p begin="01:30:24.690" end="01:30:29.310" style="s2">competing models and it&#39;s frankly your</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.460" end="01:30:31.619" style="s2">emotions that tip you to choose a or B</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.310" end="01:30:33.900" style="s2">or C as this well thought out carefully</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.619" end="01:30:35.969" style="s2">articulated thinking we thought but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.900" end="01:30:37.889" style="s2">not really true but point people to one</p>

<p begin="01:30:37.889" end="01:30:42.239" style="s2">people thinking about consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.719" end="01:30:44.159" style="s2">how it relates to the organism the ape</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.239" end="01:30:46.380" style="s2">with clothes that we really are and</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.159" end="01:30:49.409" style="s2">that&#39;s called the feeling of what</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.380" end="01:30:52.080" style="s2">happens body and emotion in the making</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.409" end="01:30:55.020" style="s2">of consciousness by Antonio Damasio</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.219" end="01:31:00.750" style="s2">that&#39;s old but it&#39;s a book that I would</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.590" end="01:31:03.179" style="s2">really point people to who are</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.750" end="01:31:05.219" style="s2">interested in understanding quite deeply</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.179" end="01:31:07.380" style="s2">how the body and emotion are utterly</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.219" end="01:31:09.750" style="s2">involved in our consciousness in every</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.380" end="01:31:11.219" style="s2">single possible way so I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.750" end="01:31:12.150" style="s2">we&#39;re on the same page there let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.219" end="01:31:14.849" style="s2">on a little bit we can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.150" end="01:31:18.449" style="s2">consciousness forever but I list it</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.849" end="01:31:20.849" style="s2">still too long so I want to go turn to</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.449" end="01:31:23.159" style="s2">the next big topic you know some of your</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.849" end="01:31:25.920" style="s2">thinking has returned to your roots and</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.159" end="01:31:27.929" style="s2">physics and you saw an isomorphism more</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.920" end="01:31:30.449" style="s2">or less between promise theory and</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.929" end="01:31:33.389" style="s2">space-time which you developed into</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.449" end="01:31:35.310" style="s2">semantic space-time in fact you wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.389" end="01:31:37.139" style="s2">cool book called smart space-time back a</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.310" end="01:31:38.639" style="s2">quick look at that book convinced me</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.139" end="01:31:41.040" style="s2">that daniel mezack was right this was a</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.639" end="01:31:43.560" style="s2">smart guy we&#39;re talking to tell us about</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.040" end="01:31:44.550" style="s2">smart space-time yes I mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.560" end="01:31:47.940" style="s2">another one of those stories that</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.550" end="01:31:51.270" style="s2">actually came out of that digression</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.940" end="01:31:54.330" style="s2">through cities and networks and over the</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.270" end="01:31:57.449" style="s2">years I&#39;ve discovered that more and more</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.330" end="01:32:01.219" style="s2">of these phenomena that we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.449" end="01:32:05.060" style="s2">the cloud and in cities and and so on</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.219" end="01:32:07.800" style="s2">implicates a reasoning which is based on</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.060" end="01:32:10.710" style="s2">the notion of things being next to one</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.800" end="01:32:13.710" style="s2">another being directly adjacent being</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.710" end="01:32:14.979" style="s2">able to communicate or being in sequence</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.710" end="01:32:18.130" style="s2">to one another</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.979" end="01:32:20.469" style="s2">in time where time is in fact just</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.130" end="01:32:22.059" style="s2">changes that happen basically it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.469" end="01:32:26.050" style="s2">these the sequence of changes that</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.059" end="01:32:30.070" style="s2">happen is what we mean by a clock in you</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.050" end="01:32:33.400" style="s2">nine Stein&#39;s meaning and and so this</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.070" end="01:32:38.079" style="s2">idea of space and time was always in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.400" end="01:32:40.869" style="s2">back of my mind as being conspicuously</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.079" end="01:32:43.570" style="s2">present in many of these explanations of</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.869" end="01:32:46.959" style="s2">an abstract way and being a physicist I</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.570" end="01:32:49.209" style="s2">recognize these things we are taught to</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.959" end="01:32:52.989" style="s2">think about space and time these days in</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.209" end="01:32:55.300" style="s2">terms of symmetry so in physics symmetry</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.989" end="01:32:57.670" style="s2">plays a large role and we talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.300" end="01:33:00.280" style="s2">symmetry of translations or linear</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.670" end="01:33:02.619" style="s2">motion and the symmetry of rotations</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.280" end="01:33:05.079" style="s2">about different axes like the earth</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.619" end="01:33:07.389" style="s2">turning on its axis if you you know you</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.079" end="01:33:09.340" style="s2">rotate it it looks the same like a ball</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.389" end="01:33:12.340" style="s2">then we said that&#39;s a symmetry of</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.340" end="01:33:14.229" style="s2">rotation if you move something and you</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.340" end="01:33:15.729" style="s2">can&#39;t really see that it&#39;s moved because</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.229" end="01:33:17.469" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to compare it to you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.729" end="01:33:20.289" style="s2">say that&#39;s the symmetry of translation</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.469" end="01:33:22.269" style="s2">and and the whole of modern physics is</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.289" end="01:33:25.479" style="s2">based on this notion is shift in</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.269" end="01:33:29.110" style="s2">thinking towards symmetry in space and</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.479" end="01:33:31.869" style="s2">time but what I realized in these</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.110" end="01:33:35.349" style="s2">discrete networks that I deal with every</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.869" end="01:33:39.610" style="s2">day in computer science is that that</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.349" end="01:33:43.570" style="s2">idea is not gonna fly in computer</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.610" end="01:33:45.579" style="s2">science first of all because at the</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.570" end="01:33:49.360" style="s2">scale of the networks we have there is</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.579" end="01:33:50.949" style="s2">no large-scale order what we call</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.360" end="01:33:54.909" style="s2">long-range order in physics there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.949" end="01:33:57.099" style="s2">large-scale translational invariance in</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.909" end="01:33:59.559" style="s2">other words on a long long scale you</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.099" end="01:34:02.349" style="s2">don&#39;t see any uniformity things are</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.559" end="01:34:03.670" style="s2">pretty muddled up and messy still but as</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.349" end="01:34:06.840" style="s2">the cloud gets bigger and bigger and</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.670" end="01:34:10.630" style="s2">bigger we eventually find these virtual</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.840" end="01:34:13.479" style="s2">forms of uniformity so you can move a</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.630" end="01:34:14.949" style="s2">virtual machine from one physical</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.479" end="01:34:16.539" style="s2">machine to another and you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.949" end="01:34:19.719" style="s2">the difference that&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.539" end="01:34:23.219" style="s2">translation invariance in the cloud can</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.719" end="01:34:26.040" style="s2">reorganize or we connect to different</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.219" end="01:34:29.280" style="s2">servers we were just talking about</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.040" end="01:34:31.860" style="s2">eventual consistency you could flip your</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.280" end="01:34:34.680" style="s2">server from Asia to America for instance</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.860" end="01:34:36.330" style="s2">and and you would not see any difference</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.680" end="01:34:38.940" style="s2">and that would be a kind of rotational</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.330" end="01:34:42.660" style="s2">invariance so there these analogs</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.940" end="01:34:45.330" style="s2">between these in variances or covariance</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.660" end="01:34:47.340" style="s2">is that we see in physics and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.330" end="01:34:50.220" style="s2">changes that we can apply in computer</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.340" end="01:34:51.690" style="s2">science and I wondered every one might</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.220" end="01:34:54.990" style="s2">be possible to formalize some of that</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.690" end="01:34:57.000" style="s2">using promise theory so I I said about</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.990" end="01:34:59.130" style="s2">doing this I sat down with my little pen</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.000" end="01:35:01.680" style="s2">and paper and I hate literally do work</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.130" end="01:35:05.550" style="s2">with a fountain pen in a moleskin book</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.680" end="01:35:09.240" style="s2">when I do my work and I I started trying</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.550" end="01:35:13.200" style="s2">to rediscover space-time by using the</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.240" end="01:35:15.750" style="s2">networks and premise theory thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.200" end="01:35:18.450" style="s2">the points in space as individual agents</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.750" end="01:35:20.130" style="s2">and the connections between them being</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.450" end="01:35:23.070" style="s2">based on the promises that they make it</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.130" end="01:35:25.050" style="s2">one another and this connected</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.070" end="01:35:27.480" style="s2">immediately with Shannon&#39;s notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.050" end="01:35:30.090" style="s2">communications channel sender and</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.480" end="01:35:33.180" style="s2">receiver which only takes you halfway</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.090" end="01:35:35.060" style="s2">from A to B and this was already</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.180" end="01:35:37.620" style="s2">extremely interesting to me because</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.060" end="01:35:40.110" style="s2">again in physics we have this notion</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.620" end="01:35:43.500" style="s2">that if a is next to B then obviously B</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.110" end="01:35:46.050" style="s2">is next to a but in information theory</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.500" end="01:35:48.540" style="s2">and in Kronus theory that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.050" end="01:35:51.330" style="s2">to be true there&#39;s an additional promise</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.540" end="01:35:54.120" style="s2">that needs to happen in order to get</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.330" end="01:35:56.730" style="s2">back again if you got for me to be to go</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.120" end="01:36:00.360" style="s2">back from B to a so that the natural</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.730" end="01:36:02.550" style="s2">most primitive state of a space-time if</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.360" end="01:36:04.920" style="s2">you will of in other words of points</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.550" end="01:36:08.850" style="s2">being next to one another in a network</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.920" end="01:36:11.160" style="s2">is for them to be in a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.850" end="01:36:15.960" style="s2">directed graph what we call a directed</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.160" end="01:36:19.260" style="s2">Network in in math and to reconstruct</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.960" end="01:36:21.390" style="s2">everything that we known on take for</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.260" end="01:36:23.550" style="s2">granted in physics using a promise</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.390" end="01:36:25.740" style="s2">theoretic network takes actually a lot</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.550" end="01:36:27.930" style="s2">of work it takes a lot a lot of promises</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.740" end="01:36:30.360" style="s2">that we take simply for granted in</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.930" end="01:36:31.680" style="s2">physics and that is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.360" end="01:36:33.150" style="s2">because it means that there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.680" end="01:36:34.230" style="s2">bunch of things that we ignore in</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.150" end="01:36:35.240" style="s2">physics that we should be paying</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.230" end="01:36:39.690" style="s2">attention to</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.240" end="01:36:40.070" style="s2">now imagine like a leap of faith if you</p>

<p begin="01:37:57.830" end="01:38:01.880" style="s2">which I found extremely interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.200" end="01:38:05.240" style="s2">I tried to write a little bit about in</p>

<p begin="01:38:05.240" end="01:38:13.640" style="s2">at the opposite end of that I read that</p>

<p begin="01:38:28.310" end="01:38:33.470" style="s2">absolutely fascinating to go from them</p>

<p begin="01:39:14.340" end="01:39:18.150" style="s2">that on their website and if you feel</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.140" end="01:39:20.250" style="s2">the same kind of congruence that I do</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.150" end="01:39:21.840" style="s2">I&#39;d be happy to introduce you to the</p>

<p begin="01:39:21.840" end="01:39:25.860" style="s2">guys would have something very</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.800" end="01:39:27.630" style="s2">interesting to talk about I&#39;ll send you</p>

<p begin="01:39:42.210" end="01:39:46.140" style="s2">books I&#39;m gonna do a little bit more</p>

<p begin="01:39:53.670" end="01:39:58.320" style="s2">you&#39;re willing I&#39;d like to get you back</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.290" end="01:40:00.450" style="s2">on again and talk about money sure but</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.320" end="01:40:03.930" style="s2">let&#39;s switch to a couple other smaller</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.450" end="01:40:05.880" style="s2">topics one that listeners of the Jim rut</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.930" end="01:40:07.950" style="s2">show know is a regular recurring feature</p>

<p begin="01:40:07.950" end="01:40:13.920" style="s2">with my guests is talking about the</p>

<p begin="01:40:13.920" end="01:40:18.630" style="s2">where the hell are all the space aliens</p>

<p begin="01:40:20.640" end="01:40:25.140" style="s2">the top gate was willing to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.870" end="01:40:28.170" style="s2">so mark what do you think about space</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.140" end="01:40:30.060" style="s2">aliens this is I love this topic and I</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.170" end="01:40:32.340" style="s2">first thought about this because Isaac</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.060" end="01:40:34.440" style="s2">Asimov got me interested in this his</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.340" end="01:40:36.840" style="s2">book extraterrestrial civilization so I</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.440" end="01:40:39.030" style="s2">this is a book I got as a teenager so</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.840" end="01:40:41.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve had this topic on my mind for for</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.030" end="01:40:43.130" style="s2">years and years but I thought about it</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.160" end="01:40:47.700" style="s2">again recently because I wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.130" end="01:40:50.940" style="s2">artificial intelligence in a blog post</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.700" end="01:40:52.950" style="s2">on my network on my home page rather and</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.940" end="01:40:55.890" style="s2">I forget the name of the of the blog</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.950" end="01:40:57.330" style="s2">post but it was basically about scale</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.890" end="01:41:01.730" style="s2">again you know my favorite topic of</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.330" end="01:41:04.000" style="s2">scale time scales and spacial scales and</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.730" end="01:41:05.780" style="s2">the point I wanted to make was that</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.000" end="01:41:07.970" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been reading all these</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.780" end="01:41:10.520" style="s2">books about the you know the a is are</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.970" end="01:41:12.860" style="s2">gonna take over they&#39;re gonna read all</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.520" end="01:41:15.260" style="s2">our stuff and become evil and steal our</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.860" end="01:41:17.090" style="s2">money and run away with civilization and</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.260" end="01:41:19.610" style="s2">try to kill us and I thought hang on</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.090" end="01:41:22.070" style="s2">hang on a second how do we even know</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.610" end="01:41:24.830" style="s2">that a life form whether it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.070" end="01:41:28.550" style="s2">life form in outer space or or an</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.830" end="01:41:31.940" style="s2">artificial life form as an AI would have</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.550" end="01:41:34.490" style="s2">any sensory apparatus that responds on</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.940" end="01:41:37.340" style="s2">the same time scale that we do how would</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.490" end="01:41:40.010" style="s2">we know that it&#39;s processes are in any</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.340" end="01:41:41.450" style="s2">way comparable to ours in order to</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.010" end="01:41:46.010" style="s2">notice that we even exist</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.450" end="01:41:48.290" style="s2">and the obvious example of that is the</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.010" end="01:41:52.550" style="s2">case I just gave of the hidden life of</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.290" end="01:41:55.310" style="s2">trees Petzval Leben&#39;s book in which we</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.550" end="01:41:58.190" style="s2">look at a forest and this is a set of</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.310" end="01:42:01.340" style="s2">life-forms that are thinking reasoning</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.190" end="01:42:04.790" style="s2">changing adapting on a timescale that is</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.340" end="01:42:06.560" style="s2">so much longer than ours that we</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.790" end="01:42:09.170" style="s2">literally can&#39;t see any of it happening</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.560" end="01:42:11.900" style="s2">it looks totally frozen in time to us</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.170" end="01:42:15.350" style="s2">and yet there is this living changing</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.900" end="01:42:18.440" style="s2">dynamical Network happening over years</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.350" end="01:42:21.500" style="s2">millennia centuries possibly even</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.440" end="01:42:23.090" style="s2">millennia involving organisms and all</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.500" end="01:42:28.190" style="s2">kinds of scales and you could make the</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.090" end="01:42:32.990" style="s2">same accusation of AI how do you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.190" end="01:42:35.210" style="s2">that the data an AI if it evolved got</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.990" end="01:42:37.520" style="s2">interested in and the sensors that it</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.210" end="01:42:39.650" style="s2">was connected to explicitly or</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.520" end="01:42:41.150" style="s2">implicitly that might lead to an</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.650" end="01:42:44.560" style="s2">emergent intelligence how did you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.150" end="01:42:47.540" style="s2">that those would be related to our</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.560" end="01:42:49.610" style="s2">scales the scales on which we are</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.540" end="01:42:51.080" style="s2">interested in things and Howard its</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.610" end="01:42:53.870" style="s2">understanding of the world essentially</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.080" end="01:42:56.990" style="s2">overlap with ours I think that may be</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.870" end="01:43:00.950" style="s2">the key to why we are unable to perceive</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.990" end="01:43:02.810" style="s2">or see not only life but dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.950" end="01:43:05.390" style="s2">phenomena in the universe because we are</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.810" end="01:43:06.750" style="s2">simply ill-equipped on a sensory level</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.390" end="01:43:09.270" style="s2">or in a reasoning</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.750" end="01:43:11.690" style="s2">to think about them in the same time</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.270" end="01:43:14.460" style="s2">scale a spatial scan for that matter</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.690" end="01:43:16.320" style="s2">course that leaves two possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.460" end="01:43:18.600" style="s2">which both of which could be true things</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.320" end="01:43:20.370" style="s2">that are way faster than we can perceive</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.600" end="01:43:23.250" style="s2">I suppose there is something like life</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.370" end="01:43:24.990" style="s2">somehow in the corona of the Sun with</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.250" end="01:43:27.000" style="s2">this tremendous energy flux going</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.990" end="01:43:29.250" style="s2">through it it may be operating at</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.000" end="01:43:30.990" style="s2">quantum mechanical time speeds right and</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.250" end="01:43:33.390" style="s2">on the other extreme I&#39;ll take your</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.990" end="01:43:36.570" style="s2">example of trees and fungus networks and</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.390" end="01:43:38.400" style="s2">scale it up to something interface life</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.570" end="01:43:42.660" style="s2">that lives in interstellar space and</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.400" end="01:43:44.130" style="s2">reacts on the million year time frame we</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.660" end="01:43:46.440" style="s2">would miss both of those does that make</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.130" end="01:43:47.910" style="s2">sense yeah I mean we know the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.440" end="01:43:49.770" style="s2">the first one because we saw that in</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.910" end="01:43:52.800" style="s2">Star Trek if they if they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.770" end="01:43:56.970" style="s2">really fast they sound like bees you may</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.800" end="01:43:59.310" style="s2">remember that episode one of them</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.970" end="01:44:01.320" style="s2">goddamned later ones I&#39;m only the first</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.310" end="01:44:03.510" style="s2">generation Star Trek man I do not watch</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.320" end="01:44:05.040" style="s2">the later ones that would know this dude</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.510" end="01:44:06.960" style="s2">this was Captain Kirk he fell in love</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.040" end="01:44:11.190" style="s2">with that be on the end of this I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.960" end="01:44:14.790" style="s2">and try and dig out that name yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.190" end="01:44:17.100" style="s2">the second one definitely interesting in</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.790" end="01:44:19.560" style="s2">my book actually also make the point</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.100" end="01:44:22.350" style="s2">that if you observe phenomena of a long</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.560" end="01:44:24.750" style="s2">long times you may actually extract a</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.350" end="01:44:26.430" style="s2">kind of a space-time picture that looks</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.750" end="01:44:28.970" style="s2">a little bit like Newtonian mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.430" end="01:44:32.220" style="s2">with things like velocities and</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.970" end="01:44:33.480" style="s2">accelerations and masses explained in</p>
