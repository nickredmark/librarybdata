<p begin="00:01:47.689" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">neuro hacking pretty much means applied</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">neuroscience how can we work with</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">various technologies and modalities to</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.629" end="00:03:02.609" style="s2">Daniel I&#39;m glad that you summarized it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.879" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">so succinctly but you just covered the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.609" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">entire field of mind science in about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:10.049" style="s2">two sentences I think it&#39;s amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:12.269" style="s2">you were able to do that but I like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.049" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">idea of technology agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.269" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">because you&#39;re saying let&#39;s be inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:21.900" style="s2">let&#39;s not get all of our ducks in one</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:23.579" style="s2">row let&#39;s think about these in a from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.900" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">complexity point of view and you and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.579" end="00:03:27.859" style="s2">had an opportunity to speak about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">earlier and I think that whole thing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.859" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">complexity systems if you could talk a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:34.709" style="s2">little bit about that and how pulling</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:37.340" style="s2">these disparate ideas together might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.709" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">constructive</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.340" end="00:03:43.829" style="s2">yeah when the field of psycho norm</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">ecology started complex system science</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.829" end="00:03:47.549" style="s2">was not well developed wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:49.349" style="s2">developed at all and so our best</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.549" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">scientific methodology was still</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.349" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">variable isolation reductionism so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">looking specifically to try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:58.109" style="s2">understand what dopamine does or what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">particular molecule that affects some</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.109" end="00:04:02.370" style="s2">part of you the dopamine system a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:04.109" style="s2">presynaptic dopamine agonist or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.370" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">dopamine receptor modulator you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.109" end="00:04:08.430" style="s2">some some particular part of it what</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:11.340" style="s2">that does but that means we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.430" end="00:04:13.349" style="s2">understand one part in isolation of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.340" end="00:04:14.790" style="s2">rest of the whole and to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.349" end="00:04:16.139" style="s2">clinical trials on that appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of averaging everything else</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.139" end="00:04:21.269" style="s2">together and then we see do we get some</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:24.210" style="s2">kind of statistical lift beyond placebo</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.269" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">and if we do then that seems interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.210" end="00:04:28.130" style="s2">even though that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">bell curve has people getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.130" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">significantly different experiences on</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:33.780" style="s2">opposite ends the bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:35.640" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously attributable to other</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.780" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">things right the way that one variables</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.640" end="00:04:39.690" style="s2">interfacing with the rest of the system</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:42.390" style="s2">and so complex system science allows us</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.690" end="00:04:43.950" style="s2">to look at a lot more variables a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.390" end="00:04:46.110" style="s2">more complexly and look at their</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.950" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">interactions and their synergies synergy</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.110" end="00:04:50.430" style="s2">defined as the behavior of whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:52.290" style="s2">that is unpredicted by the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.430" end="00:04:54.510" style="s2">the parts taken separately in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.290" end="00:04:56.250" style="s2">and so one of the problems when we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.510" end="00:04:58.280" style="s2">trying to isolate variables is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.250" end="00:05:02.550" style="s2">synergies between variables get missed</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.280" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">and this is why and the way we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.550" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">practiced medicine we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:09.750" style="s2">gastroenterology neurology oncology etc</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:11.610" style="s2">all the diseases that start in one</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.750" end="00:05:13.170" style="s2">system and move to another system right</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.610" end="00:05:15.000" style="s2">issues that start in the gut caused</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.170" end="00:05:16.890" style="s2">mucosal barrier dysfunction and end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.000" end="00:05:18.540" style="s2">causing neurologic issues because</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.890" end="00:05:21.240" style="s2">they&#39;re between systems we end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.540" end="00:05:23.880" style="s2">missing so much of the pathology of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.240" end="00:05:26.250" style="s2">passo etiology and what we find is also</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.880" end="00:05:27.960" style="s2">in radically complex systems everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.250" end="00:05:31.590" style="s2">to various degrees intersects everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.960" end="00:05:33.630" style="s2">else so we need to study that that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.590" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">causal interactions much more complexly</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.630" end="00:05:38.520" style="s2">we also get causal recursion where one</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:40.169" style="s2">thing can affect another variable but</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.520" end="00:05:41.940" style="s2">then that variable can in turn come back</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.169" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">and riaf echt that variable both either</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.940" end="00:05:49.440" style="s2">in a regulatory capacity or with</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:51.590" style="s2">positive feedback loops and so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:54.270" style="s2">when we look at the success of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.590" end="00:05:57.960" style="s2">psychiatric medicine for all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.270" end="00:06:00.090" style="s2">psych diseases currently compared to</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:44.520" style="s2">and then we also start to see that not</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.900" end="00:06:46.710" style="s2">only are there a lot of variables that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.520" end="00:06:47.970" style="s2">are involved but they&#39;re different sets</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.710" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">of variables for different people and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.970" end="00:06:50.820" style="s2">this is where we start to get towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:52.980" style="s2">personalized medicine and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.820" end="00:06:56.010" style="s2">personalized psychology psychiatry and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.980" end="00:06:59.730" style="s2">personalized development so say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.010" end="00:07:02.970" style="s2">looking at anxiety or autism or</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.730" end="00:07:04.910" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s and we&#39;re looking at all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.970" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">things that we know causally are</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.910" end="00:07:08.280" style="s2">associated right or at least all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:12.030" style="s2">things where we have a some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.280" end="00:07:13.530" style="s2">correlation and so we&#39;ll find maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.030" end="00:07:15.420" style="s2">heavy metals are actually statistically</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.530" end="00:07:16.650" style="s2">meaningfully correlated with this</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.420" end="00:07:19.320" style="s2">particular kind of neurodegenerative</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.330" end="00:07:27.720" style="s2">organophosphates VOCs maybe microbial</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.970" end="00:07:42.660" style="s2">these things are correlated but not one</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.200" end="00:07:44.670" style="s2">for one which means they statistically</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.660" end="00:07:46.470" style="s2">correlate there probably have a causal</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.670" end="00:07:50.270" style="s2">influence sometimes but not all the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.470" end="00:07:53.190" style="s2">because that represents one pathway of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.270" end="00:07:56.940" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis that can lead</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.190" end="00:07:59.790" style="s2">to pathophysiology that can lead to some</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.940" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">set of symptomology occurring and when</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.790" end="00:08:03.690" style="s2">we talk about anxiety or Alzheimer&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:07.010" style="s2">any kind of disease what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.690" end="00:08:09.960" style="s2">about is some similar kinds of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.010" end="00:08:11.700" style="s2">from some similar kinds of tissues but</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.960" end="00:08:12.690" style="s2">the underlying pathologist can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.700" end="00:08:14.340" style="s2">different that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.690" end="00:08:16.290" style="s2">succeeded in really being able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.340" end="00:08:19.740" style="s2">address them and so you need to develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.290" end="00:08:21.930" style="s2">an underlying causal landscape a causal</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.740" end="00:08:25.230" style="s2">ontology of all the things that could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.930" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">associated it could be causal how to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.230" end="00:08:29.250" style="s2">differential diagnosis across all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">those and then how to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.250" end="00:08:33.210" style="s2">understand different therapies in terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">of the underlying mechanisms that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.210" end="00:08:38.460" style="s2">involved and then what is the weighted</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:40.710" style="s2">subset of that whole causal landscape</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.460" end="00:08:43.169" style="s2">that&#39;s going on for this person and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.710" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">what what therapies what synergy of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.169" end="00:08:46.380" style="s2">therapies and in what order of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:49.100" style="s2">operations are going to be ideal to them</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.380" end="00:08:51.510" style="s2">and this is where we move towards real</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.100" end="00:08:52.960" style="s2">personalized medicine personalized</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.510" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">psychotherapy and then be</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.960" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">on the baseline of wellness personalized</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:00.850" style="s2">enhancement and development that gets to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:02.440" style="s2">synthesize the best of everything that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.850" end="00:09:05.320" style="s2">we know today</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.440" end="00:09:07.630" style="s2">you know while you&#39;re talking you say</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.320" end="00:09:09.850" style="s2">it&#39;s so exceedingly well I&#39;m pardon me</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.630" end="00:09:12.190" style="s2">for being effusive with you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.850" end="00:09:14.740" style="s2">but it&#39;s just so interesting to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.190" end="00:09:16.300" style="s2">talk because it&#39;s what so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.740" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">struggle with every day it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.300" end="00:09:19.450" style="s2">matter whether you&#39;re a purely</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:21.690" style="s2">traditional psyche or whether you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.450" end="00:09:24.400" style="s2">patient coming into a psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.690" end="00:09:25.650" style="s2">everybody&#39;s looking for the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.400" end="00:09:28.330" style="s2">really in their mind they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.650" end="00:09:31.210" style="s2">complexity but they don&#39;t have a vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.330" end="00:09:33.430" style="s2">a road a path to consider and wrap their</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.210" end="00:09:34.990" style="s2">arms around complexity and there may</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.430" end="00:09:36.220" style="s2">additional thing where the complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.990" end="00:09:38.230" style="s2">not only the variables that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.220" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">speaking about but is the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.230" end="00:09:43.720" style="s2">time as time comes in to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:46.390" style="s2">situation because so much of function is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.720" end="00:09:48.670" style="s2">time related and so much of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.390" end="00:09:50.410" style="s2">dealing with is not time related it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.670" end="00:09:55.000" style="s2">fine that label to be that way to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.410" end="00:09:57.340" style="s2">next hundred years yeah we also have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.000" end="00:10:00.250" style="s2">when there were at the time we have all</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.340" end="00:10:02.830" style="s2">of the conditions that have very delayed</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.250" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">causation delayed onset and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.830" end="00:10:06.670" style="s2">something that always makes diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:09.730" style="s2">tricky is if something has a rapid onset</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.670" end="00:10:11.110" style="s2">following a pretty clear cause it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.730" end="00:10:14.410" style="s2">little bit easier to treat but if</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.110" end="00:10:16.150" style="s2">something has either a rapid onset but</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.410" end="00:10:17.620" style="s2">not following any clear cause or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.150" end="00:10:21.370" style="s2">the clear cause that it followed was</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.620" end="00:10:22.920" style="s2">simply a last trigger of a whole causal</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.370" end="00:10:25.800" style="s2">chain that moved it in the symptomology</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.920" end="00:10:29.770" style="s2">then it&#39;s very easy to miss attribute it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.800" end="00:10:31.480" style="s2">and so we need to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.770" end="00:10:33.340" style="s2">diagnosis thinking about things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.480" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">might have happened a long time ago but</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.340" end="00:10:40.780" style="s2">not resulted in some Tamala G and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">as we as we&#39;re treating of course here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.780" end="00:10:47.740" style="s2">one of the things I would say is very</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:50.830" style="s2">deep to our goals is we have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.740" end="00:10:52.570" style="s2">internal regulatory system right this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.830" end="00:10:54.130" style="s2">endogenous regulatory system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.570" end="00:10:55.540" style="s2">not one regulatory system but you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.130" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">think of all the different regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.540" end="00:11:01.530" style="s2">axes as a comprehensive regulatory or</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:04.300" style="s2">cybernetic system and we&#39;re regulating</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.530" end="00:11:06.520" style="s2">pH and redox interactions and glucose</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.300" end="00:11:06.790" style="s2">and you know transmitters you know all</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.520" end="00:11:10.690" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.790" end="00:11:15.400" style="s2">within specific ranges so if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.690" end="00:11:18.610" style="s2">dopamine is really low and I just give</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.400" end="00:11:21.280" style="s2">them a in chain dopamine that agonist</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.610" end="00:11:23.260" style="s2">without asking why was it low was it low</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.280" end="00:11:25.270" style="s2">because they aren&#39;t eating enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.260" end="00:11:27.010" style="s2">protein that contains the amino acid</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.270" end="00:11:29.410" style="s2">precursors is it because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.010" end="00:11:30.730" style="s2">digest the protein because of a issue in</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.410" end="00:11:31.930" style="s2">their stomach they can&#39;t absorb it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.730" end="00:11:34.630" style="s2">because of an issue and their intestines</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.930" end="00:11:37.030" style="s2">can they not convert those amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.630" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">can they not convert the tyrosine into</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.030" end="00:11:42.340" style="s2">l-dopa into dopamine are there enzyme</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:46.090" style="s2">deficiencies are there so if I go</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.340" end="00:11:49.750" style="s2">straight to giving the in chain agonist</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.090" end="00:11:51.490" style="s2">and of course whatever else was affected</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.750" end="00:11:53.500" style="s2">downstream I&#39;m not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.490" end="00:11:55.030" style="s2">supporting right and say it was say it</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.500" end="00:11:56.500" style="s2">was a tyrosine mechanism well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.030" end="00:11:59.700" style="s2">also affecting their thyroid or it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.500" end="00:12:01.810" style="s2">also affecting so many other systems and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.700" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">I&#39;m going to get some side effects</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.810" end="00:12:06.310" style="s2">because now I&#39;m creating a fixed level</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:08.200" style="s2">of that chemical independent of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.310" end="00:12:10.900" style="s2">body&#39;s real-time regulation of it which</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.200" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">is gonna throw out the balance with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.900" end="00:12:14.770" style="s2">you know literally trillions of other</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.360" end="00:12:16.510" style="s2">chemicals that it should be interacting</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.770" end="00:12:20.140" style="s2">with with more complexity than that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.510" end="00:12:21.970" style="s2">I&#39;m creating exogenous dependence right</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.140" end="00:12:23.740" style="s2">so rather than the body being able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.970" end="00:12:26.460" style="s2">self-regulate it&#39;s depending on external</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.740" end="00:12:31.240" style="s2">regulation and so now there&#39;s ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.460" end="00:12:33.840" style="s2">dependence our goal is that any good</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.240" end="00:12:35.830" style="s2">system of medicine and good system of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.840" end="00:12:38.440" style="s2">psychiatry and good system of biohacking</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.830" end="00:12:40.660" style="s2">neuro hacking should be supporting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.440" end="00:12:44.620" style="s2">endogenous regulatory systems to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.660" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">increased regulatory capacity and we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.620" end="00:12:48.340" style="s2">really define health as the robustness</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:52.900" style="s2">and resilience of the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.340" end="00:12:55.980" style="s2">capacity of the entire system and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.900" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">we can think about aging actually as</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.980" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">decreased homeostatic resilience on some</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.960" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">lead to pathophysiology so then our goal</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.080" end="00:13:16.750" style="s2">really becomes in preventing illness in</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.339" end="00:13:31.310" style="s2">of the entire set of regulatory systems</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.620" end="00:13:46.760" style="s2">the complexity of your thinking is so</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.959" end="00:13:48.500" style="s2">fascinating but I said something there</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.760" end="00:13:50.450" style="s2">just at the very close that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.500" end="00:13:52.940" style="s2">jump on because what you&#39;re really</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.940" end="00:13:57.320" style="s2">wrong is that we&#39;re really dealing when</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.779" end="00:14:04.490" style="s2">have a single answer so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.269" end="00:14:06.920" style="s2">things that happens is people come a guy</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.490" end="00:14:10.490" style="s2">like me and they say you know I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.920" end="00:14:11.959" style="s2">this problem well how come I have to do</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:19.610" style="s2">because there are so many things can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.140" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">you just give me one thing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.610" end="00:14:23.720" style="s2">I&#39;m a very primitive level of this</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.720" end="00:14:29.089" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s an interesting issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.120" end="00:14:31.910" style="s2">to address with our our audience because</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.089" end="00:14:33.589" style="s2">that&#39;s a frequent problem for our</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.910" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">audience how do we actually deal with</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.589" end="00:14:39.110" style="s2">the complexity on a street level right I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:43.570" style="s2">would say the Silver Bullet mentality is</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.110" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">a broken mentality in every area every</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.190" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">the answer to getting buff or</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.850" end="00:15:05.000" style="s2">psychologically well or anything it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">always requires any kind of development</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.000" end="00:15:12.199" style="s2">of any system requires continuous varied</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.199" end="00:15:18.500" style="s2">acting on systems and so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.649" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">minimum and it&#39;s acting on on all</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.500" end="00:15:22.699" style="s2">systems right you have oxidative stress</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:25.070" style="s2">on cells you have excitotoxin stress you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.699" end="00:15:28.760" style="s2">have mutation that&#39;s occurring you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.070" end="00:15:30.230" style="s2">got and so it&#39;s you&#39;ve got entropy</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.760" end="00:15:33.410" style="s2">occurring on all these systems you need</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.230" end="00:15:36.140" style="s2">to be putting in at least as much energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.410" end="00:15:38.300" style="s2">and by energy here I don&#39;t mean glucose</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.140" end="00:15:40.730" style="s2">and Jaime putting in at least as much of</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.730" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">eroding and to just even keep up right</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">and just like anyone knows that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:52.340" style="s2">someone works out for ten years</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">gets buff as can be the moment they stop</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.340" end="00:15:59.090" style="s2">working out they start losing it and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:01.520" style="s2">is entropies it&#39;s just kind of universal</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.090" end="00:16:06.020" style="s2">recycling process of that which is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.520" end="00:16:07.580" style="s2">no longer useful right and so then it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.020" end="00:16:10.910" style="s2">starts moving those parts to be used for</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.580" end="00:16:13.820" style="s2">something else so any kind of health any</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.910" end="00:16:15.710" style="s2">kind of resilience requires continuous</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.820" end="00:16:19.250" style="s2">input and the appropriate kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.710" end="00:16:21.800" style="s2">continuous input so we know that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.250" end="00:16:23.300" style="s2">are so many different minerals depending</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.800" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">upon which list you read of how many are</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.300" end="00:16:28.520" style="s2">essential at 72 or 84 or 92 right but</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:30.350" style="s2">there&#39;s so many minerals that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.520" end="00:16:32.180" style="s2">essential for health there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.350" end="00:16:34.820" style="s2">vitamins so many phytonutrients so many</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.180" end="00:16:37.100" style="s2">macronutrients and even a deficiency of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.820" end="00:16:40.370" style="s2">one of them can lead to a debilitating</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.100" end="00:16:41.960" style="s2">disease right just D being low leading</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.370" end="00:16:46.030" style="s2">the rickets or C being well leading the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.960" end="00:16:52.700" style="s2">scurvy or b1 leading a beriberi and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.030" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">Liam if we want to not see it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.700" end="00:16:55.940" style="s2">them being low enough that they go into</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:16:57.890" style="s2">acute pathology it&#39;s also the sub</p>

<p begin="00:17:01.520" end="00:17:06.290" style="s2">about nutrients in but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.110" end="00:17:09.500" style="s2">talking about input that supports detox</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.290" end="00:17:11.740" style="s2">and input that supports antioxidant</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.710" end="00:17:21.110" style="s2">support system regulation so yes I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.690" end="00:17:26.960" style="s2">say that anyone who wants to be really</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.110" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">healthy and vital and optimized has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.960" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">take full responsibility for what that</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:34.580" style="s2">means and not expect that there&#39;s a very</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.580" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">solution and just embrace that as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.700" end="00:17:45.140" style="s2">the physics of universe I mean that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:46.820" style="s2">so absolutely true I mean that is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.140" end="00:17:47.090" style="s2">we deal with either we&#39;re going to deal</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.090" end="00:17:51.710" style="s2">complexity now and and some of us may be</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.880" end="00:17:54.260" style="s2">interested in how do we package the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.710" end="00:17:55.940" style="s2">complexity because ya do have to</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.940" end="00:18:00.919" style="s2">just go out and shotgun the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:05.210" style="s2">because that absolutely won&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.919" end="00:18:08.390" style="s2">has to honor the integrity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.210" end="00:18:10.820" style="s2">in some constructive way and even though</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.390" end="00:18:14.029" style="s2">there there is a complexity involved</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.210" end="00:18:31.490" style="s2">doing with the podcast here is offering</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:15.179" style="s2">mechanics in terms of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.950" end="00:20:17.790" style="s2">genetics and fundamental space of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.179" end="00:20:21.990" style="s2">person and then be able to synthesize</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.990" end="00:20:25.410" style="s2">have known efficacy for sleep and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.730" end="00:20:27.420" style="s2">relate them to underlying mechanics or</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.410" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">anxiety or whatever it is and then be</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.420" end="00:20:31.050" style="s2">able to say these ones are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">most effective for this person at this</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.050" end="00:20:36.330" style="s2">time you know highest probability so</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:38.160" style="s2">this is N equals one optimization the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.330" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">clinical trial can&#39;t do that right it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.160" end="00:20:44.280" style="s2">can only say there is some lift with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:45.450" style="s2">bell curve compared to placebo even</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.280" end="00:20:46.710" style="s2">though the people on one in the bell</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.450" end="00:20:48.780" style="s2">curve and the other having totally</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.710" end="00:20:50.610" style="s2">different experiences when you try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.780" end="00:20:53.370" style="s2">put everybody on the front of the bell</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.610" end="00:20:56.160" style="s2">curve now we&#39;re not saying okay I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.370" end="00:20:57.870" style="s2">this device or supplements or meditation</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.160" end="00:20:59.610" style="s2">technology or whatever I&#39;m going to give</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.870" end="00:21:01.320" style="s2">it to ruin because I have a hammer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.610" end="00:21:04.140" style="s2">gonna saying that everything is a nail</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.320" end="00:21:05.820" style="s2">right and we can say you have anxiety so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.140" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">take a Benz or you have anxiety so do</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.820" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">this breathing technique or meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:11.870" style="s2">technique and it might help some but if</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:14.429" style="s2">the person&#39;s anxiety is related to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.870" end="00:21:16.050" style="s2">parasitic brain access disorder none</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.429" end="00:21:18.660" style="s2">either those solutions are gonna fix it</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.050" end="00:21:20.790" style="s2">and if it&#39;s related to a head trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.660" end="00:21:22.290" style="s2">there&#39;s some actual neural circuitry to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.790" end="00:21:23.220" style="s2">address none of those are gonna fix it</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.290" end="00:21:24.600" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.220" end="00:21:26.040" style="s2">things that could fix it and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.600" end="00:21:27.510" style="s2">mean that they wouldn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.040" end="00:21:29.220" style="s2">differently if we know how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.510" end="00:21:31.980" style="s2">right assessments and then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.220" end="00:21:33.240" style="s2">direct people to you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.980" end="00:21:34.670" style="s2">highest probability of greatest success</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.240" end="00:21:37.800" style="s2">for them which is actually now not that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.670" end="00:21:39.390" style="s2">complicated but it draws on all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.800" end="00:21:45.300" style="s2">complexity of everything we know both</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.390" end="00:21:47.160" style="s2">about psychology physiology the mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.300" end="00:21:50.309" style="s2">brain interface and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.160" end="00:21:53.880" style="s2">diagnostic and therapeutic modalities so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.309" end="00:21:57.480" style="s2">it has a simultaneous activity of ruling</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.880" end="00:22:02.550" style="s2">out and ruling in so it&#39;s not just yep</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.480" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">ruling out Frank its ruling in and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.550" end="00:22:07.830" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very interesting point</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:11.040" style="s2">because that takes us over to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.830" end="00:22:13.090" style="s2">affirmative prospect of how does this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.040" end="00:22:16.600" style="s2">thing actually work effective</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.090" end="00:22:18.510" style="s2">as opposed to here&#39;s what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.600" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">here&#39;s how we can see this pathology</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.510" end="00:22:25.030" style="s2">okay this is this is a sick broken</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:27.880" style="s2">system you&#39;re saying well that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.030" end="00:22:30.370" style="s2">only above the picture and if we get</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.880" end="00:22:34.299" style="s2">lost over there which I think in truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.370" end="00:22:37.330" style="s2">many of us are then we&#39;re arrested we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.299" end="00:22:39.540" style="s2">developmentally arrested we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.330" end="00:22:41.530" style="s2">of great insights right in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.540" end="00:22:43.059" style="s2">integrative medicine and functional</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.530" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">medicine I think have been doing a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.059" end="00:22:46.330" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:48.580" style="s2">aggressively of trying to see how do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.330" end="00:22:50.140" style="s2">factor more systems so we&#39;re gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.580" end="00:22:52.030" style="s2">at the gastroenterology and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.140" end="00:22:54.340" style="s2">neurology and the oncology and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.030" end="00:22:56.040" style="s2">Rheumatology together right and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.340" end="00:22:58.510" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna look at the various</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.040" end="00:22:59.710" style="s2">intercostal worlds together the genomics</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.510" end="00:23:01.570" style="s2">and the microbiome X and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.710" end="00:23:03.370" style="s2">transcriptomics and the proteomics and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.570" end="00:23:05.110" style="s2">the you know that way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.370" end="00:23:07.720" style="s2">body and we&#39;re gonna look at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.110" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">different kinds of deviations from</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.720" end="00:23:13.510" style="s2">homeostasis toxins nutrient deficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:15.370" style="s2">genetic disorders infections right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.510" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">how do we work with those and try and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.370" end="00:23:18.549" style="s2">make some sense out of this and so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.010" style="s2">can see various people who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.549" end="00:23:22.600" style="s2">at the cutting edge in those spaces</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.010" end="00:23:25.900" style="s2">doing a better job of synthesizing more</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.600" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">things now synthesizing and aggregating</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.900" end="00:23:28.929" style="s2">are different right aggregating is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:30.130" style="s2">shotgun approach which just says all</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.929" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">right well all these have some</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.130" end="00:23:34.330" style="s2">effectiveness let&#39;s kind of try all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:37.419" style="s2">them synthesis is well these ones are</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.330" end="00:23:39.190" style="s2">effective for for these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.419" end="00:23:41.049" style="s2">mechanisms not just these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:43.750" style="s2">insane conditions they can have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.049" end="00:23:45.490" style="s2">mechanisms leading into them so how do</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.750" end="00:23:48.580" style="s2">we do the differential diagnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.490" end="00:23:51.010" style="s2">know what to do then for that person and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.580" end="00:23:54.010" style="s2">how do we do right order of operations</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.010" end="00:23:57.040" style="s2">right so if it&#39;s functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.010" end="00:23:59.230" style="s2">gets into quite a lot when you need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.040" end="00:24:02.919" style="s2">treat a gut barrier disorder before</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.230" end="00:24:03.970" style="s2">trying to address blood toxicity issues</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.919" end="00:24:05.260" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re gonna can or</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.970" end="00:24:08.169" style="s2">Rheumatology because you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.260" end="00:24:10.360" style="s2">keep having inflammation from from tight</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.169" end="00:24:12.340" style="s2">Junction issues whatever so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.360" end="00:24:15.700" style="s2">they&#39;re doing a very good job but</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.340" end="00:24:16.929" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it like you go to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.700" end="00:24:17.919" style="s2">conference and you look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.929" end="00:24:20.410" style="s2">cutting-edge research that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.919" end="00:24:24.549" style="s2">in various fields it&#39;s more than any</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.410" end="00:24:25.720" style="s2">human can actually synthesize and when</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.549" end="00:24:26.650" style="s2">you look at all the medical journals</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.720" end="00:24:28.330" style="s2">that are coming out</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.650" end="00:24:29.920" style="s2">actually good underlying mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.330" end="00:24:31.390" style="s2">insights it&#39;s again more than any human</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.920" end="00:24:36.730" style="s2">can synthesize which is why it takes</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.390" end="00:24:39.070" style="s2">this kind of AI platform methodology to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.730" end="00:24:40.600" style="s2">be able to vet and synthesize at scale</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.070" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">and then make all of human knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.600" end="00:24:47.530" style="s2">available to individual practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">and individual people so I was like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.530" end="00:24:56.500" style="s2">Wikipedia of the mind some constructive</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:59.860" style="s2">way yes yes AI is artificial</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.500" end="00:25:01.420" style="s2">intelligence yes just to say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.860" end="00:25:04.590" style="s2">because I know some of our listeners may</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.420" end="00:25:04.590" style="s2">wonder what AI is though</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.830" end="00:25:10.750" style="s2">so then the next question after that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.620" end="00:25:12.970" style="s2">do you you are developing a system then</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.750" end="00:25:16.450" style="s2">you&#39;re developing ways of doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.970" end="00:25:20.800" style="s2">you&#39;re codifying and how you know is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.450" end="00:25:23.380" style="s2">this going to happen in a computer model</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.800" end="00:25:25.510" style="s2">of some kind is it going to be it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.380" end="00:25:27.520" style="s2">like you&#39;re going in that direction that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.510" end="00:25:31.900" style="s2">when you feed the material in and you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.520" end="00:25:34.330" style="s2">a certain and number of tests then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.900" end="00:25:36.460" style="s2">can feed it in and pop something out</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.330" end="00:25:40.540" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be more easily</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.460" end="00:25:44.830" style="s2">accessible than then just plain thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.540" end="00:25:50.220" style="s2">it through yeah definitely so you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.830" end="00:25:52.960" style="s2">see that we already have labs that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.220" end="00:25:56.590" style="s2">automate some of the suggestions based</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.960" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">on kind of standard protocols from what</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.590" end="00:26:02.140" style="s2">they see in the lab so you get the lab</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">back and you have depending upon say</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.140" end="00:26:09.640" style="s2">your doing them you know gut barrier</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:11.530" style="s2">assessment then based on what&#39;s showing</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.640" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">up in the lab you&#39;ll see some generated</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.530" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">pages of common best practices you also</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:18.910" style="s2">already have systems of electronic</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:20.650" style="s2">medical records that start putting some</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.910" end="00:26:23.170" style="s2">pieces of the data together start giving</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.650" end="00:26:24.340" style="s2">you some analytics so that&#39;s the trend</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.170" end="00:26:28.530" style="s2">in that direction those are just</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.340" end="00:26:32.680" style="s2">relatively low intelligence systems and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.530" end="00:26:35.320" style="s2">so what what is interesting is as we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.680" end="00:26:39.210" style="s2">start harvesting a lot more biometric</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.320" end="00:26:40.630" style="s2">data then it becomes less and less</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.210" end="00:26:43.540" style="s2">understandable by an</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.630" end="00:26:46.060" style="s2">vidual person in real time so if we</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.540" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">start doing whole genome sequences and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.060" end="00:26:51.670" style="s2">want to look at the whole genome right</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:54.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot it&#39;s and then it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.670" end="00:26:56.590" style="s2">looking at individuals snips right</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.010" end="00:26:59.080" style="s2">individual genes and their polymorphisms</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.590" end="00:27:02.050" style="s2">it&#39;s looking at the combinatorics on</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.080" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">that and now that scales very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.050" end="00:27:06.580" style="s2">and then that still doesn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:09.340" style="s2">about gene expression and so then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.580" end="00:27:12.660" style="s2">looking at clinical chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.340" end="00:27:17.650" style="s2">metabolomics transcriptomics etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.660" end="00:27:19.960" style="s2">but all we can understand the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.650" end="00:27:22.060" style="s2">mechanisms that are happening and we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.960" end="00:27:25.240" style="s2">build systems to be able to model this</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.060" end="00:27:27.220" style="s2">better and do a better job of making</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.240" end="00:27:30.700" style="s2">more sense of more different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.220" end="00:27:34.840" style="s2">data in a synthesized fashion so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.700" end="00:27:35.770" style="s2">the goal I mean how can you say hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.840" end="00:27:38.950" style="s2">that in one breath</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.770" end="00:27:41.080" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s so interesting you know so</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.950" end="00:27:43.000" style="s2">then how are you actually breaking that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.080" end="00:27:45.160" style="s2">down in neuro hacker I mean I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.000" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">to ask for any proprietary but just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.160" end="00:27:52.510" style="s2">little bit of an idea because it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.230" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">so very large to the questions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.510" end="00:27:58.390" style="s2">raising or so enormous in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:02.860" style="s2">practical how does one do that to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.390" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">it yeah well if you go to you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.860" end="00:28:05.680" style="s2">hacker comm right now you won&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.210" end="00:28:09.460" style="s2">anything about anything we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.680" end="00:28:12.970" style="s2">about you will see a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.460" end="00:28:17.430" style="s2">information on complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.970" end="00:28:20.020" style="s2">applied to neuroscience and you will see</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.430" end="00:28:22.930" style="s2">some cognitive enhancement supplements</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.020" end="00:28:24.100" style="s2">for sale so we&#39;re a relatively new</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.930" end="00:28:25.810" style="s2">organization and so we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.100" end="00:28:30.090" style="s2">somewhere like every organization needs</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.810" end="00:28:32.800" style="s2">to and for us well we knew the goal was</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.090" end="00:28:34.420" style="s2">C I&#39;m talking about diagnostic methods</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.800" end="00:28:36.490" style="s2">here but let&#39;s look at the therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.420" end="00:28:39.850" style="s2">side for a moment and you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.490" end="00:28:41.530" style="s2">disease model side which is you know how</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.850" end="00:28:43.540" style="s2">do we get people back to wellness from</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.530" end="00:28:45.850" style="s2">some diagnosed disease but then you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.540" end="00:28:47.170" style="s2">the enhancement side and so neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.850" end="00:28:48.130" style="s2">has started in terms of its forward</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.170" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">facing offerings on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.130" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">direct-to-consumer enhancement side</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.200" end="00:28:57.029" style="s2">and if you think of neural hacking kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.320" end="00:29:00.120" style="s2">of as a subset of biohacking that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.029" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">specifically focused and and that just</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.120" end="00:29:06.570" style="s2">means applied technologies for personal</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:09.740" style="s2">enhancement but we&#39;re specifically</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.570" end="00:29:13.460" style="s2">focused on the mind brain space so</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.740" end="00:29:16.649" style="s2">enhancing cognitive and enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.460" end="00:29:22.350" style="s2">emotional and psychological both</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.649" end="00:29:23.700" style="s2">well-being and capability there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.350" end="00:29:26.730" style="s2">of different technologies that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.700" end="00:29:28.649" style="s2">effective as we were mentioning you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.730" end="00:29:31.110" style="s2">so we were looking at whether we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.649" end="00:29:31.860" style="s2">to develop better systems of EEG</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.110" end="00:29:34.470" style="s2">neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.860" end="00:29:38.669" style="s2">or better systems of transcranial lasers</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.470" end="00:29:41.730" style="s2">for up regulating neuronal ATP or better</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.669" end="00:29:46.110" style="s2">systems of computer-based psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.730" end="00:29:48.389" style="s2">or that can you know work on a widely</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.110" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">through a platform or the better kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.389" end="00:29:52.649" style="s2">better kinds of neural chemical</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.580" end="00:29:53.880" style="s2">solutions and they&#39;re all very</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.649" end="00:29:55.139" style="s2">meaningful and they&#39;re differently</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.880" end="00:29:57.990" style="s2">meaningful for different kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.139" end="00:30:00.029" style="s2">and so our goal is to synthesize to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.990" end="00:30:03.269" style="s2">able to have a space where if someone</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.029" end="00:30:05.250" style="s2">had a goal no matter what the goal was</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.269" end="00:30:08.100" style="s2">in the psychoneurosis and no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.250" end="00:30:11.100" style="s2">the underlying physiology they had going</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.100" end="00:30:13.860" style="s2">on there could be a best synthesized</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.100" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">resource for them and so we started in</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.860" end="00:30:18.539" style="s2">the know tropic space of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">enhancement because we work in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.539" end="00:30:23.610" style="s2">space deeply and we knew that we could</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">do very potent of life enhancing things</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.610" end="00:30:30.809" style="s2">for people that were not currently</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:32.429" style="s2">available on the market and we could do</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.809" end="00:30:36.269" style="s2">that easier than we could build this AI</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.429" end="00:30:38.779" style="s2">system and so this was a and then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.269" end="00:30:41.149" style="s2">know from there a whole line of</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.779" end="00:30:45.149" style="s2">direct-to-consumer biochemistry so</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.149" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">specific kinds of nutraceuticals that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.149" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t see on the market anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:50.429" style="s2">because we&#39;re working with this complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:52.350" style="s2">systems framework of not trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.429" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">alright we&#39;re we have a sleep mode and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.350" end="00:30:56.220" style="s2">we&#39;re working with gaba or melatonin or</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">you know but what are all the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.220" end="00:31:00.620" style="s2">that are involved and how do we up</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:04.289" style="s2">regulate the endogenous circuitry and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.620" end="00:31:05.549" style="s2">obviously to do this at full scale we</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.289" end="00:31:06.120" style="s2">need to be able to do it in a customized</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.549" end="00:31:07.559" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.120" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s what requires this underlying</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.559" end="00:31:11.789" style="s2">system so we&#39;re starting with not</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:14.340" style="s2">customized but center of the bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.789" end="00:31:15.929" style="s2">very effective for most people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.340" end="00:31:19.470" style="s2">that&#39;s what we currently have then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.929" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">moving into phenotype specific so before</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.470" end="00:31:24.360" style="s2">it&#39;s fully personalized we find that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:26.400" style="s2">there are handfuls of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.360" end="00:31:27.870" style="s2">neurochemical phenotypes so like in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.400" end="00:31:29.100" style="s2">Walsh work you&#39;ve looked at under and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.870" end="00:31:33.539" style="s2">over meth later is a different</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.100" end="00:31:35.190" style="s2">underlying structure right under an over</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.539" end="00:31:38.429" style="s2">catecholamine urja under an over</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.190" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">cholinergic CNS stimulation so we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.429" end="00:31:42.809" style="s2">get more affective just through those</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:46.590" style="s2">kind of categories and then move into</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.809" end="00:31:53.820" style="s2">full customization but it&#39;s also of all</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.590" end="00:31:56.760" style="s2">the things one could do how likely is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.820" end="00:31:59.870" style="s2">vagal nerve stimulator versus a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.760" end="00:32:02.580" style="s2">transcranial stimulator versus this</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.870" end="00:32:05.100" style="s2">breathing technique versus these</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.580" end="00:32:07.799" style="s2">biochemical gaba Eric&#39;s going to be most</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.100" end="00:32:09.990" style="s2">useful for them even at that level so we</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.799" end="00:32:11.610" style="s2">started building technologies in each of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.990" end="00:32:14.010" style="s2">these categories some are in market</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.610" end="00:32:16.289" style="s2">already some are still in R&amp;D and over</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.010" end="00:32:18.360" style="s2">the next year a lot will be going coming</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.289" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">to market and this allows us to be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.360" end="00:32:24.539" style="s2">to grow our research team and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">continue development and the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.539" end="00:32:29.820" style="s2">platform we&#39;re working on but you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:34.710" style="s2">that that has some years before its</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.820" end="00:32:35.940" style="s2">meaning meaningfully applicable well the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.710" end="00:32:38.100" style="s2">issue is because you&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.940" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">have you&#39;re really in kind of a data</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.100" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">acquisition mode from what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:46.590" style="s2">you&#39;re you you know generally what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.399" end="00:32:49.500" style="s2">problem is but then you&#39;re codifying and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:51.299" style="s2">breaking it down and doing some serious</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.500" end="00:32:56.510" style="s2">data acquisition because then you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.299" end="00:33:00.899" style="s2">push the button and have some configure</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.510" end="00:33:04.260" style="s2">so yeah we are as far as that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.899" end="00:33:05.970" style="s2">acquisition goes not mostly in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.260" end="00:33:10.820" style="s2">feedback from current things we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.970" end="00:33:14.520" style="s2">that&#39;s useful this is why we do trials</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.820" end="00:33:17.800" style="s2">but it is doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.520" end="00:33:20.020" style="s2">doing structured reviews of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.800" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">fields to know where the current state</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.020" end="00:33:24.040" style="s2">of the art is of the entire field if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:26.110" style="s2">synthesize all the knowledge which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.040" end="00:33:28.380" style="s2">something that is not for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.110" end="00:33:32.800" style="s2">reason commonly done or well done and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.380" end="00:33:34.930" style="s2">then being able to see what should our</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.930" end="00:33:40.210" style="s2">particular space be once we already have</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.470" end="00:33:42.760" style="s2">looked at everything that is known in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.210" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">that space and what we can abstract from</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.760" end="00:33:50.580" style="s2">all those partial insights together and</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.580" end="00:33:55.960" style="s2">connectomics if you&#39;re doing that in you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.920" end="00:33:59.620" style="s2">know neurogenesis if you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.960" end="00:34:03.370" style="s2">in genomics it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.620" end="00:34:05.140" style="s2">know takes work yeah yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.370" end="00:34:07.930" style="s2">deep it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna cost I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.140" end="00:34:10.980" style="s2">to do that to actually pull the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.930" end="00:34:13.480" style="s2">laboratory data together it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.980" end="00:34:16.330" style="s2">you have some interested people and some</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.480" end="00:34:18.940" style="s2">well trained people and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.330" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">thinking along the same path who have</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.940" end="00:34:26.140" style="s2">the same delightfully curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:27.880" style="s2">objectives that you have it could happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.140" end="00:34:30.790" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s just the question of putting</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.880" end="00:34:32.679" style="s2">putting kind of a forgive the grandiose</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.790" end="00:34:34.630" style="s2">expression kind of a new world order of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.679" end="00:34:39.159" style="s2">how do we how do we codify Dada how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.630" end="00:34:42.280" style="s2">we pull it together yeah and the poet</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.159" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">together is the key part because machine</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.280" end="00:34:45.669" style="s2">learning assessing big data is already</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:51.909" style="s2">there and there&#39;s a number of systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.669" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">doing that but when the interactions are</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.909" end="00:34:56.950" style="s2">as complex as these ones are even</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:34:59.070" style="s2">tremendous amounts of computation don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.950" end="00:35:01.570" style="s2">give us all the insights just via</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.070" end="00:35:04.750" style="s2">computational brute force you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.570" end="00:35:07.170" style="s2">actually develop models you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.750" end="00:35:09.580" style="s2">develop underlying ontology of how this</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.170" end="00:35:13.750" style="s2">complex human regulatory system works</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.580" end="00:35:18.700" style="s2">and then be able to utilize those models</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.750" end="00:35:21.220" style="s2">as ways of interpreting the data and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.700" end="00:35:23.950" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.220" end="00:35:26.500" style="s2">of uniquely focused on sounds so</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.950" end="00:35:27.850" style="s2">interesting so when you go over to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.500" end="00:35:29.470" style="s2">website we have some</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.850" end="00:35:33.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen them you have some great</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.470" end="00:35:36.250" style="s2">videos that break down some of this I</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.420" end="00:35:37.960" style="s2">mean it&#39;s been a while since I was over</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.250" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">there you&#39;re looking like maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.960" end="00:35:41.080" style="s2">trying to think of which video was that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2">it seemed to me there was a video that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.080" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">saw is like oh my gosh this I had a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:49.990" style="s2">interesting interesting moment and I am</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:51.910" style="s2">I miss remembering that I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.990" end="00:35:53.830" style="s2">some videos on the site currently I</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.910" end="00:35:57.270" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we have any speaking</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.830" end="00:35:59.230" style="s2">about the future of say Diagnostics or</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.270" end="00:36:02.770" style="s2">interpretation like this but we do have</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.230" end="00:36:05.860" style="s2">ones that are discussing why a system</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.770" end="00:36:08.820" style="s2">heights approach is needed and then some</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.860" end="00:36:12.280" style="s2">of how we came up with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.820" end="00:36:15.810" style="s2">cognitive enhancement chemistry from a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.280" end="00:36:19.030" style="s2">systems theoretic perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.810" end="00:36:20.710" style="s2">because it&#39;s not only useful for</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.030" end="00:36:25.180" style="s2">interpreting diagnostic that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.710" end="00:36:26.970" style="s2">useful building technologies that work</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.180" end="00:36:28.840" style="s2">across multiple mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.970" end="00:36:31.240" style="s2">simultaneously and one understand the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.840" end="00:36:32.440" style="s2">synergy of those mechanisms so when</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.240" end="00:36:34.690" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about enhancing people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.440" end="00:36:37.230" style="s2">cognitive capability are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.690" end="00:36:39.940" style="s2">about modifying acetylcholine or</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.230" end="00:36:42.850" style="s2">glutamate or dopamine or other</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.940" end="00:36:45.190" style="s2">catecholamines or ion channels or</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.850" end="00:36:46.570" style="s2">changing the phospholipid membranes or</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.190" end="00:36:51.100" style="s2">we&#39;re probably talking about all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.570" end="00:36:54.300" style="s2">those things right and so and then with</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.100" end="00:36:58.270" style="s2">acetylcholine that are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.300" end="00:37:00.220" style="s2">changing how it gets across the synapse</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.270" end="00:37:02.470" style="s2">are we talking about changing how it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.220" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">up taken and the postsynaptic receptor</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.470" end="00:37:08.530" style="s2">or we and so what we did in that space</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:11.260" style="s2">because there are so many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.530" end="00:37:15.910" style="s2">not using adderall via prescription but</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.260" end="00:37:18.040" style="s2">off-label adderall and other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.910" end="00:37:20.260" style="s2">what you call smart drugs for their</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.040" end="00:37:22.180" style="s2">midterms their finals their tech startup</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.260" end="00:37:26.740" style="s2">where it really does have meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.180" end="00:37:30.370" style="s2">side-effects and and even you know Red</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.740" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">Bull and multiple doses of 300</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.370" end="00:37:36.220" style="s2">milligrams of caffeine with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:37.630" style="s2">important to get that both something</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.220" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">like adderall and both something like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.630" end="00:37:41.710" style="s2">the energy drinks will enhance a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:44.050" style="s2">element</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.710" end="00:37:45.940" style="s2">of productivity and focus while</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.050" end="00:37:47.770" style="s2">decreasing statistically known to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.940" end="00:37:50.859" style="s2">decrease other key elements of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.770" end="00:37:54.460" style="s2">capability plus producing dependents</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.859" end="00:37:57.070" style="s2">plus producing side-effects and so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.460" end="00:38:01.720" style="s2">wanted to see can we support people in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.070" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">their desire to be more clear and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.720" end="00:38:05.980" style="s2">productive and capable in the presence</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:09.310" style="s2">of ever increasing attention</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.980" end="00:38:13.510" style="s2">distractions in ways that are more</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.310" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">effective and not harmful and so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.510" end="00:38:17.410" style="s2">that required us looking at well when</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:18.430" style="s2">people are really seeking cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.410" end="00:38:21.060" style="s2">enhancement what are they looking for</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.430" end="00:38:22.990" style="s2">and they&#39;re not just looking for focus</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.060" end="00:38:25.300" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.990" end="00:38:27.609" style="s2">focus and short-term memory and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.300" end="00:38:30.670" style="s2">long-term memory and speed of memory and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.609" end="00:38:33.670" style="s2">specific memory and digit span and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.670" end="00:38:35.730" style="s2">verbal fluency and emotional things that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.670" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">come along with it like emotional Raziel</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.730" end="00:38:41.560" style="s2">and Adams connection to drive and so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:42.970" style="s2">kind of from a cognitive science point</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.560" end="00:38:45.460" style="s2">of view modeled what is everything that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.970" end="00:38:47.290" style="s2">people look for there and then we looked</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.460" end="00:38:49.240" style="s2">at what is everything known about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.290" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">underlying physiologic pathway is known</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.240" end="00:38:52.390" style="s2">to correlate with each of those</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:56.260" style="s2">subjective States and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.390" end="00:38:58.930" style="s2">capabilities then there&#39;s chemistry that</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.260" end="00:39:01.210" style="s2">affects all of those pathways and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.930" end="00:39:03.609" style="s2">start our design process from there so</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.210" end="00:39:06.130" style="s2">that&#39;s you know a systems theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.609" end="00:39:08.589" style="s2">perspective works both on may slide</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.130" end="00:39:13.930" style="s2">design science and they interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.589" end="00:39:18.180" style="s2">Diagnostics in both of those worlds so</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.930" end="00:39:18.180" style="s2">the question then is a guy who practices</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.450" end="00:39:26.859" style="s2">sort of proprietary question but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.170" end="00:39:29.500" style="s2">curious because I use testing and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.859" end="00:39:32.619" style="s2">wonder how a person like you or your</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.500" end="00:39:35.530" style="s2">team decides which group you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.619" end="00:39:39.990" style="s2">use for the tests that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.530" end="00:39:39.990" style="s2">acquire so that it could have a more</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.349" end="00:39:47.640" style="s2">diffused body position so that so that a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.099" end="00:39:51.490" style="s2">number of people can use it effectively</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.640" end="00:39:52.869" style="s2">how do you actually decide what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.490" end="00:39:54.830" style="s2">laboratory is going to be or which</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.869" end="00:39:59.330" style="s2">laboratories to use how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.830" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">yeah so as far as laboratory testing</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.330" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">goes I have to make my FDA disclaimer</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:05.410" style="s2">statement right now we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:09.410" style="s2">the future of medicine and psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.410" end="00:40:10.700" style="s2">just abstractly but as far as neuro</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.410" end="00:40:12.220" style="s2">hacker goes we don&#39;t have anything to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.700" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">say about medicine or psychiatry because</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.220" end="00:40:18.920" style="s2">we can&#39;t say anything about that and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:20.890" style="s2">aren&#39;t prescribing labs and etc so we</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.920" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">just tell people to go to a doctor and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.890" end="00:40:27.500" style="s2">get those done but as far as research in</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:29.690" style="s2">that space coast how do we determine how</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.500" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">would I determine what I think is a good</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.690" end="00:40:32.750" style="s2">laboratory test or not well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:35.660" style="s2">few things first we have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.750" end="00:40:37.370" style="s2">sensitivity and specificity</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.660" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">how many false negatives how many false</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.370" end="00:40:42.320" style="s2">positives do we have from that lab by</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:45.890" style="s2">comparing it to other known best of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.320" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">assessments over an appropriate database</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.890" end="00:40:52.070" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of pretty standard and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:54.290" style="s2">then we have to look at the turnaround</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.070" end="00:40:57.350" style="s2">time for getting the data back we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.290" end="00:40:58.940" style="s2">to look at the cost of it and all other</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.350" end="00:41:00.590" style="s2">aspects of viability and then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.940" end="00:41:06.520" style="s2">look at how relevant the data that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.590" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">showing us is and and what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.520" end="00:41:12.320" style="s2">interpretive confidence margin around</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:15.710" style="s2">clinical applications from that data</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.320" end="00:41:18.230" style="s2">looks like and so you know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.710" end="00:41:20.090" style="s2">doing parasitology and we really were</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.230" end="00:41:21.980" style="s2">just interested in do we see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.090" end="00:41:24.380" style="s2">parasite right but if we&#39;re doing some</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:27.980" style="s2">immunology connected to parasitology and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.380" end="00:41:29.600" style="s2">we&#39;re running CD 57 to say that someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.980" end="00:41:31.940" style="s2">has Lyme&#39;s disease but we know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.600" end="00:41:35.120" style="s2">not actually specific to Lyme it could</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.940" end="00:41:37.490" style="s2">be all kinds of infections then a CD 57</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.120" end="00:41:39.110" style="s2">for me means some kind of humoral</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.490" end="00:41:41.380" style="s2">infection usually and that&#39;s about all</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.110" end="00:41:43.400" style="s2">it means right so I can use it as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.380" end="00:41:46.460" style="s2">indicator along with many other</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.400" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">indicators for a complex set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.460" end="00:41:51.770" style="s2">assessments but I have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:56.660" style="s2">about my how I interpret that particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.770" end="00:41:58.220" style="s2">metric now as far as the platform that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.660" end="00:42:03.290" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in we want to make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.220" end="00:42:05.570" style="s2">platform that can upload any tests right</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.290" end="00:42:07.190" style="s2">so whether someone&#39;s comprehensive stool</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.570" end="00:42:08.600" style="s2">lab is coming from doctors data or</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.190" end="00:42:10.970" style="s2">Genova or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.600" end="00:42:12.500" style="s2">right if the sensitivity and specificity</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.970" end="00:42:13.940" style="s2">is known to be high enough to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.500" end="00:42:15.140" style="s2">meaningful confidence margin we won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.940" end="00:42:17.300" style="s2">able to upload any of them and be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.140" end="00:42:21.710" style="s2">to run data interpretation across them</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.300" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">in the future but it&#39;s also important to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.710" end="00:42:27.710" style="s2">know that I&#39;m very passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:33.190" style="s2">developing diagnostic technologies</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.710" end="00:42:37.430" style="s2">further because when when we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.190" end="00:42:42.980" style="s2">complex complex disease case solutions</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.430" end="00:42:44.300" style="s2">in particular I I want to look at all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.980" end="00:42:46.130" style="s2">the inflammatory markers all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.300" end="00:42:47.570" style="s2">autoimmune all the rheumatologic markers</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.130" end="00:42:49.400" style="s2">right I want to look at all of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.570" end="00:42:50.870" style="s2">of nutrient markers I look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.400" end="00:42:53.020" style="s2">genetics that I can see oh and look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.870" end="00:42:56.510" style="s2">all the clinical chemistry all because</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.020" end="00:42:59.600" style="s2">it ends up being that even some of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.510" end="00:43:00.830" style="s2">more obscure things show up and that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.600" end="00:43:02.900" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have thought to be associated</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.830" end="00:43:06.110" style="s2">show up in many of the difficult cases</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.900" end="00:43:07.850" style="s2">and non-obvious ways and so to even say</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.110" end="00:43:09.410" style="s2">order of operations of which diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.850" end="00:43:11.540" style="s2">to do first which to later I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.410" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">get them all cheaper all more reliable</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.540" end="00:43:17.590" style="s2">and be able to just do a lot more data</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:19.880" style="s2">on everybody and so there are kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.590" end="00:43:21.800" style="s2">technology that could make that possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.880" end="00:43:25.010" style="s2">like being able to do metabolomics on</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.800" end="00:43:27.620" style="s2">mass spectrometry could make metabolomic</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.010" end="00:43:31.310" style="s2">as has my very cheap and in near future</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.620" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">right across 2500 metabolites be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.310" end="00:43:36.290" style="s2">continuously run those and things like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:38.810" style="s2">you know single drop of blood on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.290" end="00:43:40.940" style="s2">technology like gene radar is getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.810" end="00:43:42.080" style="s2">very interesting and the next step</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.940" end="00:43:44.660" style="s2">beyond that is I think laser</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.080" end="00:43:47.360" style="s2">interferometry where we can test a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.660" end="00:43:49.310" style="s2">number of elements in the blood just</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.360" end="00:43:52.070" style="s2">through scattering patterns diffraction</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.310" end="00:43:53.750" style="s2">patterns on laser light going in you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.070" end="00:43:57.980" style="s2">could imagine if that technology got</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.750" end="00:43:59.600" style="s2">very far that we could testing all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.980" end="00:44:01.820" style="s2">the biometrics nearly continuously</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.600" end="00:44:04.280" style="s2">running big data on those and you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.820" end="00:44:07.310" style="s2">imagine how much we could learn and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.280" end="00:44:09.890" style="s2">that those are things that we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.310" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">future of medicine that&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.890" end="00:44:16.760" style="s2">picture because what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:18.890" style="s2">about is measuring you know the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.760" end="00:44:22.359" style="s2">that you&#39;re measuring are phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.890" end="00:44:26.780" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.359" end="00:44:29.660" style="s2">all kinds of different pieces of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.780" end="00:44:34.810" style="s2">body so to speak you know anything from</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.660" end="00:44:37.869" style="s2">extra meant to urine to mouth swabs to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.810" end="00:44:40.070" style="s2">you know a lot of there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.869" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">biomedical variables in that whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.070" end="00:44:43.670" style="s2">situation that you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:46.660" style="s2">many of which I don&#39;t know about myself</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.670" end="00:44:48.859" style="s2">because I&#39;m just a commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.660" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">practitioner I while I&#39;m listening to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.859" end="00:44:53.630" style="s2">you I&#39;m amazed because I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:55.700" style="s2">my own self discovery process while I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.630" end="00:44:57.349" style="s2">listening to you and how I was going</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:44:59.990" style="s2">along thinking hey this really worked</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.349" end="00:45:02.060" style="s2">but then it did so then I went into</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.990" end="00:45:03.950" style="s2">another level and say oh this works but</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.060" end="00:45:05.869" style="s2">hey here&#39;s another place for this new</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.950" end="00:45:09.380" style="s2">thing that I learned but it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.869" end="00:45:11.210" style="s2">so it&#39;s been one long process for me on</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.380" end="00:45:13.310" style="s2">a on a personal level of finding these</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.210" end="00:45:15.890" style="s2">different things that is why I value</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.310" end="00:45:17.869" style="s2">speaking to a person like yourself who</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.890" end="00:45:19.990" style="s2">has this this depth of knowledge with</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.869" end="00:45:22.849" style="s2">these like that whole thing is they</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.990" end="00:45:25.550" style="s2">spectral with the blood cell what was</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.849" end="00:45:28.420" style="s2">that what was that called you had some</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.550" end="00:45:32.540" style="s2">you&#39;re shooting laser into was laser and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.420" end="00:45:34.690" style="s2">laser interferometry is there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.540" end="00:45:37.970" style="s2">little that I can access right now and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.690" end="00:45:41.480" style="s2">we&#39;re not sure how much we&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.970" end="00:45:45.290" style="s2">assess but I I have a hope the dance</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.480" end="00:45:47.900" style="s2">will be a lot and so the deal there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.290" end="00:45:51.530" style="s2">you&#39;re actually just putting a beam of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.900" end="00:45:54.650" style="s2">light coherent light into say your wrist</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.530" end="00:45:56.150" style="s2">vein and then it bounces back but based</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.650" end="00:45:58.010" style="s2">on what&#39;s in the blood what molecules</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.150" end="00:46:00.290" style="s2">are in the blood the frequencies of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.010" end="00:46:02.119" style="s2">light will scatter and they&#39;ll scatter</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.290" end="00:46:04.460" style="s2">differently based on different molecules</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.119" end="00:46:06.740" style="s2">and different densities of them so you</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.460" end="00:46:08.810" style="s2">can tell blood glucose without taking</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.740" end="00:46:10.760" style="s2">one drop of blood right but then the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.810" end="00:46:14.030" style="s2">question is which molecules in the blood</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.760" end="00:46:15.859" style="s2">could we assess and could it be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.030" end="00:46:19.640" style="s2">more of them and could it be mostly all</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.859" end="00:46:22.730" style="s2">of them and so whether it&#39;s mass spec on</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.640" end="00:46:26.540" style="s2">urine doing you know metabolites or</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.730" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">whether it&#39;s lilies or interferometry or</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.540" end="00:46:30.940" style="s2">who knows</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">far out bio field assessments I think I</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.940" end="00:46:35.970" style="s2">think we what we know for sure is we</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:39.210" style="s2">will be able to get more and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.970" end="00:46:42.990" style="s2">more data more often more Rubik wit</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.210" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">ously so that we can understand patterns</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.990" end="00:46:48.980" style="s2">across lots of people but even within a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">single person and as that happens it</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.980" end="00:46:54.200" style="s2">progressively exceeds the ability of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">individual people to understand fully</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.200" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">without some aid in processing and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:01.470" style="s2">that&#39;s where as the diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:03.000" style="s2">technologies get better the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.470" end="00:47:03.840" style="s2">interpretative technologies need to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.000" end="00:47:05.609" style="s2">better and that&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.840" end="00:47:08.369" style="s2">interpretative models that the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.609" end="00:47:11.880" style="s2">and people can learn but also processing</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.369" end="00:47:13.800" style="s2">those the data through those models so</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.880" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">to translate a little bit if you take</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.800" end="00:47:19.790" style="s2">some of these labs like Genova Great</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:22.950" style="s2">Plains or whatever you and you find some</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.790" end="00:47:25.380" style="s2">level of confluence of successful</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.950" end="00:47:27.050" style="s2">information from them that would just be</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.380" end="00:47:29.640" style="s2">a piece of what you&#39;re envisioning</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.050" end="00:47:33.570" style="s2">because they would only cover the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.640" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">dimension that that lab is skilled at</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.570" end="00:47:38.869" style="s2">great right and so you have to then have</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:41.190" style="s2">a number of different you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.869" end="00:47:42.540" style="s2">not one module that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.190" end="00:47:43.890" style="s2">several different modules it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.540" end="00:47:45.089" style="s2">going to be worked up and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.890" end="00:47:49.380" style="s2">figure out integrate and synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.089" end="00:47:51.390" style="s2">those modules into into one at once I</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.380" end="00:47:54.839" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say one answer but one series</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.390" end="00:47:56.580" style="s2">of answers right so I&#39;m not a I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.839" end="00:47:58.220" style="s2">doctor I&#39;m a researcher but I&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.580" end="00:48:00.050" style="s2">with a number of Integrative doctors on</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.220" end="00:48:03.960" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.050" end="00:48:05.880" style="s2">traditionally incurable cases and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.960" end="00:48:10.440" style="s2">so we looked at what are all the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.880" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">that the literature knows is initially</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.440" end="00:48:15.869" style="s2">correlated and then how do we assess for</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:18.839" style="s2">those and that would look like I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.869" end="00:48:21.780" style="s2">have a relationship with one lab to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:25.849" style="s2">Michael plasmas and another one to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.780" end="00:48:28.230" style="s2">viruses and another one to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.849" end="00:48:31.080" style="s2">parasitology and protozoa and another</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.230" end="00:48:34.170" style="s2">one for the best Rheumatology and other</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.080" end="00:48:35.460" style="s2">ones for scans and that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.170" end="00:48:37.320" style="s2">usually several different types for</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.460" end="00:48:38.790" style="s2">different kinds of brain scans and other</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.320" end="00:48:42.300" style="s2">ones from you coastal barrier function</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.790" end="00:48:43.890" style="s2">right and other ones for mold and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.300" end="00:48:46.859" style="s2">biotoxin information the other ones for</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.890" end="00:48:49.500" style="s2">environmental toxins and so what that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.859" end="00:48:49.860" style="s2">means is that&#39;s just so burdensome on</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.500" end="00:48:53.700" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.860" end="00:48:55.380" style="s2">Nishan and on the office staff have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.700" end="00:48:56.730" style="s2">set up all those relationships send them</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.380" end="00:48:59.460" style="s2">different places and spend the blood</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.730" end="00:49:00.900" style="s2">this way and etc that we really need the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.460" end="00:49:04.830" style="s2">field of Diagnostics to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.900" end="00:49:07.260" style="s2">fundamentally better otherwise some</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.830" end="00:49:09.090" style="s2">diseases are incurable that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.260" end="00:49:10.350" style="s2">really incurable simply because what it</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.090" end="00:49:14.520" style="s2">takes to figure them out is too hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.350" end="00:49:17.700" style="s2">that is so true we see that every day</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.520" end="00:49:20.790" style="s2">I mean the the whole spectrum of how you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.700" end="00:49:22.620" style="s2">actually just get the test taking it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.790" end="00:49:25.050" style="s2">requires you know forget managed care</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.620" end="00:49:26.460" style="s2">and answering it to myriads of people in</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.050" end="00:49:30.900" style="s2">managed care who with high school</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.460" end="00:49:32.490" style="s2">education below that is how do you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.900" end="00:49:34.620" style="s2">fill out the paperwork and get to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.490" end="00:49:36.090" style="s2">the laboratory information back to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.620" end="00:49:38.100" style="s2">pull it together and then how do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.090" end="00:49:40.590" style="s2">spend the time to put it together and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.100" end="00:49:43.230" style="s2">get a and and put together a program for</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.590" end="00:49:45.120" style="s2">a person yeah it&#39;s great it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.230" end="00:49:47.550" style="s2">difficult right now why are you why</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.120" end="00:49:48.810" style="s2">you&#39;re talking I was thinking about an</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.550" end="00:49:50.430" style="s2">experience I had with some really</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.810" end="00:49:54.090" style="s2">interesting neurofeedback people when I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.430" end="00:49:55.860" style="s2">add the office up in DC he mo</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.090" end="00:50:01.050" style="s2">encephalography when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.860" end="00:50:03.180" style="s2">about that particular technique because</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.050" end="00:50:05.340" style="s2">even now and people out there need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.180" end="00:50:08.670" style="s2">know that you could put a band on and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.340" end="00:50:10.950" style="s2">shoot red infrared spectrums</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.670" end="00:50:13.050" style="s2">near-infrared hemo and encephalography</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.950" end="00:50:15.660" style="s2">you can shoot it right through the skull</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.050" end="00:50:17.550" style="s2">have it bounce out and get readings on</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.660" end="00:50:18.810" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with the oxygenation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.550" end="00:50:21.630" style="s2">the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.810" end="00:50:24.540" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s there that&#39;s here right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.630" end="00:50:26.250" style="s2">now which is and it&#39;s not difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.540" end="00:50:30.780" style="s2">do I mean the technology is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.250" end="00:50:35.250" style="s2">doggone simple to do require I should</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.780" end="00:50:39.000" style="s2">say it&#39;s true well yeah I mean the s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.250" end="00:50:41.880" style="s2">near technology is pretty simple easy</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.000" end="00:50:44.250" style="s2">technology and EEG is becoming simple</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.880" end="00:50:49.470" style="s2">enough that home EEG units are actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.250" end="00:50:53.460" style="s2">meaning meaningful data sources and home</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.470" end="00:50:54.630" style="s2">HRV units are good and so this is one</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.460" end="00:50:58.770" style="s2">what&#39;s the HRV</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.630" end="00:51:01.770" style="s2">heart rate variability okay and so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.770" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">which is a major indicator of autonomic</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.770" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">um and so there it this whole field what</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:10.289" style="s2">we call quantified self the various</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.059" style="s2">kinds of devices that allows health</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.289" end="00:51:13.890" style="s2">measurement I think is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.059" end="00:51:18.029" style="s2">huge part of the future of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.890" end="00:51:19.829" style="s2">where people take more and more</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.029" end="00:51:23.730" style="s2">responsibility for their own well-being</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.829" end="00:51:27.390" style="s2">and this means that already people have</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.730" end="00:51:29.609" style="s2">the ability to buy their own supplements</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.390" end="00:51:31.230" style="s2">and you know do a number of their own</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.609" end="00:51:33.450" style="s2">therapeutic modalities but they also</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.230" end="00:51:36.359" style="s2">they need to be able to track right if</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.450" end="00:51:39.329" style="s2">it if they really want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.359" end="00:51:41.670" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and so I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.329" end="00:51:44.460" style="s2">those are increasing yeah track your</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.670" end="00:51:46.230" style="s2">time because they&#39;re gonna be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.460" end="00:51:48.749" style="s2">that assessment and then that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.230" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">somehow hooked back to your database of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.749" end="00:51:54.380" style="s2">hey it&#39;s working or no it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:57.569" style="s2">right it&#39;s not what do we do next</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.380" end="00:51:59.789" style="s2">so this is in the Dreaming phase for us</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.569" end="00:52:01.890" style="s2">in terms of all the things at that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.789" end="00:52:04.920" style="s2">platform we&#39;ll be able to do but we do</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.890" end="00:52:07.739" style="s2">hope that it gets to the place where we</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.920" end="00:52:09.180" style="s2">can do the kinds of complex data</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.739" end="00:52:12.809" style="s2">processing we&#39;re talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.180" end="00:52:14.430" style="s2">included then is if there is data</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.809" end="00:52:15.690" style="s2">missing that we would need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.430" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">figure it out that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.690" end="00:52:20.339" style="s2">recommend what kind of diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:22.769" style="s2">people get we could recommend doctors</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.339" end="00:52:24.420" style="s2">for them to go work within a network but</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.769" end="00:52:26.970" style="s2">we could also be able to recommend which</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.420" end="00:52:29.430" style="s2">of the home assessment technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.970" end="00:52:33.150" style="s2">best from vetting them so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.430" end="00:52:35.099" style="s2">we&#39;re empowering people to have more</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.150" end="00:52:37.859" style="s2">ability to participate in their own</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.099" end="00:52:39.450" style="s2">well-being now that&#39;s a reason for all</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.859" end="00:52:41.430" style="s2">of our listeners to go right over to</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.450" end="00:52:43.710" style="s2">neuro hacker and get hooked up</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.430" end="00:52:47.249" style="s2">immediately because they need to be on</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.710" end="00:52:49.950" style="s2">your list right now because if you then</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.249" end="00:52:54.089" style="s2">have next week or next month or next</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.950" end="00:52:56.519" style="s2">year some way of beginning this process</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.089" end="00:52:58.859" style="s2">of measurement that you folks have</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.519" end="00:53:01.890" style="s2">signed off on that you think is going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.859" end="00:53:03.539" style="s2">be valid and useful then they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.890" end="00:53:05.849" style="s2">there I mean our whole audience this</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.539" end="00:53:07.279" style="s2">ours is a small audience I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.849" end="00:53:10.890" style="s2">a bigger audience out there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.279" end="00:53:12.869" style="s2">curious about this but I think anybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.890" end="00:53:14.339" style="s2">that ever listens to this should be just</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.869" end="00:53:16.650" style="s2">immediately hooked up with neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.339" end="00:53:18.329" style="s2">I&#39;m quite enthusiastic about</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.650" end="00:53:20.490" style="s2">having had the chance to speak with you</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.329" end="00:53:23.099" style="s2">because what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.490" end="00:53:25.079" style="s2">where we&#39;re I think so many people want</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.099" end="00:53:28.440" style="s2">to be but don&#39;t know how to get there</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.079" end="00:53:30.180" style="s2">myself included I think you know you</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.440" end="00:53:33.270" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s such an interesting place</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.180" end="00:53:34.859" style="s2">to be and to even envision the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.270" end="00:53:37.470" style="s2">possibilities are there because the mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.859" end="00:53:39.000" style="s2">does seem you know completely out there</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.470" end="00:53:41.220" style="s2">it&#39;s just we can&#39;t even talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.000" end="00:53:42.450" style="s2">it&#39;s just over our heads nothing to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.220" end="00:53:47.819" style="s2">about all these different things</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.450" end="00:53:51.390" style="s2">IgG is still complex if as mundane is</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.819" end="00:53:53.460" style="s2">that simple test is a lot of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.390" end="00:53:55.980" style="s2">a belief system to some you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.460" end="00:53:57.900" style="s2">still it&#39;s this Galileo moment you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.980" end="00:53:59.730" style="s2">the Sun is rotating around Rome I know</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.900" end="00:54:03.180" style="s2">it is I can see it is so we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.730" end="00:54:06.210" style="s2">to worry about that and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.180" end="00:54:08.400" style="s2">what&#39;s going on so we really do have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.210" end="00:54:09.809" style="s2">close Daniel I really I know you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.400" end="00:54:10.950" style="s2">little bit under the weather and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.809" end="00:54:13.020" style="s2">tell you how much I appreciate you</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.059" end="00:54:20.369" style="s2">is gonna be one of our most outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.690" end="00:54:21.660" style="s2">interviews because why because people</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.369" end="00:54:26.059" style="s2">are going to have to listen to it more</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.660" end="00:54:29.220" style="s2">than once because you are so deep and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.059" end="00:54:31.410" style="s2">interesting that people are going to are</p>
