<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:25.560" style="s2">thinkers or you were on yeah we did a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.210" end="00:00:27.900" style="s2">dual episode</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.560" end="00:00:31.650" style="s2">yeah the dual episode three months ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.900" end="00:00:33.380" style="s2">something like yeah yeah so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">interesting we&#39;re at the same event here</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.380" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">we&#39;re obviously kind of in a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">same networks and we&#39;re looking we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">interviewing a lot of the same people</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">we&#39;ve all had Jordan Greenhalgh on</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">Danish Max and Berger if you had Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:50.430" style="s2">wheel won&#39;t you know it&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:52.250" style="s2">yes inevitable yeah and so yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.430" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.250" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">kind of where we feel like we all feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">that we&#39;re part of this same</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">conversation looking at different parts</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">of it with different emphases I think we</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">can talk about what kind of different</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">embassies are but what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.340" style="s2">interesting is that this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">seems to be becoming this is dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.340" end="00:01:12.390" style="s2">to talk about without sounding really</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">wanky and really kind of pretentious but</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.390" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense that this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">is becoming a little bit more self-aware</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">and we&#39;ve kind of trying to play with</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">different names for it I&#39;ve heard it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">called the metal web the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:28.380" style="s2">web intellectual deep web with something</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:29.549" style="s2">compared to kind of intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.380" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">web was something that we were playing</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.549" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">with for a while what&#39;s your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">word I actually really like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:39.240" style="s2">intellectual light web because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">little bit if it kind of like a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.240" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">bit farcical you know and doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">clearly is not taking itself too</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.729" style="s2">which I appreciate but the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">web I think is sense making web and game</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.729" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">B seem to be the two frames that I see</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">having the most momentum at least like</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">in my neck of the woods yeah for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">the minimum viable meme is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:00.979" style="s2">looking for so I actually really agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">with you on game B I think that works</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.979" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">yeah and how would you summarize the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">differences in terms of like your</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">particular focus and your particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">focus on future thinkers we have less of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:13.990" style="s2">a structure than I think you guys do</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">which we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.990" end="00:02:18.550" style="s2">wherever we feel like going historically</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:20.200" style="s2">speaking that&#39;s been the case now we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.550" end="00:02:22.540" style="s2">definitely focusing a lot more on sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.200" end="00:02:24.850" style="s2">making and sovereignty as far as Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.540" end="00:02:27.880" style="s2">smarty burgers defined it that&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.850" end="00:02:29.890" style="s2">a huge thing I always wanted to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.880" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">big problems in the world and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.890" end="00:02:35.560" style="s2">actually start to approach those and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">and I have both continually landed on</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.560" end="00:02:39.400" style="s2">the conclusion that it becomes it more</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:41.620" style="s2">important to focus on individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.400" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">sovereignty and how we make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.620" end="00:02:49.450" style="s2">world that&#39;s where everything starts</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:51.880" style="s2">yeah I suppose like you know in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.450" end="00:02:54.430" style="s2">I think there are obviously an avid</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.880" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">listener to oh I wasn&#39;t mean both of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.430" end="00:02:59.320" style="s2">your projects I don&#39;t really listen to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">my own you know but any so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.320" end="00:03:06.520" style="s2">distinction that I feel for me is</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:08.110" style="s2">something about the exploration one I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.520" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">feel like my podcast is a bit more like</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.110" end="00:03:13.720" style="s2">kind of philosophical and sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.910" style="s2">performative like there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.720" end="00:03:18.220" style="s2">aesthetic to it that isn&#39;t quite like an</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.910" end="00:03:20.500" style="s2">interview it&#39;s more like a dance like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.220" end="00:03:23.560" style="s2">conversational dance like for me I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.500" end="00:03:28.180" style="s2">very inspired by like authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.560" end="00:03:30.610" style="s2">and sort of just the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.180" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">having a beautiful conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.610" end="00:03:35.770" style="s2">something new is discovered in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">meeting of the conversation right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.770" end="00:03:38.860" style="s2">then definitely takes place I know in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">both of your projects but for me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.860" end="00:03:43.660" style="s2">more of a kind of aesthetic like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.250" style="s2">been guiding me the whole way and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.660" end="00:03:48.460" style="s2">again like the kind of playing more in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.250" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">this philosophical conceptual territory</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.460" end="00:03:53.830" style="s2">I think it feels like it&#39;s very much a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:56.200" style="s2">part of my project yeah yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.830" end="00:03:58.900" style="s2">interested I mean we&#39;ve we&#39;re all kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.200" end="00:04:04.180" style="s2">of talking about practice now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.900" end="00:04:05.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a real focus on practice and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.180" end="00:04:07.330" style="s2">to get ourselves into these spaces for</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.740" end="00:04:09.220" style="s2">generative dialogue and sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.330" end="00:04:11.410" style="s2">that&#39;s a real focus for all of us but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.220" end="00:04:13.450" style="s2">think definitely I feel that with with</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.410" end="00:04:17.920" style="s2">you Daniel because I&#39;m fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.450" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">your kind of a modern monk hermit living</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.920" end="00:04:22.570" style="s2">in a monastery putting these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">what Peter Lindbergh will call mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.570" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">artifacts out into the world that must</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:28.530" style="s2">be a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:30.750" style="s2">to be part of well yeah definitely mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.530" end="00:04:32.430" style="s2">it it it is also the case that it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.750" end="00:04:34.680" style="s2">through the exploration of the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.430" end="00:04:36.660" style="s2">that I it was revealed to me that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.680" end="00:04:39.480" style="s2">actually had to go into training to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.660" end="00:04:41.160" style="s2">embody this sort of world that was being</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.480" end="00:04:43.110" style="s2">called for I think in the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.160" end="00:04:44.730" style="s2">were having like it was revealed to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.110" end="00:04:47.220" style="s2">how important personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.730" end="00:04:49.710" style="s2">was like not that I was like not doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.220" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">work on myself but just how core that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.710" end="00:04:56.250" style="s2">was and how to some degree I was like</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">fooling myself thinking that I was more</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.250" end="00:05:02.640" style="s2">in integrity with what that was asking</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">then I was you know and so that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.640" end="00:05:05.850" style="s2">of the reason I went back and yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:07.530" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that I would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.850" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">have the conversations I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.530" end="00:05:13.140" style="s2">without like participating in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:15.060" style="s2">of space of practice you know for me to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.140" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">do it because a lot of these things can</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.060" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">get so abstract</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:22.200" style="s2">you&#39;re not like living it - it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:24.300" style="s2">feel like it would work or make sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.200" end="00:05:26.070" style="s2">yeah and I want to want to back up a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.300" end="00:05:27.450" style="s2">little bit and just for people maybe who</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.070" end="00:05:29.040" style="s2">are watching you not sort of familiar by</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.450" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">where we&#39;re taking a lot for granted</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.040" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">here in terms of even talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:36.750" style="s2">practice and talking about sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:39.060" style="s2">and like for me what I found very really</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">useful was I did a training as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.060" end="00:05:42.600" style="s2">counselor and so I&#39;ve got a background</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.630" style="s2">as a journalist but I also did training</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.600" end="00:05:48.030" style="s2">as a counselor about a year and a half</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.630" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">two years ago and I really felt a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.030" end="00:05:51.330" style="s2">different quality of my interviews from</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">that space when I was able to be much</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.330" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">more present and much more available and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:59.700" style="s2">that I think has really informed a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:01.770" style="s2">of the the interviews that that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.700" end="00:06:04.440" style="s2">done since on um rebel wisdom and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.770" end="00:06:05.820" style="s2">it&#39;s much more about about how present</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.440" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">can you be and how present in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.820" end="00:06:08.490" style="s2">can you be in there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:11.400" style="s2">different practices that can help with</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.490" end="00:06:12.810" style="s2">that from now mindfulness to circling</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.400" end="00:06:15.720" style="s2">authentic relating all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.810" end="00:06:17.730" style="s2">stuff and what would you say might</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.720" end="00:06:19.260" style="s2">what&#39;s your kind of relationship to to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.730" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">practice and have you felt things</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.260" end="00:06:22.440" style="s2">shifting you know you&#39;ve kind of put it</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:24.870" style="s2">in perspective for me a little bit -</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.440" end="00:06:27.720" style="s2">just describing your your path through</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.870" end="00:06:30.450" style="s2">this the conversation that we have on</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.720" end="00:06:33.960" style="s2">future thinkers is really a couple&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.450" end="00:06:35.669" style="s2">conversation and it started off just</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.960" end="00:06:37.380" style="s2">this breakfast-time conversation and has</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.669" end="00:06:38.409" style="s2">gone through so we&#39;ve had this these</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.380" end="00:06:39.819" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.409" end="00:06:41.860" style="s2">contemplative practices and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.819" end="00:06:44.259" style="s2">conversations about psychology and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.860" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">developmental psychology and society and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.259" end="00:06:48.550" style="s2">these things just became something we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">thought maybe other people would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.550" end="00:06:52.749" style="s2">interested in so we turned on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:54.039" style="s2">recorder so the conversation that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.749" end="00:06:55.389" style="s2">have with other people as well as kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.039" end="00:06:57.069" style="s2">of the same it&#39;s like they&#39;re entering</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.389" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">into our conversation that&#39;s continually</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.069" end="00:07:01.839" style="s2">evolving the practice itself has just</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">been part of our lives just it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.839" end="00:07:07.029" style="s2">something worth talking about for us</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:09.159" style="s2">until the podcast turned on but deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.029" end="00:07:10.839" style="s2">meditation we focused a lot in our</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.159" end="00:07:13.659" style="s2">meditation practice on resilience and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.839" end="00:07:16.239" style="s2">focusing on dealing with and processing</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.659" end="00:07:17.559" style="s2">difficult emotions and in doing that for</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.239" end="00:07:19.739" style="s2">a long enough time it became really</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.559" end="00:07:23.009" style="s2">difficult to find more things to become</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.739" end="00:07:25.179" style="s2">emotional over or Reaction reactive to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.009" end="00:07:28.419" style="s2">and that was interesting so we just</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.179" end="00:07:30.699" style="s2">started talking about that yeah just to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.419" end="00:07:33.069" style="s2">say it&#39;s a real shine UV can&#39;t be with</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.699" end="00:07:35.979" style="s2">us well it&#39;s because she&#39;s seven months</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.069" end="00:07:37.569" style="s2">pregnant now so she can&#39;t move so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.979" end="00:07:39.389" style="s2">gonna have our own little psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.569" end="00:07:41.319" style="s2">experiment in a few months</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.389" end="00:07:46.139" style="s2">yeah that would be a learning experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.319" end="00:07:48.429" style="s2">yeah yeah and and also I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.139" end="00:07:50.559" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting to me as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.429" end="00:07:52.509" style="s2">is that the I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.559" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">just the sort of the personal biases</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.509" end="00:07:55.990" style="s2">that I&#39;m personally bringing into it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:57.849" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re all bringing to it but this</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.990" end="00:07:59.829" style="s2">sense of a lot of things moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.849" end="00:08:02.740" style="s2">same direction that this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.829" end="00:08:04.659" style="s2">personal practice world has been coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.740" end="00:08:06.519" style="s2">together more with the systems change</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.659" end="00:08:08.919" style="s2">and the existential risk and all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.519" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">bigger topics but it feels like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.919" end="00:08:14.229" style="s2">a really fascinating teleology direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:16.599" style="s2">to this conversation I think we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.229" end="00:08:19.239" style="s2">feeling and I wonder whether that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.599" end="00:08:21.189" style="s2">personal bias that we&#39;re projecting into</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.239" end="00:08:22.869" style="s2">it or whether it is and it is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.189" end="00:08:25.329" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging from the conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.869" end="00:08:27.519" style="s2">have something to say about that I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.329" end="00:08:29.529" style="s2">is really has been really interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.519" end="00:08:30.959" style="s2">watch because I think I&#39;ve got my pot</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.529" end="00:08:34.120" style="s2">guest has been around for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.959" end="00:08:35.409" style="s2">compared to you guys and it&#39;s just been</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.120" end="00:08:38.379" style="s2">this conversation that&#39;s just been</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.409" end="00:08:40.029" style="s2">really whatever if we feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.379" end="00:08:41.860" style="s2">month it&#39;s never had a direction or a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.029" end="00:08:44.529" style="s2">line but other people have pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.860" end="00:08:46.569" style="s2">to us that over time years of doing this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.529" end="00:08:48.970" style="s2">there is a line to it it&#39;s that there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.569" end="00:08:50.769" style="s2">a narrative that has emerged and so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.970" end="00:08:51.850" style="s2">with this movement there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.769" end="00:08:53.860" style="s2">focus on</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.850" end="00:08:55.949" style="s2">how do we direct it how do we become</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.860" end="00:08:58.750" style="s2">conscious and direct it and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.949" end="00:09:00.759" style="s2">the whole idea of emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.750" end="00:09:02.649" style="s2">collective sense making is that it comes</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.759" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">along without your focus and attention</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.649" end="00:09:08.500" style="s2">it just emerges out of its own</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:11.380" style="s2">properties and I think the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.500" end="00:09:15.130" style="s2">kind of focus and direct it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.380" end="00:09:16.420" style="s2">almost working against the movement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.130" end="00:09:19.300" style="s2">I mean so what&#39;s coming up for me is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.420" end="00:09:20.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.300" end="00:09:24.639" style="s2">which we are actually we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.680" end="00:09:26.290" style="s2">participating in the like the creation</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.639" end="00:09:28.149" style="s2">of a new meta-narrative right and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.290" end="00:09:29.199" style="s2">kind of like as we&#39;re participating the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.149" end="00:09:31.269" style="s2">creation of it we&#39;re also being</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.199" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">subjected to it right and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.269" end="00:09:35.110" style="s2">kind of feedback loop where it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:37.329" style="s2">gain some momentum of its own and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.110" end="00:09:39.459" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like wait are we biasing it</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.329" end="00:09:40.540" style="s2">or we observing it what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.459" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">here and I think we&#39;re actually had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.540" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">really interesting inflection point</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:45.610" style="s2">where as you&#39;re saying like it feels</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:48.850" style="s2">like there&#39;s something happening here</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.610" end="00:09:50.889" style="s2">like are we doing it and it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.850" end="00:09:53.110" style="s2">a lot like some spaces in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.889" end="00:09:54.850" style="s2">right where you&#39;re like am I making this</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.110" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">happen am i am i doing this or is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.850" end="00:09:59.470" style="s2">like actually happening what what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:01.630" style="s2">know and I think that actually that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.470" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">just how it is right like that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.630" end="00:10:05.470" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go down is we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:07.810" style="s2">like participate this into being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.470" end="00:10:09.130" style="s2">like not gonna be real or not real but</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.810" end="00:10:11.410" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna like have an impact</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.130" end="00:10:13.660" style="s2">it&#39;s getting new stuff and it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.410" end="00:10:16.180" style="s2">important and significant yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.660" end="00:10:18.279" style="s2">think they line through it all will</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.180" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">emerge and a lot more clarity as more</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.279" end="00:10:23.019" style="s2">people or participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2">conversation yeah yeah yeah the piece</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.019" end="00:10:28.449" style="s2">around like there&#39;s this kind of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.300" end="00:10:32.199" style="s2">of like harmony or integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.449" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">personal work and the kind of mmm like</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.199" end="00:10:38.139" style="s2">vision of the future of systems in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:39.670" style="s2">general of like this kind of like idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.139" end="00:10:42.610" style="s2">of Omni win right</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.670" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">it&#39;s like Omni win planet yes Omni win</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.610" end="00:10:49.000" style="s2">nation yes Omni win community yes Omni</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:51.610" style="s2">win like in this triad yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.000" end="00:10:53.199" style="s2">Omni win in my psyche right like there</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.610" end="00:10:54.610" style="s2">are parts of me can I bring them into</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.199" end="00:10:57.819" style="s2">harmony so they&#39;re all kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.610" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">playing a game well together I was like</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.819" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">I think that the to the degree that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:04.500" style="s2">can see that harmony conceptually and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:08.370" style="s2">live it like</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.500" end="00:11:12.060" style="s2">like hell yes right and I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.370" end="00:11:13.830" style="s2">that that was in the mimetic space like</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.060" end="00:11:16.260" style="s2">very long though it certainly wasn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.830" end="00:11:17.910" style="s2">my mimetic space and like I was deep in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.260" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">I was a deep nerd about this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.910" end="00:11:23.490" style="s2">like this feels new to me yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:26.340" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.490" end="00:11:28.350" style="s2">branching points here one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.340" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">the nature of the online space does seem</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.350" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">to create these positive feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:36.230" style="s2">like that there&#39;s not a scarcity like</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:38.790" style="s2">that for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.230" end="00:11:40.080" style="s2">people can watch or listen to all of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.790" end="00:11:42.300" style="s2">podcasts and the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.080" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">talking to each other is not there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.300" end="00:11:45.780" style="s2">there&#39;s no scarcity here it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:47.580" style="s2">if they&#39;re not watching my channel</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.780" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">they&#39;re watching your channel and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.580" end="00:11:52.860" style="s2">in rivalry with each other whereas where</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:54.360" style="s2">I come from Channel 4 News in the BBC</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:56.690" style="s2">channels you don&#39;t promote each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.590" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">channels because if someone&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.690" end="00:12:01.380" style="s2">BBC News they&#39;re not watching Channel 4</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.380" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">implicit so there is already in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.620" end="00:12:09.210" style="s2">digital world the possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:10.290" style="s2">non-rivalry Stein Amex in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.210" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">don&#39;t think there were before</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.290" end="00:12:14.940" style="s2">I mean if tension is finite on some</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:18.360" style="s2">level so it doesn&#39;t go all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.940" end="00:12:20.070" style="s2">but but certainly and there are many</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.360" end="00:12:22.620" style="s2">more positive feedback loops and the new</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.070" end="00:12:25.770" style="s2">digital media environment there were in</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.620" end="00:12:28.020" style="s2">the old media environment the other the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.770" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">other branch that I was feeling as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.020" end="00:12:33.690" style="s2">was this sort of only win dynamic you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:35.400" style="s2">talking about in game B the idea of game</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.690" end="00:12:40.590" style="s2">B is the sort of none rival or a space</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.400" end="00:12:43.530" style="s2">and I had a real realization on our most</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.590" end="00:12:45.900" style="s2">recent workshop men&#39;s retreat where I</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.530" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">was like oh actually this space that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.900" end="00:12:51.510" style="s2">we&#39;re creating is is a game B space like</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.410" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve had the experience as</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.510" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">well on a workshop of just this space</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:57.900" style="s2">that opens up on say day 3 day 2 or day</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:59.250" style="s2">3 where you can just feel the field</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.900" end="00:13:01.230" style="s2">change and there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.250" end="00:13:04.410" style="s2">authenticity and there&#39;s this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.230" end="00:13:08.460" style="s2">sense of another a third or another</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.410" end="00:13:10.200" style="s2">space opening up where the air becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.460" end="00:13:12.510" style="s2">sort of heavy with significance and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.200" end="00:13:13.589" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no real way language for</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.510" end="00:13:15.050" style="s2">explaining this kind of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.589" end="00:13:18.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel cliched or weird</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.050" end="00:13:20.640" style="s2">but I realized in the closing circles I</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.120" end="00:13:22.260" style="s2">okay this is this is game B this is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.640" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve been making all these films about</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.260" end="00:13:27.089" style="s2">because there is something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:28.500" style="s2">craving on such a deep level where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.089" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">in our space where everyone wants the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.500" end="00:13:31.950" style="s2">best for each other and when someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:33.540" style="s2">really kind of has a realization or</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.950" end="00:13:36.600" style="s2">shows up in a new way they&#39;re honored</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.540" end="00:13:38.460" style="s2">for that and it&#39;s like wow yes I someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.600" end="00:13:41.010" style="s2">shares something really vulnerable or</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.460" end="00:13:42.630" style="s2">has some kind of insight and everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.010" end="00:13:45.270" style="s2">there with them and wanting the best for</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.630" end="00:13:46.700" style="s2">them and it&#39;s like we&#39;ve lost so much of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.270" end="00:13:48.870" style="s2">that because we&#39;re caught in these</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.700" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">zero-sum games with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.870" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">defensiveness patterns and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:54.510" style="s2">and so yeah that&#39;s too kind of possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">branches for the conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.510" end="00:14:01.170" style="s2">man yeah which one you want to jump on</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:03.960" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.170" end="00:14:07.080" style="s2">it is at the heart that that changes in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.960" end="00:14:08.670" style="s2">that group dynamic you know from there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.080" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">not a flow state there&#39;s what what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.670" end="00:14:12.690" style="s2">described there to suddenly we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:14.670" style="s2">harmony with each other and I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.690" end="00:14:16.620" style="s2">to isolate that point and get down to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.670" end="00:14:18.779" style="s2">the bottom of it and I think it has</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.620" end="00:14:20.760" style="s2">something to do with our desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.779" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">perceived a certain way and project are</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.760" end="00:14:25.500" style="s2">our best image to each other and in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">doing so we&#39;re less focused on the truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.500" end="00:14:29.750" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:32.790" style="s2">and more on how we&#39;re being perceived</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.750" end="00:14:34.500" style="s2">and and so I put a lot of focused into</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.790" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">that and with what we are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.500" end="00:14:39.420" style="s2">in the podcast now and in our courses</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:42.300" style="s2">that has become just such a central</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.420" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">point and in focusing on that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.300" end="00:14:45.810" style="s2">noticed an unlocking and sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:47.820" style="s2">immediately and an unlocking and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.810" end="00:14:50.580" style="s2">collective intelligence that is just I I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.820" end="00:14:53.459" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to experience anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.580" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">else and with any other groups in such a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.459" end="00:14:58.020" style="s2">stable way as what we&#39;ve been able to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:15:02.430" style="s2">with our our weekly calls the course</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.020" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">calls and it&#39;s just it&#39;s so simple but</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.430" end="00:15:07.140" style="s2">it&#39;s so hard to to get through to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:10.050" style="s2">point where you can actually just listen</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.140" end="00:15:12.510" style="s2">and look for truth in a group</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.050" end="00:15:14.430" style="s2">conversation yeah and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.510" end="00:15:18.900" style="s2">really significant that and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.430" end="00:15:20.490" style="s2">similar sense of what is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.900" end="00:15:22.529" style="s2">the in the monastery and the community</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.490" end="00:15:24.209" style="s2">that I did I live at that there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.529" end="00:15:25.770" style="s2">in which and I think it actually has</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.209" end="00:15:27.780" style="s2">always been the case that monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.770" end="00:15:28.950" style="s2">have been these kind of omni when local</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.780" end="00:15:31.889" style="s2">systems right</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.950" end="00:15:34.019" style="s2">and that there&#39;s the most important</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.889" end="00:15:37.139" style="s2">teaching there is actually what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.019" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">like just to be in that space right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.139" end="00:15:40.740" style="s2">if you do workshops if you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:42.690" style="s2">retreats you get to this point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.740" end="00:15:43.860" style="s2">like oh this is so wonderful this is and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.690" end="00:15:46.589" style="s2">then you say but I have to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.860" end="00:15:48.540" style="s2">the real world right and it&#39;s like is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.589" end="00:15:50.130" style="s2">there is what we&#39;re talking about to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.540" end="00:15:51.500" style="s2">some degree like taking the real world</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.130" end="00:15:54.060" style="s2">and making it more like these like</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.500" end="00:15:55.260" style="s2">beautiful spaces that we sometimes get</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.060" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">to participate because we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.260" end="00:16:00.329" style="s2">privileged and it&#39;s like maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:01.740" style="s2">sounds amazing that sounds really great</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.329" end="00:16:03.750" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s cool that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.740" end="00:16:06.510" style="s2">like different ways that we&#39;re offering</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.750" end="00:16:09.269" style="s2">these kinds of experiences like you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.510" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">whether it&#39;s online or residential or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.269" end="00:16:13.620" style="s2">weekend retreat you know and that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:15.209" style="s2">can get this like taste because I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.620" end="00:16:17.100" style="s2">that that&#39;s there is the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.209" end="00:16:20.370" style="s2">conversational aspect the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.100" end="00:16:24.769" style="s2">aspect but then there&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.370" end="00:16:27.570" style="s2">taste the flavor of it that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.769" end="00:16:28.980" style="s2">perhaps more important yeah actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.570" end="00:16:32.970" style="s2">probably more important</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.980" end="00:16:34.680" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve always found those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.970" end="00:16:36.209" style="s2">peak State experiences and there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.680" end="00:16:39.959" style="s2">ways of getting there as well as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.209" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">plant medicines and those Peak State</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.959" end="00:16:43.620" style="s2">experiences like there&#39;s really extreme</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:47.310" style="s2">ones as well I think almost feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.620" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">said a calling card and one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.310" end="00:16:50.220" style="s2">fascinating conversation I had around</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:53.250" style="s2">that was with Jordan Pederson just</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.220" end="00:16:56.790" style="s2">before the cameras were rolling and so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.250" end="00:16:57.750" style="s2">went over it - yeah so - two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.790" end="00:17:00.600" style="s2">when I did the interview with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.750" end="00:17:02.430" style="s2">Peterson I&#39;d gone to his lecture the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.600" end="00:17:05.660" style="s2">night before and he talked about Young&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.430" end="00:17:08.130" style="s2">idea of the self with the capital S as</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.660" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">something that is calling to us from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:12.540" style="s2">future that this sort of potential that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:14.790" style="s2">the potentially about potentiality of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.540" end="00:17:16.829" style="s2">our personality calling to us from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.790" end="00:17:18.689" style="s2">future through our interests through the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.829" end="00:17:21.209" style="s2">things that we are drawn to do in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.689" end="00:17:23.699" style="s2">lives there&#39;s some sort of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.209" end="00:17:26.059" style="s2">with this sort of kind of I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.699" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">feels a bit my terence mckenna&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.059" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">object at the end of time almost but and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:36.809" style="s2">I feel that that made so much sense I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:38.340" style="s2">just had this kind of like realization I</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.809" end="00:17:40.440" style="s2">talked to him just before the cameras</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.340" end="00:17:42.210" style="s2">are rolling about how meaningful I found</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">that because it felt like my</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.210" end="00:17:48.600" style="s2">Peak State experiences were like been in</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:50.340" style="s2">a in a completely open flow state and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.600" end="00:17:52.049" style="s2">they&#39;ve lasted like a couple of weeks at</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.340" end="00:17:53.460" style="s2">a time for months at a time I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.049" end="00:17:56.330" style="s2">like I don&#39;t need to think I just act</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.460" end="00:17:59.580" style="s2">from this real deeper space in myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.330" end="00:18:03.389" style="s2">those peak experiences like almost like</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.580" end="00:18:05.129" style="s2">calling to me from in some way they have</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.389" end="00:18:07.259" style="s2">this deeper resonance that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.129" end="00:18:09.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something in the future that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.259" end="00:18:11.639" style="s2">calling and orienting myself towards in</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.720" end="00:18:16.230" style="s2">an almost like gravitational field kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.639" end="00:18:19.110" style="s2">of way yeah yeah even her people at this</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.230" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">gathering refer to like attractors right</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.110" end="00:18:22.169" style="s2">which is a similar kind of sentiment I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.730" end="00:18:23.610" style="s2">think more in terms of like systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.169" end="00:18:26.220" style="s2">theory where you have like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.610" end="00:18:28.139" style="s2">possibility of like an attractor in one</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.220" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2">teacher that I really appreciate talks</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.139" end="00:18:31.470" style="s2">about like the angel out ahead right</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.700" end="00:18:33.570" style="s2">there kind of like tracking something</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.470" end="00:18:35.879" style="s2">that you may never actually reach but</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.570" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like calling you forward in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.879" end="00:18:41.009" style="s2">a way that it perhaps actually that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:42.690" style="s2">the desire to define it too rigidly</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.009" end="00:18:44.580" style="s2">conceptually might actually kill it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.690" end="00:18:46.019" style="s2">right so that&#39;s kind of why the flavor</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.580" end="00:18:47.879" style="s2">actually might be more important than</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.019" end="00:18:50.070" style="s2">the conversation around it but I feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.879" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">that way well it&#39;s not like for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.070" end="00:18:56.279" style="s2">not just peak experiences that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.740" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">think the community I live in for me is</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.279" end="00:19:02.450" style="s2">very significant is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:04.919" style="s2">pleasant to be there all the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.450" end="00:19:07.950" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s actually quite horrible</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.919" end="00:19:10.139" style="s2">right but it&#39;s within the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.950" end="00:19:12.360" style="s2">system that you can trust right you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.139" end="00:19:14.249" style="s2">that people are there for their their</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.360" end="00:19:17.159" style="s2">benefit and your benefit and like</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.249" end="00:19:20.929" style="s2">everything is kind of like chill like in</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.159" end="00:19:24.509" style="s2">trustworthy and wholesome and good</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.929" end="00:19:27.470" style="s2">fundamentally and that&#39;s there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.509" end="00:19:30.029" style="s2">different way of being that that enables</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.470" end="00:19:33.899" style="s2">that you don&#39;t actually see how</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.029" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">up this world is until you&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.899" end="00:19:39.899" style="s2">that and again it&#39;s like please do not</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:42.059" style="s2">imagine that being in a monastery is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.899" end="00:19:46.710" style="s2">just one peak experience after another</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.059" end="00:19:50.159" style="s2">it is not that definitively related your</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.710" end="00:19:51.899" style="s2">point about the gravity well and the the</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.899" end="00:19:54.260" style="s2">yourself there&#39;s an interview that I did</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.549" end="00:19:55.640" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.260" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">Kirby surprised who wrote this book</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.640" end="00:20:00.290" style="s2">about synchronicity and he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">synchronicities you know those those</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.290" end="00:20:04.550" style="s2">experiences we have of calling someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:06.020" style="s2">on the phone and they&#39;re thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.550" end="00:20:08.330" style="s2">calling us on the phone we just connect</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.020" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">or you know in this field that seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.330" end="00:20:12.790" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">synchronicity and synchronistic events</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.790" end="00:20:17.690" style="s2">what you get what you focus on that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:19.430" style="s2">what you get in this book he talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.690" end="00:20:20.990" style="s2">about how synchronicity can work</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:22.610" style="s2">forwards and backwards in time like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.990" end="00:20:24.680" style="s2">there can be a future event that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.610" end="00:20:27.080" style="s2">pulling you towards it like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.680" end="00:20:30.200" style="s2">examples he uses is actually an argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.080" end="00:20:31.820" style="s2">with his wife this big blowup argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.200" end="00:20:32.750" style="s2">that was rippling backwards and caught</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.820" end="00:20:34.490" style="s2">he was noticing all these</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.750" end="00:20:38.780" style="s2">synchronicities leading up to this event</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.490" end="00:20:41.000" style="s2">of like heightened emotional frustration</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.780" end="00:20:43.190" style="s2">and and it all just led up to this point</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.000" end="00:20:46.490" style="s2">this is all metaphysical and unprovable</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.190" end="00:20:48.380" style="s2">but just thinking about what we would do</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.490" end="00:20:50.060" style="s2">if we were gonna design our experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.380" end="00:20:52.660" style="s2">outside of time if consciousness can</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.060" end="00:20:56.570" style="s2">exist outside of time how would we do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.660" end="00:20:58.130" style="s2">and I would picture it being like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.570" end="00:21:00.470" style="s2">design would be something like these</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.130" end="00:21:03.500" style="s2">gravity wells experience that just pull</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.470" end="00:21:06.770" style="s2">us through in time and it kind of lined</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.500" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">up with this book yeah what&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.770" end="00:21:12.800" style="s2">for me too is that it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.660" style="s2">these ideas don&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.800" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">necessarily be so metaphysical right</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.660" end="00:21:20.120" style="s2">like the idea that time is like linear</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:21.590" style="s2">in the past is back there and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.120" end="00:21:24.050" style="s2">present is where we are now in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.590" end="00:21:26.570" style="s2">future is coming like we are I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.050" end="00:21:28.310" style="s2">part of what we are all sensing is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.570" end="00:21:30.560" style="s2">like we are in a time of deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.310" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">and B construction is happening both in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.560" end="00:21:35.300" style="s2">like the political economic social world</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:37.160" style="s2">but I think it also there is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.300" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">invitation for it to happen within the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.160" end="00:21:41.750" style="s2">kind of world of our metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:43.640" style="s2">assumptions about how reality kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.750" end="00:21:46.910" style="s2">functions and I like it for the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.640" end="00:21:49.340" style="s2">for me is like are we free to play with</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.910" end="00:21:51.230" style="s2">the idea that perhaps time flows</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.340" end="00:21:53.180" style="s2">differently than we&#39;ve been taught right</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.230" end="00:21:55.190" style="s2">not like to make a grand claim about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.180" end="00:21:57.170" style="s2">nature of reality but just to see what</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.190" end="00:21:59.180" style="s2">that opens up in terms of a space of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.170" end="00:22:01.820" style="s2">experimentation that might allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.180" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">kind of like I don&#39;t know do something</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.820" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">different because what&#39;s work what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:06.620" style="s2">been doing is not going to get us to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:07.510" style="s2">where we need to go and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.620" end="00:22:10.270" style="s2">yeah like those</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.510" end="00:22:13.330" style="s2">kinds of sort of like flips I think are</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.270" end="00:22:14.830" style="s2">so significant and it but then if like</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.330" end="00:22:17.590" style="s2">you&#39;re listening and you&#39;re like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.830" end="00:22:19.720" style="s2">not how time works it&#39;s like hmm okay so</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.590" end="00:22:22.630" style="s2">it sounds like you&#39;re not free to play</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.720" end="00:22:24.100" style="s2">in that way yeah no yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.630" end="00:22:25.930" style="s2">interesting the discussion about these</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.100" end="00:22:27.550" style="s2">kind of metaphysical things always have</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.930" end="00:22:29.140" style="s2">to come with this disclaimer like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.550" end="00:22:30.670" style="s2">not proven I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.140" end="00:22:32.200" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying but it&#39;s really just an</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.670" end="00:22:34.390" style="s2">experiment in a conversation see where</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.200" end="00:22:36.790" style="s2">we can take it and what lens do you look</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.390" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">through that gives you a completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.790" end="00:22:39.880" style="s2">different perspective in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:41.410" style="s2">maybe makes other things make sense like</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.880" end="00:22:44.590" style="s2">this whole idea of synchronicity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.410" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">time being only something we experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.590" end="00:22:48.190" style="s2">in a linear fashion but maybe it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:50.470" style="s2">existing at the same time that allows</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.190" end="00:22:52.570" style="s2">you you know more lenses to view things</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.470" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">through which is something that reminds</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.570" end="00:22:57.790" style="s2">me of John Vevey keys work in particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:23:00.520" style="s2">because he it&#39;s really interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.790" end="00:23:02.020" style="s2">see the development of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.520" end="00:23:04.990" style="s2">the development of the idea of even</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.020" end="00:23:07.390" style="s2">linear time this sort of Western</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.990" end="00:23:09.610" style="s2">narrative over of a beginning a middle</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.390" end="00:23:12.790" style="s2">and an end and time as a kind of arrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.610" end="00:23:14.620" style="s2">moving in one direction is actually it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.790" end="00:23:16.810" style="s2">actually had a beginning like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.620" end="00:23:19.870" style="s2">just the way understanding how much of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.810" end="00:23:21.970" style="s2">our cognitive framework has actually is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.870" end="00:23:24.580" style="s2">not pre stuff we just assume as</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.970" end="00:23:26.110" style="s2">pre-given has actually arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.580" end="00:23:28.690" style="s2">certain moments in the past and we were</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.110" end="00:23:31.420" style="s2">in more of an eternal now before then</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.690" end="00:23:33.640" style="s2">and maybe we&#39;re in one of those big</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.420" end="00:23:35.170" style="s2">shifts where we&#39;re becoming aware by</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.640" end="00:23:36.550" style="s2">becoming aware of how our thought has</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.170" end="00:23:39.610" style="s2">been patterned gives us a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">actually maybe reflect on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.610" end="00:23:43.810" style="s2">what we assumed was pre given</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:45.880" style="s2">cognitively and there&#39;s also another</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.810" end="00:23:47.560" style="s2">link that just came up with the internet</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.880" end="00:23:50.110" style="s2">I think Jordan Hall has talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.560" end="00:23:54.270" style="s2">as being eternal memory so we&#39;re now in</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.110" end="00:23:57.700" style="s2">a from the idea of kind of synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.270" end="00:23:59.620" style="s2">broadcast media we&#39;re now in a world of</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.700" end="00:24:01.990" style="s2">eternal memory and kind of an eternal</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.620" end="00:24:02.470" style="s2">now in some senses yeah yeah Douglas</p>

<p begin="00:24:04.330" end="00:24:07.780" style="s2">shock and it which is really striking</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.560" end="00:24:09.430" style="s2">for me it&#39;s like there&#39;s it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.780" end="00:24:14.530" style="s2">in an eternal presence but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.430" end="00:24:16.450" style="s2">very mmm like not the kind of eternal</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.530" end="00:24:17.890" style="s2">presence that you know you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.450" end="00:24:19.730" style="s2">and it&#39;s an eternal presence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.890" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">distraction and like confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.730" end="00:24:23.830" style="s2">from your devices and from like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:27.620" style="s2">world coming and invading your space</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.830" end="00:24:30.590" style="s2">right and it&#39;s yes there is a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.620" end="00:24:32.389" style="s2">funny way in which we are forced into an</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.590" end="00:24:34.340" style="s2">eternal presence like we&#39;ve lost that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.389" end="00:24:36.440" style="s2">sense of historicity against our will</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.340" end="00:24:38.179" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah we&#39;re strapped in</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.440" end="00:24:40.700" style="s2">front of the fire hose yeah you have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.179" end="00:24:42.200" style="s2">stay there yeah yeah yeah actually that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.700" end="00:24:43.250" style="s2">was a I think the last question I asked</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.200" end="00:24:45.019" style="s2">John for Vicki when he was on my show</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.250" end="00:24:46.820" style="s2">was like she&#39;s talking about psycho</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.019" end="00:24:50.419" style="s2">technologies and stuff and I was like so</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.820" end="00:24:54.909" style="s2">like is time itself a psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.419" end="00:24:57.169" style="s2">and he made a very kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.909" end="00:24:59.659" style="s2">distinction right this is like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.169" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">saying that time doesn&#39;t exist but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.659" end="00:25:04.309" style="s2">the the relationship of the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:07.100" style="s2">the capacity to kind of participate in</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.309" end="00:25:09.620" style="s2">time in a particular way is yes a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.100" end="00:25:11.799" style="s2">technology that kind of like arose in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.620" end="00:25:15.019" style="s2">particular time in context that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.799" end="00:25:17.480" style="s2">damn like what else are we taking for</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.019" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">granted there&#39;s this wonderful I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.480" end="00:25:21.220" style="s2">read it but you know the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.830" end="00:25:23.450" style="s2">consciousness and the bicameral mind but</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.220" end="00:25:25.399" style="s2">stop me if I&#39;m giving this wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.450" end="00:25:29.480" style="s2">what I understand from that is is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.399" end="00:25:32.539" style="s2">they the the the hypothesis in that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.480" end="00:25:34.610" style="s2">that when for example the Greek myths</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.539" end="00:25:35.809" style="s2">were being written they had a completely</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.610" end="00:25:37.130" style="s2">different relationship to these</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.809" end="00:25:39.110" style="s2">archetypes these archetypes were</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.130" end="00:25:42.490" style="s2">actually almost like physical presences</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.110" end="00:25:45.230" style="s2">in their lives and there wasn&#39;t this so</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.490" end="00:25:47.779" style="s2">it&#39;s a really interesting frame to look</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.230" end="00:25:48.919" style="s2">back at like the way that we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.779" end="00:25:52.070" style="s2">way that we&#39;re criticizing our</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.919" end="00:25:54.769" style="s2">understanding and mythological history</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.070" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">or our kind of mythopoetic history has</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.769" end="00:25:58.700" style="s2">to be fundamentally reevaluated because</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:00.529" style="s2">we&#39;re taking for granted a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.700" end="00:26:02.929" style="s2">that the consciousness itself has</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.529" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">fundamentally changed through through</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.929" end="00:26:07.580" style="s2">history and our relationships to these</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:09.350" style="s2">like the idea being that we actually did</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.580" end="00:26:12.710" style="s2">live in a world of gods and live in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.350" end="00:26:15.019" style="s2">world of spirits before and we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.710" end="00:26:18.200" style="s2">actually able to kind of perceive things</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.019" end="00:26:21.049" style="s2">in that way familiar with that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.200" end="00:26:23.389" style="s2">a little bit yeah and my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.049" end="00:26:27.460" style="s2">we almost like is john rebecca would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.389" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">sort of like discovered the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.460" end="00:26:32.539" style="s2">psycho technologies that enabled us to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.110" end="00:26:33.500" style="s2">become rational and perceive ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.539" end="00:26:36.350" style="s2">as like in</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.500" end="00:26:38.330" style="s2">visuals acting in coherent ways with</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.350" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">each other instead of like just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.330" end="00:26:42.680" style="s2">like being told what to do by Damon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:44.600" style="s2">right and like that this might have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.680" end="00:26:47.000" style="s2">like a transition point perhaps that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.600" end="00:26:49.070" style="s2">the axial revolution maybe but like just</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.000" end="00:26:51.230" style="s2">that that too is something that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.070" end="00:26:53.960" style="s2">take for granted that that&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.230" end="00:26:56.600" style="s2">affordance of the context and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.960" end="00:26:58.730" style="s2">of human consciousness is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.600" end="00:27:01.910" style="s2">I think it just speaks to how deep the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.730" end="00:27:04.070" style="s2">deconstruction rabbit-hole can go and to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.910" end="00:27:07.090" style="s2">how much is like up for grabs in terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.070" end="00:27:10.490" style="s2">of how much we could reimagine the human</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.090" end="00:27:12.110" style="s2">into the future yeah I&#39;m really curious</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.490" end="00:27:13.820" style="s2">what some of the breaking points were in</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.110" end="00:27:15.560" style="s2">these transitionary phases because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.820" end="00:27:18.350" style="s2">feel like one of the ones that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.560" end="00:27:21.050" style="s2">having now is this transition from pure</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.350" end="00:27:22.700" style="s2">rationality and to maybe there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.050" end="00:27:24.770" style="s2">experiment with and think about and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.700" end="00:27:27.260" style="s2">which is why I focus on these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.770" end="00:27:29.480" style="s2">frame breaking subjects like what is</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.260" end="00:27:30.890" style="s2">time and is there such thing as all-time</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.480" end="00:27:33.050" style="s2">existing at the same time what is</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.890" end="00:27:34.520" style="s2">synchronicity you know and a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.050" end="00:27:36.380" style="s2">for me can kind of stem out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.520" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">contemplating the double-slit experiment</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.380" end="00:27:39.770" style="s2">in quantum physics it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:41.870" style="s2">observer effects what is being observed</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.770" end="00:27:45.110" style="s2">and literally proven right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.870" end="00:27:46.850" style="s2">you anyone can see that so these I get</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.110" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">the sense in a lot of conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.850" end="00:27:50.210" style="s2">people that breaking out of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:52.550" style="s2">rational framework is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.210" end="00:27:55.370" style="s2">but also you need it&#39;s almost like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.550" end="00:27:57.050" style="s2">need a rational explanation of why you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.370" end="00:27:59.660" style="s2">need to rationally break out of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.050" end="00:28:01.970" style="s2">rational framework yeah yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.660" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">think that&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered as</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.970" end="00:28:08.840" style="s2">being like the key entrance point is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been sharing in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.840" end="00:28:14.870" style="s2">the monastery Levin is like moving from</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:16.460" style="s2">the sense that perception in the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.870" end="00:28:19.310" style="s2">is something that you are merely</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.460" end="00:28:21.110" style="s2">observing to realizing that it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.310" end="00:28:23.510" style="s2">something that you are participating in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.110" end="00:28:25.340" style="s2">and it is also participating in you and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.510" end="00:28:27.860" style="s2">that that&#39;s a kind of like fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.340" end="00:28:29.720" style="s2">shift they can take us out of this sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.860" end="00:28:31.430" style="s2">of like things are just happening to us</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.720" end="00:28:33.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re like watching it or consuming</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.430" end="00:28:35.750" style="s2">it you know and like that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.680" end="00:28:38.120" style="s2">one of the core logics that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.750" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">disrupted I think you&#39;re yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.120" end="00:28:42.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like that shift there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:44.500" style="s2">that come up one is another reference</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.679" end="00:28:46.620" style="s2">for another big book that I have</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.500" end="00:28:49.090" style="s2">red but I&#39;m fascinated the jean gebser</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.620" end="00:28:53.470" style="s2">talked about the breakdown of the mental</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.090" end="00:28:54.130" style="s2">rational consciousness and also a friend</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.470" end="00:28:57.010" style="s2">of mine</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.130" end="00:28:59.380" style="s2">Jules Evans put out a newsletter quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.010" end="00:29:02.710" style="s2">recently saying entitled dude where&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.380" end="00:29:04.690" style="s2">paradigm shift looking at how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.710" end="00:29:07.330" style="s2">brilliant just saying we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.690" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">about the idea of an imminent paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.330" end="00:29:11.950" style="s2">shift has been present for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:12.970" style="s2">like certainly since the sixties and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.950" end="00:29:13.750" style="s2">then you look back it&#39;s actually way</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.970" end="00:29:15.640" style="s2">before then</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.750" end="00:29:17.380" style="s2">and this sort of sense of ok one</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.640" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">consciousness structure the mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.380" end="00:29:22.510" style="s2">rationale is breaking down another one</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:24.610" style="s2">is is taking its place and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.510" end="00:29:27.100" style="s2">like I remember reading Richard Tarr</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.610" end="00:29:29.490" style="s2">NASA&#39;s passion of the Western mind which</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.100" end="00:29:32.790" style="s2">I still think is one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.490" end="00:29:34.930" style="s2">analyses about current psycho</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.790" end="00:29:35.980" style="s2">philosophical situation and where we</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.930" end="00:29:38.050" style="s2">might be going next I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.980" end="00:29:40.570" style="s2">fantastic and I think he&#39;s brilliant and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.050" end="00:29:42.700" style="s2">but yeah dude where&#39;s where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.570" end="00:29:45.310" style="s2">paradigm shift do we always think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.700" end="00:29:48.430" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of on the verge of it and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.310" end="00:29:49.690" style="s2">is this a tendency like is this a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.430" end="00:29:51.880" style="s2">tendency that we&#39;re all going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.690" end="00:29:53.350" style="s2">subject to and how do we know because we</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.880" end="00:30:02.040" style="s2">all feel like something&#39;s happening to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.350" end="00:30:02.040" style="s2">quote Dave Rubin yeah what do you reckon</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.910" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">yeah it was what&#39;s coming up for me and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.320" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">this is something that was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">with somebody earlier today here is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:15.370" style="s2">many of the things that I think have</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:19.030" style="s2">claimed themselves to be paradigm shifts</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.370" end="00:30:22.840" style="s2">are in fact simply like perhaps the last</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.030" end="00:30:25.390" style="s2">gasp of the mental rationale the mental</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.840" end="00:30:28.450" style="s2">rationale faculty attempting to push</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.390" end="00:30:30.160" style="s2">itself beyond what its limits are right</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.450" end="00:30:33.910" style="s2">so like integral for instance like for</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.160" end="00:30:37.450" style="s2">me it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the mental</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.910" end="00:30:39.450" style="s2">rational mind trying to go beyond itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.450" end="00:30:42.810" style="s2">but really it&#39;s just creating like more</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.450" end="00:30:45.660" style="s2">more complexity more mental rational</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.810" end="00:30:48.220" style="s2">accoutrements and descriptions of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.660" end="00:30:49.750" style="s2">exactly that thing which perhaps created</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.220" end="00:30:52.210" style="s2">the context in which we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.750" end="00:30:55.510" style="s2">that needs to be moved beyond and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.210" end="00:30:57.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like there is a way in which all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.510" end="00:31:00.999" style="s2">these kind of meta theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.580" end="00:31:03.460" style="s2">moves aren&#39;t the thing there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.999" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">else that is coming online that I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.460" end="00:31:11.049" style="s2">is for me is this more like</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:13.269" style="s2">participatory embodied recognition of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.049" end="00:31:16.059" style="s2">difference in the nature of the human</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.269" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">being and they kind of like living</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.059" end="00:31:20.830" style="s2">forward of that and so yeah that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.450" end="00:31:23.860" style="s2">came to mind yeah that&#39;s really well</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.830" end="00:31:26.259" style="s2">said and and I think in looking at like</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.860" end="00:31:29.169" style="s2">where&#39;s dude where&#39;s my paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.259" end="00:31:31.210" style="s2">it&#39;s tempting to just look at that from</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.169" end="00:31:32.529" style="s2">this holistic like wins everything going</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.210" end="00:31:33.970" style="s2">to change but I think it&#39;s been this</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.529" end="00:31:37.090" style="s2">little pop Corning of the breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.970" end="00:31:38.379" style="s2">rational thinking in the exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.090" end="00:31:40.840" style="s2">other possibilities that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.379" end="00:31:42.789" style="s2">happening for the past 60 years or</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.840" end="00:31:45.070" style="s2">whatever and it just seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.789" end="00:31:46.659" style="s2">nothing&#39;s changing but we can&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.070" end="00:31:48.249" style="s2">forward in time and define what it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.659" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">that we&#39;re becoming but you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.249" end="00:31:55.659" style="s2">definitely tell by looking back that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:57.489" style="s2">this is different you know yeah I I like</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.659" end="00:32:00.129" style="s2">that I really like that reference to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.489" end="00:32:03.009" style="s2">integral like the sense of and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.129" end="00:32:05.889" style="s2">this is a real issue in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.009" end="00:32:08.429" style="s2">broader space and there&#39;s people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.889" end="00:32:10.600" style="s2">talking about meta modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.429" end="00:32:13.769" style="s2">integral obviously has a place within it</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.600" end="00:32:17.080" style="s2">is the danger of just further</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.769" end="00:32:20.289" style="s2">intellectualizing a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.080" end="00:32:22.179" style="s2">actually the end of intellectualizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.289" end="00:32:24.220" style="s2">and I think the right the rational mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.179" end="00:32:26.230" style="s2">has to be integrated like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.220" end="00:32:27.820" style="s2">also in in the more sort of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.230" end="00:32:29.889" style="s2">space there&#39;s a real denigration of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.820" end="00:32:32.230" style="s2">intellectual as well which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.889" end="00:32:34.090" style="s2">another dead end and I&#39;ve had these sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.230" end="00:32:36.700" style="s2">of conversations or it&#39;s like well just</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.090" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">stop thinking about it and just just</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.700" end="00:32:40.090" style="s2">just be present with your body and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:43.119" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the New Age spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.090" end="00:32:45.369" style="s2">bypass like there is a yes and move but</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.119" end="00:32:47.289" style="s2">what I definitely see in these circles</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.369" end="00:32:49.629" style="s2">happening again and again and again is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.289" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">just more sophisticated intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.629" end="00:32:55.239" style="s2">ways of kind of the mind trying to free</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:58.169" style="s2">itself from itself and it&#39;s just weaving</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.239" end="00:33:02.350" style="s2">ever deeper webs of abstraction and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.169" end="00:33:03.730" style="s2">word salad nonsense yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.350" end="00:33:05.350" style="s2">fascinating dynamic which is I guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.730" end="00:33:06.520" style="s2">bring us back to the point we made at</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.350" end="00:33:08.890" style="s2">the beginning about practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.520" end="00:33:11.740" style="s2">practice being primary and the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.890" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">being primary I find what the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.740" end="00:33:14.920" style="s2">of conversations I have with people if</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:17.470" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna use the integral model at</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.920" end="00:33:18.910" style="s2">Green level criticizing past levels and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.470" end="00:33:19.660" style="s2">saying stop thinking with the ration or</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.910" end="00:33:21.190" style="s2">stop thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.660" end="00:33:23.590" style="s2">don&#39;t use the rational framework so much</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.190" end="00:33:24.970" style="s2">that type of speech is never going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.590" end="00:33:30.460" style="s2">work for someone who&#39;s hyper-rational</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.970" end="00:33:32.620" style="s2">but there are kind of codes or like kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.460" end="00:33:34.990" style="s2">of instigating thought forms that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.620" end="00:33:36.520" style="s2">bring a rational person out of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.990" end="00:33:39.100" style="s2">rational way of thinking that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.520" end="00:33:40.360" style="s2">completely rationally based I had a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.100" end="00:33:42.130" style="s2">conversation with someone yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.360" end="00:33:43.690" style="s2">about this you know we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.130" end="00:33:45.460" style="s2">about synchronicity he&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.690" end="00:33:47.470" style="s2">I&#39;m a physicist there&#39;s no basis for any</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.460" end="00:33:50.310" style="s2">of this stuff and then I was like well</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.470" end="00:33:52.690" style="s2">you&#39;re basing everything off of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.310" end="00:33:54.430" style="s2">handful of miracles at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.690" end="00:33:55.900" style="s2">time and then everything is just locked</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.430" end="00:33:57.910" style="s2">into materialism from there</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.900" end="00:34:00.490" style="s2">it&#39;s like but we all have to agree that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.910" end="00:34:02.650" style="s2">we don&#39;t know for sure anything and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.490" end="00:34:04.660" style="s2">have to have the mental agility to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.650" end="00:34:05.980" style="s2">able to experiment with new ideas and if</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.660" end="00:34:07.000" style="s2">you&#39;re locked in this rational framework</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.980" end="00:34:09.490" style="s2">you&#39;re not even going to bother</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.000" end="00:34:11.590" style="s2">exploring these other ideas so you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.490" end="00:34:14.679" style="s2">bringing up the double-slit experiment</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.590" end="00:34:17.230" style="s2">or you know just daily experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.679" end="00:34:18.970" style="s2">unexplainable synchronicity being the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.230" end="00:34:20.620" style="s2">example it&#39;s like these are little</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.970" end="00:34:22.510" style="s2">things that can break people out of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.620" end="00:34:26.710" style="s2">rational framework that maybe they can</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.510" end="00:34:29.290" style="s2">start to just question but rationality</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.710" end="00:34:31.600" style="s2">and that orange level thinking has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.290" end="00:34:34.870" style="s2">tendency of confining people&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.600" end="00:34:37.179" style="s2">yeah I find it peculiar the physicist</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.870" end="00:34:40.899" style="s2">because physics has turned into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.179" end="00:34:43.060" style="s2">one of the most bizarre almost spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.899" end="00:34:45.220" style="s2">like so many of the of the great</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.060" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">physicists were were fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.220" end="00:34:49.990" style="s2">Eastern mysticism by the fact that one</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:52.780" style="s2">thing can be two things at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.990" end="00:34:55.030" style="s2">and this sense of physics as I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.780" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">my narrative of it in the 20s was that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.030" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">it kind of was like we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:34:59.950" style="s2">identify the fundamental building block</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:02.590" style="s2">of reality oh no it&#39;s looking back at us</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.950" end="00:35:05.380" style="s2">and that almost like pulling the pulling</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.590" end="00:35:07.900" style="s2">the rug under a certainty that then kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.380" end="00:35:09.670" style="s2">of framed like the twenty was amazed</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.900" end="00:35:12.340" style="s2">amazed entire yet psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.670" end="00:35:14.080" style="s2">starting he had incredible realizations</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.340" end="00:35:16.090" style="s2">in physics and it was it would when the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.080" end="00:35:17.830" style="s2">sort of the rug was being pulled and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.090" end="00:35:22.570" style="s2">pulled from underneath the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.830" end="00:35:24.700" style="s2">mental rational atomistic framework and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.570" end="00:35:26.920" style="s2">so I find it bizarre that a physicist</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.700" end="00:35:28.390" style="s2">would say would kind of how physicists</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.920" end="00:35:30.520" style="s2">could still be a kind of arch</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.390" end="00:35:31.810" style="s2">materialist well you know he&#39;s that he</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.520" end="00:35:33.730" style="s2">was a physicist who was also a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.810" end="00:35:34.840" style="s2">rationalist and you can you can be one</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.730" end="00:35:37.330" style="s2">of the other you don&#39;t have to be both</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.840" end="00:35:39.790" style="s2">and embedded in like our current culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.330" end="00:35:41.740" style="s2">and like raised up in our public</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.790" end="00:35:43.450" style="s2">education or education systems and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.740" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">subject to our economy you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.450" end="00:35:47.050" style="s2">it is kind of like to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:49.450" style="s2">participating in the reification of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.050" end="00:35:51.780" style="s2">kind of paradigm and so it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.450" end="00:35:55.420" style="s2">you know maybe one one stream is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.780" end="00:35:59.070" style="s2">sort of problematizing it but it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.420" end="00:36:02.170" style="s2">of work I think we it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.070" end="00:36:04.270" style="s2">overestimate to the degree to which the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.170" end="00:36:07.720" style="s2">mental rationale will kind of like hold</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.270" end="00:36:11.980" style="s2">on to its paradigm and it&#39;s hard to like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.720" end="00:36:16.180" style="s2">it it&#39;s easy I think to because we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.980" end="00:36:18.850" style="s2">talk about it it&#39;s hard it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.180" end="00:36:20.980" style="s2">incredibly hard to move beyond it even</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.850" end="00:36:25.090" style="s2">for like brief periods of time and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.980" end="00:36:26.620" style="s2">like oh yeah one thing I notice about</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.090" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">people who are stuck in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.620" end="00:36:31.900" style="s2">materialistic rational perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:34.630" style="s2">they they have this desire for certainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.900" end="00:36:37.090" style="s2">for kind of a binary answer right but</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.630" end="00:36:38.920" style="s2">they they tend to talk about it as if</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.090" end="00:36:41.800" style="s2">that&#39;s coming from their framework</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.920" end="00:36:43.810" style="s2">instead of which I&#39;m observing to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.800" end="00:36:46.390" style="s2">more of an emotional response to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.810" end="00:36:48.100" style="s2">uncertainty not knowing the way things</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.390" end="00:36:49.900" style="s2">are we have this desire because it gives</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.100" end="00:36:52.150" style="s2">us a feeling of safety to know something</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.900" end="00:36:54.520" style="s2">is a certain way and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.150" end="00:37:00.940" style="s2">rational rationalist or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.520" end="00:37:03.940" style="s2">want to call them tend to use the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.940" end="00:37:06.370" style="s2">rational framework as a crutch</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.940" end="00:37:08.110" style="s2">like it must be proven for me to even</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.370" end="00:37:13.600" style="s2">experiment with the idea and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.110" end="00:37:15.930" style="s2">completely limiting yeah that&#39;s a dead</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.600" end="00:37:15.930" style="s2">end too</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.130" end="00:37:28.310" style="s2">wandering in maybe going into a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.700" end="00:37:33.110" style="s2">bit of a sort of what&#39;s the experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.310" end="00:37:34.670" style="s2">been for us in terms of kind of I love</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.110" end="00:37:36.260" style="s2">again referring to Peter Lindbergh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.670" end="00:37:38.810" style="s2">idea of kind of memetic artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.260" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this sort of sense of where he</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.810" end="00:37:42.470" style="s2">had was he said something like we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:44.060" style="s2">sending out mimetic artifacts into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.470" end="00:37:46.550" style="s2">void and seeing what comes back and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.060" end="00:37:48.200" style="s2">there has been a real sense of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.550" end="00:37:50.390" style="s2">interest in the stuff that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.200" end="00:37:52.550" style="s2">bringing out we&#39;re putting out and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.390" end="00:37:53.750" style="s2">know I&#39;m sure you have the same thing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.550" end="00:37:55.100" style="s2">lot of people getting in touch and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.750" end="00:37:58.730" style="s2">of people following this sort of same</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.100" end="00:38:02.750" style="s2">thread of the emerging conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.730" end="00:38:05.270" style="s2">mean how how has that been for for you</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.750" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">guys I mean especially for Daniel being</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.270" end="00:38:09.470" style="s2">in a monastery and then also being</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:14.030" style="s2">putting all of this sort of content out</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.470" end="00:38:16.220" style="s2">and the paradox of being kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.030" end="00:38:18.350" style="s2">monastery but also now in in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.220" end="00:38:19.730" style="s2">of interconnected world being available</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.350" end="00:38:21.860" style="s2">for anyone to kind of get in contact</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.730" end="00:38:25.340" style="s2">it&#39;s partially available I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.860" end="00:38:26.840" style="s2">like sort of like not intentionally like</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.340" end="00:38:27.590" style="s2">there&#39;s no comments you can make on my</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.840" end="00:38:30.440" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.590" end="00:38:32.120" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not on YouTube I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.440" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">a website really I&#39;m part of this larger</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.120" end="00:38:36.710" style="s2">brand is actually kind of hard to get in</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.210" style="s2">touch with me we&#39;re gonna put Daniels</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.710" end="00:38:41.810" style="s2">email address oh that&#39;s great right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.210" end="00:38:43.130" style="s2">but but nonetheless people do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.810" end="00:38:45.380" style="s2">actually hard because I feel like I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.130" end="00:38:47.120" style="s2">to like give more to them but I live in</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.380" end="00:38:50.420" style="s2">a monastery I live in a monastery and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.120" end="00:38:55.010" style="s2">like you know I have my time is all very</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.420" end="00:38:56.750" style="s2">spoken for but the sense that I get and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.010" end="00:38:59.330" style="s2">I imagine this is true for all of us is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.750" end="00:39:01.640" style="s2">that we&#39;re like we are putting out a</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.330" end="00:39:04.220" style="s2">signal that is creating some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.640" end="00:39:05.960" style="s2">resonant field that people are like</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.220" end="00:39:07.670" style="s2">feeling drawn into that they want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.960" end="00:39:09.350" style="s2">participate in that they want more from</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.670" end="00:39:13.640" style="s2">like there&#39;s some pathos there like they</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.350" end="00:39:17.540" style="s2">want there to be more and it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.640" end="00:39:21.460" style="s2">it&#39;s humbling for me that&#39;s super cool</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.540" end="00:39:21.460" style="s2">to be a part of like I feel really lucky</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.500" end="00:39:26.430" style="s2">being that we&#39;re out in Bulgaria I feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.940" end="00:39:28.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like self-exiled probably feel some</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.430" end="00:39:33.480" style="s2">of the similar similar situation for you</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.920" end="00:39:34.589" style="s2">and it&#39;s some it often feels like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.480" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">just shouting out into the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.589" end="00:39:38.490" style="s2">shouting these ideas out and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:41.940" style="s2">people are hearing them maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.490" end="00:39:44.250" style="s2">not but the fact that you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.940" end="00:39:45.960" style="s2">said earlier but that having all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.250" end="00:39:47.609" style="s2">these different subjects and talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.960" end="00:39:50.099" style="s2">about whatever you feel whatever feels</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.609" end="00:39:52.230" style="s2">like is emerging and interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.099" end="00:39:53.730" style="s2">just fascinating to me how people are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.230" end="00:39:55.980" style="s2">picking up on a narrative that was never</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.730" end="00:39:57.030" style="s2">intended and that&#39;s the same thing I</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.980" end="00:39:58.650" style="s2">think that we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.030" end="00:40:00.089" style="s2">there is some sort of narrative that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.650" end="00:40:01.829" style="s2">just happening while all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.089" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">are seeming to simultaneously bubbling</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.829" end="00:40:05.550" style="s2">up around us the one thread I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:08.460" style="s2">pick up from from our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.550" end="00:40:11.579" style="s2">before which is integration because we</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.460" end="00:40:13.800" style="s2">mentioned peak experiences and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.579" end="00:40:17.220" style="s2">those are incredibly valuable but I also</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.800" end="00:40:22.260" style="s2">think that what a lot like my personal</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.220" end="00:40:23.819" style="s2">journey has been very much and I find it</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.260" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">quite easy to have those peak</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.819" end="00:40:28.280" style="s2">experiences and my personal journey of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:31.079" style="s2">kind of integrating that into my life</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.280" end="00:40:32.670" style="s2">has been a long a long one I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.079" end="00:40:34.619" style="s2">that&#39;s really valuable to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.670" end="00:40:36.390" style="s2">like what is the what are the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.619" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">hard yards of integration of these kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.390" end="00:40:43.140" style="s2">of peak ego dissolving experiences in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">hard hard hard yards hard yards yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.140" end="00:40:48.299" style="s2">this position was I mean that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">American thing never know yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.299" end="00:40:52.859" style="s2">a Canadian thing the difficult work oh I</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:54.990" style="s2">think okay hard yards I I&#39;m sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.859" end="00:41:03.450" style="s2">American it&#39;s not the sort of thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.990" end="00:41:06.900" style="s2">say yeah and just I mean one one thread</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.450" end="00:41:08.760" style="s2">is well I became a kind of workshop</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.900" end="00:41:10.859" style="s2">junkie I did I did sort of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.760" end="00:41:14.579" style="s2">plant medicines psychedelics at</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.859" end="00:41:15.750" style="s2">university had huge openings there that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.579" end="00:41:17.309" style="s2">I actually found quite difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.750" end="00:41:19.980" style="s2">integrate and went through a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.309" end="00:41:23.309" style="s2">real dark night of the soul experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.980" end="00:41:24.990" style="s2">afterwards and sense of that the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.309" end="00:41:27.690" style="s2">I came up with was living in the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.990" end="00:41:30.320" style="s2">of myself because I had this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.690" end="00:41:34.140" style="s2">taste of have really been</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.320" end="00:41:36.510" style="s2">really tapping into a bigger version of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.140" end="00:41:39.510" style="s2">myself and then that was unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.510" end="00:41:41.130" style="s2">through through the psychedelics and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.510" end="00:41:43.290" style="s2">was sort of chasing that thing for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.130" end="00:41:45.870" style="s2">while and the gap between that and my</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.290" end="00:41:47.820" style="s2">myself was kind of opening up and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.870" end="00:41:51.690" style="s2">when I found the more personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.820" end="00:41:54.600" style="s2">oriented work I I found I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.690" end="00:41:56.040" style="s2">access some of the same experience but</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.600" end="00:41:59.400" style="s2">it was much more into I found it more</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.040" end="00:42:01.020" style="s2">easy to integrate but it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.400" end="00:42:03.120" style="s2">think I really was able to integrate it</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.020" end="00:42:05.550" style="s2">until I had more of those relationships</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.120" end="00:42:08.760" style="s2">in my life like I was playing with being</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.550" end="00:42:10.410" style="s2">more honest or being more yeah playing</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.760" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">with with greater depth and greater</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.410" end="00:42:14.670" style="s2">honesty in the workshop space but it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">wasn&#39;t until I&#39;d say that more of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.670" end="00:42:17.970" style="s2">relationships in my outside and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:20.250" style="s2">outside world had that quality of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.970" end="00:42:24.390" style="s2">presence and honesty and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.250" end="00:42:26.790" style="s2">connection that I felt more integrated</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.390" end="00:42:31.530" style="s2">and this sort of I think part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.790" end="00:42:33.810" style="s2">also the the illusion of isolation or</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.530" end="00:42:35.400" style="s2">individuality it&#39;s actually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.810" end="00:42:36.660" style="s2">actually highly networked and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.400" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">through the quality of those connections</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.660" end="00:42:41.100" style="s2">and quality of those interactions that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:43.020" style="s2">can we change those through like</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.100" end="00:42:44.910" style="s2">authentic relating or circling or any of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.020" end="00:42:46.740" style="s2">those more deeper present practices</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.910" end="00:42:50.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what really I think make a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.740" end="00:42:51.660" style="s2">sustainable change it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.010" end="00:42:52.830" style="s2">individual peak State experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.660" end="00:42:53.880" style="s2">when we&#39;re like okay now I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.830" end="00:42:55.650" style="s2">change everything in my life and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.880" end="00:42:57.660" style="s2">everything&#39;s gonna be different but then</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.650" end="00:43:00.090" style="s2">kind of we come down over the course for</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.660" end="00:43:01.980" style="s2">a month or two yeah yeah yeah I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.090" end="00:43:03.270" style="s2">there&#39;s that saying I think like Tim</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.980" end="00:43:04.530" style="s2">Ferriss says it&#39;s a lot but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.270" end="00:43:06.060" style="s2">you are the average of the five people</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.530" end="00:43:07.290" style="s2">you spend the most time with usually</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.060" end="00:43:08.940" style="s2">it&#39;s used in the context of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.290" end="00:43:13.110" style="s2">entrepreneurship and like being</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.940" end="00:43:16.200" style="s2">materially successful but like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.110" end="00:43:16.860" style="s2">right like it&#39;s there&#39;s a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.200" end="00:43:19.260" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.860" end="00:43:21.450" style="s2">I think people in general are virulent</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.260" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">in a lot of ways that we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.450" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">recognize and to find yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:26.310" style="s2">commune like that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:27.990" style="s2">I&#39;m in a monastery is like everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.310" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">just like completely dedicating</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.990" end="00:43:32.250" style="s2">themselves to growth and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:35.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge transition point when your</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.250" end="00:43:36.750" style="s2">social network starts to shift and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.010" end="00:43:38.370" style="s2">find yourself in in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.750" end="00:43:41.510" style="s2">people who are like up to the same game</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.370" end="00:43:43.559" style="s2">and they&#39;re not like isolated anymore</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.510" end="00:43:45.829" style="s2">you know my sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.559" end="00:43:48.599" style="s2">in terms of like the hard part yards of</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.829" end="00:43:50.430" style="s2">this kind of thing is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.599" end="00:43:51.809" style="s2">different for every person and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.430" end="00:43:54.479" style="s2">it&#39;s like what you say at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.809" end="00:43:56.549" style="s2">that it&#39;s about following your like</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.479" end="00:43:59.299" style="s2">interest your curiosity is pulling you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.549" end="00:44:01.890" style="s2">like I started with like you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.299" end="00:44:03.150" style="s2">intensive meditation retreats other</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.890" end="00:44:05.609" style="s2">people I know started with like</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.150" end="00:44:07.229" style="s2">therapeutic kind of more trauma healing</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.609" end="00:44:08.819" style="s2">and then later came to meditation other</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.229" end="00:44:11.969" style="s2">people I know started with psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.819" end="00:44:14.910" style="s2">right but like there&#39;s a way in which if</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.969" end="00:44:17.219" style="s2">you keep going it will just like it will</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.910" end="00:44:20.039" style="s2">it will touch every arena of your life</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.219" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">and like letting that go down right like</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.039" end="00:44:23.999" style="s2">letting it just consume everything over</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:27.829" style="s2">time and not like being like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.999" end="00:44:30.769" style="s2">just like just meditation right just</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.829" end="00:44:33.779" style="s2">authentic relating like allow it to keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.769" end="00:44:36.089" style="s2">growing and consuming you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.779" end="00:44:37.859" style="s2">probably like pretty it&#39;s gonna do what</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.089" end="00:44:41.189" style="s2">it does you know like it worked its way</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.859" end="00:44:44.309" style="s2">yeah you know it&#39;s it&#39;s funny I agree</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.189" end="00:44:46.559" style="s2">with you that there is a some place that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.309" end="00:44:49.499" style="s2">you kind of arrived at but you can go to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.559" end="00:44:51.239" style="s2">go to it from different areas and for me</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.499" end="00:44:53.339" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;ve had rope tied around my</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.239" end="00:44:55.199" style="s2">legs and been thrown off the back of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.339" end="00:44:57.900" style="s2">car and dragged through all of it the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.199" end="00:44:59.609" style="s2">whole way and and not so I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.900" end="00:45:02.279" style="s2">see it throughout their lenses of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.609" end="00:45:03.630" style="s2">intentional practice or you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.279" end="00:45:07.369" style="s2">of it was just like no you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.630" end="00:45:09.989" style="s2">life is dragging you through this but</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.369" end="00:45:12.179" style="s2">there was an interview that I watched</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.989" end="00:45:14.099" style="s2">with Jordan Peterson where he described</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.179" end="00:45:17.160" style="s2">his own kind of awakening experience and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.099" end="00:45:20.130" style="s2">it had to do with with recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.160" end="00:45:23.369" style="s2">voice outside of his his own narrating</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.130" end="00:45:25.559" style="s2">voice that looked at him speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.369" end="00:45:27.989" style="s2">said that&#39;s not true that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.559" end="00:45:30.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t mean that and I when I heard</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.989" end="00:45:32.130" style="s2">him say that I really resonated with</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.660" end="00:45:33.779" style="s2">that it was something that I went</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.130" end="00:45:36.150" style="s2">through a very distinct period of of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.779" end="00:45:38.569" style="s2">like recognizing how much was</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.150" end="00:45:40.890" style="s2">just coming out of my face and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.569" end="00:45:41.999" style="s2">recognizing the narrator and recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.890" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.999" end="00:45:48.269" style="s2">part of me that is criticizing and so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:50.369" style="s2">really made a practice out of just</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.269" end="00:45:52.739" style="s2">figuring out what that voice was and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.369" end="00:45:54.660" style="s2">that really was a transition point for</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.739" end="00:45:56.520" style="s2">me like everything cascaded out of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.660" end="00:45:58.680" style="s2">and I I stopped getting dragged through</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.520" end="00:46:00.870" style="s2">the mud after that point you know like</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.680" end="00:46:01.890" style="s2">in it relates to that attractor thing I</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.870" end="00:46:03.990" style="s2">think life just gives you the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.890" end="00:46:06.660" style="s2">circumstances you need to learn to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.990" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">able to to grow as a person some people</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.660" end="00:46:10.320" style="s2">need a lot of suffering and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">my case but as soon as I gained</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.320" end="00:46:15.180" style="s2">sovereignty in my own personal growth I</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:16.710" style="s2">stopped suffering which is amazing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.180" end="00:46:17.910" style="s2">yeah well one thing that&#39;s coming up too</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.710" end="00:46:22.380" style="s2">is I think we talked about this a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.910" end="00:46:27.630" style="s2">bit yesterday is one kind of mmm what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.380" end="00:46:30.180" style="s2">this like place or pull you must pass on</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.630" end="00:46:33.120" style="s2">this I think is whether or not you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.180" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">been thoroughly humiliated right like</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.120" end="00:46:36.780" style="s2">and I I mean like intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:40.350" style="s2">emotionally like that your whole being</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.780" end="00:46:43.350" style="s2">has just been humiliated I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.350" end="00:46:46.350" style="s2">for me is actual indicator of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.350" end="00:46:48.540" style="s2">like this person is trustworthy because</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.350" end="00:46:51.390" style="s2">otherwise they&#39;re wrong they think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.540" end="00:46:54.210" style="s2">they you need to have been broken by</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.390" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">life in some way yeah yeah yeah and like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.210" end="00:46:59.400" style="s2">this constantly trying to break you and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:47:02.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like let it yeah that&#39;s such a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.400" end="00:47:06.780" style="s2">point I mean have you read that book the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.220" end="00:47:08.850" style="s2">surrender experiment yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.780" end="00:47:13.950" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do that just do any talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.850" end="00:47:14.580" style="s2">about what&#39;s what so it was a guy</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.950" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">Michael</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.580" end="00:47:19.590" style="s2">a singer who wanted to just be a monk</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:21.120" style="s2">basically he wanted to disappear away</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.590" end="00:47:23.550" style="s2">from the world not have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.120" end="00:47:25.950" style="s2">world and just focus on you know self</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.550" end="00:47:27.810" style="s2">transcendence and and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.950" end="00:47:29.340" style="s2">thing and there are so many things</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.810" end="00:47:30.750" style="s2">around him constantly demanding his</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.340" end="00:47:32.520" style="s2">attention you know he was teaching in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.750" end="00:47:34.560" style="s2">university and he wanted to stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.520" end="00:47:35.730" style="s2">all of that buy a plot of land out in</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.560" end="00:47:37.650" style="s2">the middle of nowhere and just go there</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.730" end="00:47:39.210" style="s2">and I I also recognize myself in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.650" end="00:47:40.710" style="s2">too because I just went what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.210" end="00:47:42.810" style="s2">farthest place in the world I could go</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.710" end="00:47:46.440" style="s2">to well Gary up sure let&#39;s go there and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.810" end="00:47:48.300" style="s2">I never came out but one thing he did</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.440" end="00:47:50.070" style="s2">that was really inspiring to me is he</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.300" end="00:47:51.690" style="s2">said yes to so many things is like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.070" end="00:47:54.330" style="s2">yes man movie with Jim Carrey like he</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.690" end="00:47:56.850" style="s2">just kept saying yes and he went through</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.330" end="00:47:58.530" style="s2">just an amazing set of experiences I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.850" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">actually quite recall all of them aside</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.530" end="00:48:04.500" style="s2">from one where he became the CEO of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:05.940" style="s2">large software company somehow but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.500" end="00:48:07.369" style="s2">you remember some of the other stories I</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.940" end="00:48:10.220" style="s2">just kind of remember that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.369" end="00:48:13.460" style="s2">a sense of he&#39;s just like like humbling</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.220" end="00:48:15.619" style="s2">himself in into life like just allowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.460" end="00:48:17.240" style="s2">life to tell him what to do you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.619" end="00:48:18.619" style="s2">which is I think a little bit yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.240" end="00:48:22.910" style="s2">what I&#39;m referring to that there is like</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.619" end="00:48:24.670" style="s2">like yeah that&#39;s there&#39;s a humility that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.910" end="00:48:27.430" style="s2">requires I think a degree of humiliation</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.670" end="00:48:30.829" style="s2">typically given how we are typically</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.430" end="00:48:34.609" style="s2">educated in our world to allow that to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.829" end="00:48:37.339" style="s2">happen to you yeah I think you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.609" end="00:48:39.410" style="s2">the degree to which you are stubborn is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.339" end="00:48:41.539" style="s2">the degree to which life will bash it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.410" end="00:48:44.119" style="s2">over your head and and you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.539" end="00:48:45.950" style="s2">stubbornly rational which is why I also</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.119" end="00:48:47.480" style="s2">realized that any other talk but</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.950" end="00:48:50.059" style="s2">rational talk is not going to convince</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.480" end="00:48:51.829" style="s2">someone to transcend that but I was very</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.059" end="00:48:54.140" style="s2">stubborn so life kept hitting me with</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.829" end="00:48:55.849" style="s2">that yeah I think it like you say like</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.140" end="00:48:57.499" style="s2">it at the dark night like the dark for</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.849" end="00:48:59.210" style="s2">in a lot of cases maybe not all cases</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.499" end="00:49:01.400" style="s2">like the the length of the time you</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.210" end="00:49:03.380" style="s2">spend in the dark night is the length of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.400" end="00:49:05.720" style="s2">time you are unwilling to just humble</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.380" end="00:49:08.180" style="s2">yourself and let go right like when I</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.720" end="00:49:10.700" style="s2">first got to the monastery some years</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.180" end="00:49:12.859" style="s2">ago like that was basically what the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.700" end="00:49:15.230" style="s2">teacher there just was like making me do</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.859" end="00:49:18.200" style="s2">he&#39;s just like no like you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.230" end="00:49:21.739" style="s2">pretend you don&#39;t get to act as if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.200" end="00:49:24.650" style="s2">know here maybe a day in day out</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.739" end="00:49:25.190" style="s2">eventually you know I just it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.650" end="00:49:28.369" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.190" end="00:49:30.470" style="s2">I get I&#39;m really curious about that your</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.369" end="00:49:32.230" style="s2">experience there at the monastery cuz my</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.470" end="00:49:35.720" style="s2">experience has always been you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.230" end="00:49:37.069" style="s2">disappear and I do think a lot of at</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.720" end="00:49:39.410" style="s2">least the stories I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.069" end="00:49:41.989" style="s2">which is maybe part of my lens there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.410" end="00:49:43.400" style="s2">this period with big transformation</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.989" end="00:49:47.509" style="s2">there&#39;s this period of time of deep</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.400" end="00:49:49.220" style="s2">isolation and even exile from society</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.509" end="00:49:51.109" style="s2">and and reflection and contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.220" end="00:49:54.380" style="s2">it&#39;s the whole like Moses in the burning</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.109" end="00:49:56.589" style="s2">bush that whole kind of archetypal story</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.380" end="00:49:59.239" style="s2">is to me at the heart of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.589" end="00:50:00.769" style="s2">transformational stories so to have it</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.239" end="00:50:05.239" style="s2">be in a community setting is really</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.769" end="00:50:07.249" style="s2">foreign in really fascinating to me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.239" end="00:50:08.869" style="s2">yeah I mean I certainly think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.249" end="00:50:09.499" style="s2">case that like metaphorically that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.869" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.499" end="00:50:13.369" style="s2">certainly on retreat right like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:16.020" style="s2">all there together you&#39;re in the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.369" end="00:50:19.470" style="s2">space but you&#39;re completely alone</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.020" end="00:50:22.050" style="s2">right you&#39;re just in silence sitting 12</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.470" end="00:50:23.700" style="s2">hours a day or whatever and you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.050" end="00:50:25.710" style="s2">there is a kind of existential</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.700" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">loneliness that you certainly become</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.710" end="00:50:30.300" style="s2">extremely aware of in that setting and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:32.970" style="s2">think in general in the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.300" end="00:50:36.150" style="s2">container like you you&#39;re aware of how</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.970" end="00:50:37.740" style="s2">alone you are in this journey and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.150" end="00:50:39.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which that happens but</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.740" end="00:50:42.080" style="s2">you&#39;re certainly not like yeah you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.390" end="00:50:43.740" style="s2">surrounded by community for sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.080" end="00:50:45.600" style="s2">interesting I wouldn&#39;t have guessed that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.740" end="00:50:49.230" style="s2">that the experience would still be have</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.600" end="00:50:51.390" style="s2">that loneliness component to it yeah mmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.230" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.390" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">we came up with on our workshops we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">to do it ourselves but we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.510" style="s2">do it alone but there is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:02.490" style="s2">support I imagine at the at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.510" end="00:51:03.780" style="s2">monastery at least that that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.490" end="00:51:07.410" style="s2">you&#39;re with people who are on a similar</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.780" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">journey rather than you can&#39;t talk to</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.410" end="00:51:12.230" style="s2">about it yeah it means there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:15.210" style="s2">growing opening to our existential</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.230" end="00:51:18.060" style="s2">aloneness in at the same time a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.210" end="00:51:20.310" style="s2">deepening experience of belonging and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.060" end="00:51:23.369" style="s2">like community and mutuality and support</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.310" end="00:51:24.900" style="s2">and so those in the monastic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.369" end="00:51:27.750" style="s2">as I understand it like those two things</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.900" end="00:51:29.340" style="s2">together are part of that kind of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.750" end="00:51:31.650" style="s2">technology or whatever is it those two</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.340" end="00:51:33.930" style="s2">come together because one without the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.650" end="00:51:37.170" style="s2">other can create a lot of danger right</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.930" end="00:51:41.160" style="s2">well either like just hope like group</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.170" end="00:51:43.020" style="s2">mind or you know people who do go out on</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.160" end="00:51:45.240" style="s2">their own can</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.020" end="00:51:47.970" style="s2">yes break through have breakthroughs but</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.240" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">can also lose track of like ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.970" end="00:51:54.630" style="s2">behavior and how to behave in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:56.940" style="s2">respects the community I think the speed</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.630" end="00:51:59.070" style="s2">of awakening also seems to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.940" end="00:52:02.280" style="s2">affected by how surrounded by other</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.070" end="00:52:03.600" style="s2">practitioners you are I noticed I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.280" end="00:52:07.050" style="s2">at this event there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.600" end="00:52:09.359" style="s2">conversation about isolation and finding</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.050" end="00:52:11.910" style="s2">the others and you know where where are</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.359" end="00:52:13.260" style="s2">people and and I was in that bubble for</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.910" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">the longest time which is partially why</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.260" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">we started the podcast is just put up a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:19.590" style="s2">flag and see who comes and in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:22.170" style="s2">and then starting meetups which you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.590" end="00:52:24.030" style="s2">you guys understand this you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.170" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a hunger for this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.030" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">content and conversation and camaraderie</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:29.590" style="s2">that you know to me the realization came</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:31.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.590" end="00:52:33.250" style="s2">late and I think for a lot about other</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.360" end="00:52:35.470" style="s2">people it hasn&#39;t come yet they just</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.250" end="00:52:38.230" style="s2">think they&#39;re alone in this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.470" end="00:52:41.230" style="s2">they&#39;re really not it&#39;s really we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.230" end="00:52:43.630" style="s2">all so special you know our experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.230" end="00:52:45.430" style="s2">is that whole thing like you&#39;re special</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.630" end="00:52:48.040" style="s2">you can do anything you want I actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.430" end="00:52:50.110" style="s2">think works against us we&#39;re so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.040" end="00:52:53.110" style="s2">more like with each other than me than</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.110" end="00:52:55.450" style="s2">we think and in recognizing that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.110" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s instant community you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.450" end="00:53:01.000" style="s2">exceptionalism is a real prison of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:02.710" style="s2">isolation yeah yeah you&#39;re touching on</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.000" end="00:53:05.160" style="s2">two really interesting subjects that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.710" end="00:53:07.840" style="s2">is community which is something I feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.160" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">certainly we&#39;re now focusing more and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.840" end="00:53:13.420" style="s2">more on how do we build community and</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">also the sort of difference both of you</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.420" end="00:53:20.080" style="s2">are kind of in self-imposed isolation in</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:22.090" style="s2">a way and we&#39;re based in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.080" end="00:53:25.240" style="s2">London one of the the kind of biggest</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.090" end="00:53:29.860" style="s2">cities and it&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.240" end="00:53:31.090" style="s2">like I I feel there&#39;s part of me that</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.860" end="00:53:32.140" style="s2">would that would love to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.090" end="00:53:33.820" style="s2">living somewhere in the country</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.140" end="00:53:36.190" style="s2">countryside and part of me that feels</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.820" end="00:53:43.780" style="s2">like that&#39;s just impossible that the it</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.190" end="00:53:46.030" style="s2">I feel like really a real need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.780" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">what I feel to be one of the centres of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.030" end="00:53:51.940" style="s2">things and I mean the UK is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">kind of centralized country that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.940" end="00:53:55.320" style="s2">everything is focused on London the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:57.610" style="s2">media industry is focused on Londa</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.320" end="00:53:59.860" style="s2">politics like everything exists in</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.610" end="00:54:04.060" style="s2">London ice is really centralized place</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.860" end="00:54:05.590" style="s2">and like I love the sound of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.060" end="00:54:08.860" style="s2">monastery for example I couldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.590" end="00:54:10.270" style="s2">couldn&#39;t imagine living there I think I</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.860" end="00:54:11.770" style="s2">couldn&#39;t imagine taking that time out</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.270" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">like I feel the sense of urgency of</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.770" end="00:54:16.660" style="s2">needing to be in a kind of Center - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:18.490" style="s2">well we talked about I think a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.660" end="00:54:20.740" style="s2">bit about this yesterday right I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.490" end="00:54:22.450" style="s2">there&#39;s um as we encounter each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.740" end="00:54:24.130" style="s2">work there&#39;s a way in which I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.450" end="00:54:26.890" style="s2">we&#39;re finding out like what is ours to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.130" end="00:54:29.830" style="s2">do in this sort of ecosystem and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.890" end="00:54:31.030" style="s2">like I don&#39;t want that like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.830" end="00:54:34.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to like wade into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.030" end="00:54:37.120" style="s2">culture war and and like like show</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.180" end="00:54:39.130" style="s2">people how to have conversations or</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.120" end="00:54:41.750" style="s2">whatever like that that just does not</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.130" end="00:54:44.050" style="s2">appeal to me personally I&#39;m real and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.750" end="00:54:47.870" style="s2">know that like somebody better do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.050" end="00:54:48.920" style="s2">somebody better do that yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.870" end="00:54:53.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good point I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.920" end="00:54:55.190" style="s2">that is my piece to hold is what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.540" end="00:54:56.510" style="s2">sort of memetic mediation between</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.190" end="00:54:58.730" style="s2">different tribes or at least seeing</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.510" end="00:55:00.710" style="s2">where where the different tribes are who</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.730" end="00:55:02.870" style="s2">the liminal figures or figures who might</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.710" end="00:55:04.640" style="s2">be able to reach between these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.870" end="00:55:07.340" style="s2">warring tribes might be and then to try</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.640" end="00:55:08.890" style="s2">and do interviews with them like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.340" end="00:55:11.450" style="s2">something I feel really drawn towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.890" end="00:55:12.980" style="s2">actually that puts into perspective a</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.450" end="00:55:15.350" style="s2">lot of the previous conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.980" end="00:55:17.300" style="s2">conversations we&#39;ve had like you and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.350" end="00:55:19.370" style="s2">would say Peter Lindbergh have a really</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.300" end="00:55:22.250" style="s2">solid understanding of the landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.370" end="00:55:24.050" style="s2">tribes that that I have no idea no clue</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.250" end="00:55:28.610" style="s2">about and maybe you&#39;re on the same page</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.050" end="00:55:30.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.610" end="00:55:32.750" style="s2">think you you make a sacrifice by being</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.920" end="00:55:34.490" style="s2">there but also getting that exposure</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.750" end="00:55:36.380" style="s2">like I walk into London no offense to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.490" end="00:55:38.830" style="s2">any of Londoners there but I need to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.380" end="00:55:41.750" style="s2">out immediately I cannot stay there and</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.830" end="00:55:43.310" style="s2">you know you&#39;re immersed there so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.750" end="00:55:44.600" style="s2">there are some downsides to it for you</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.310" end="00:55:47.270" style="s2">is it that you haven&#39;t expressed but</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.600" end="00:55:48.920" style="s2">you&#39;re the ability that you have to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.270" end="00:55:51.950" style="s2">the full landscape of tribes I find</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.920" end="00:55:53.030" style="s2">fascinating and Peter you know just</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.950" end="00:55:56.560" style="s2">probably as much to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.030" end="00:56:00.080" style="s2">journalistic background as as anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.560" end="00:56:01.310" style="s2">yeah yes I was seeing where the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.080" end="00:56:03.890" style="s2">are coming from and seeing what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.310" end="00:56:05.210" style="s2">cultural landscape is and where the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.890" end="00:56:07.580" style="s2">pressure points might be on that</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.210" end="00:56:10.970" style="s2">landscape I think is is kind of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.580" end="00:56:12.800" style="s2">interested in it could be a matter of my</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.970" end="00:56:14.900" style="s2">ignorance but I keep when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.800" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">tribes though I also think the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.900" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">still all the same that there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:23.420" style="s2">this hyper identification with your</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:25.070" style="s2">tribe and and with ideas and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.420" end="00:56:27.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not one thing it&#39;s another and if</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.070" end="00:56:29.930" style="s2">one thought for more one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.140" end="00:56:31.550" style="s2">identity or developmental level is</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.930" end="00:56:35.180" style="s2">breaking down you just swing over to</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.550" end="00:56:37.460" style="s2">another one and continue there and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.180" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s if part of the fuel for me not to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.460" end="00:56:41.510" style="s2">come into the tribal conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:44.780" style="s2">because it seems like the solution</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.510" end="00:56:46.190" style="s2">should is just go into isolation Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.780" end="00:56:49.250" style="s2">Peterson says clean up your room go</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.190" end="00:56:51.320" style="s2">focus on fixing your own life and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.250" end="00:56:54.770" style="s2">go out into the world and maybe don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.320" end="00:56:58.580" style="s2">join any tribes just just be</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.770" end="00:57:00.740" style="s2">with what are your thoughts on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.580" end="00:57:03.369" style="s2">I mean expect I feel this particularly</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.740" end="00:57:08.750" style="s2">in terms of the American political</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.369" end="00:57:11.750" style="s2">context that and we&#39;ve I feel like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.750" end="00:57:15.320" style="s2">sort of gone in a little bit every I</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.750" end="00:57:17.330" style="s2">feel a real sense of if I&#39;m gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.320" end="00:57:20.780" style="s2">sitting down and having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.330" end="00:57:22.460" style="s2">with people who are deeply immersed and</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.780" end="00:57:24.860" style="s2">there&#39;s so much heat and there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.460" end="00:57:25.910" style="s2">some this some heat sunlight as well but</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.860" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of heat in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.910" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">conversation and I look at these</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:35.690" style="s2">political channels that have like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:42.730" style="s2">million followers or and and it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.690" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">I feel like the meta conversation is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.730" end="00:57:48.710" style="s2">good place to avoid that in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:51.650" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.710" end="00:57:53.810" style="s2">hiding there for me because I do I do</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.650" end="00:57:55.580" style="s2">know the political landscape well enough</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.810" end="00:57:57.260" style="s2">to be able to have those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.580" end="00:58:02.030" style="s2">and just sort of see where it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.260" end="00:58:04.369" style="s2">from but at the same time I find it</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.030" end="00:58:05.900" style="s2">quite intimidating like it&#39;s scary it</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.369" end="00:58:07.160" style="s2">honestly scares me as well because I</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.900" end="00:58:08.180" style="s2">feel like I need to do a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.160" end="00:58:10.430" style="s2">research so I&#39;m gonna have these</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.180" end="00:58:11.930" style="s2">conversations I need to be but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.430" end="00:58:14.450" style="s2">lot more exposure there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.930" end="00:58:20.270" style="s2">potential for one side or the other to</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.450" end="00:58:21.560" style="s2">start saying and for example the just a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.270" end="00:58:23.180" style="s2">small example like that the interview I</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.560" end="00:58:26.770" style="s2">did with Dave Rubin for example was the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.180" end="00:58:26.770" style="s2">first interview that I did where I felt</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.950" end="00:58:30.470" style="s2">he&#39;s obviously sort of identified with</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.420" end="00:58:31.940" style="s2">the intellectual dark where when we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.470" end="00:58:33.619" style="s2">done stuff on the inside dark web but I</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.940" end="00:58:35.690" style="s2">as I was researching that interviewers</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.619" end="00:58:38.650" style="s2">like I&#39;m also a journalist and actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.690" end="00:58:40.790" style="s2">I think a lot of what Dave Rubin does is</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.650" end="00:58:44.150" style="s2">there&#39;s some serious questions that need</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.790" end="00:58:45.680" style="s2">to be asked about whether he is fulfil</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.150" end="00:58:47.660" style="s2">it what role he&#39;s fulfilling in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:49.580" style="s2">cultural landscape how he conducts his</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.660" end="00:58:51.650" style="s2">interviews those have really valid</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.580" end="00:58:53.240" style="s2">questions and personally for my own</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.650" end="00:58:57.109" style="s2">integrity I feel I need to ask him these</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.240" end="00:58:59.540" style="s2">questions there wasn&#39;t a huge blowback</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.109" end="00:59:00.830" style="s2">from that like we we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.540" end="00:59:02.359" style="s2">profile for those who&#39;ve been a huge</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.830" end="00:59:03.680" style="s2">blowback from that interview but there</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.359" end="00:59:05.690" style="s2">was some blowback from that interview</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.680" end="00:59:06.780" style="s2">there was some people on the comments</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.690" end="00:59:11.400" style="s2">thread saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.780" end="00:59:14.070" style="s2">you ambushed him or you were whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.400" end="00:59:16.650" style="s2">kind of like you you&#39;re you&#39;re smearing</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.070" end="00:59:19.110" style="s2">him or whatever like a taste of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.650" end="00:59:21.630" style="s2">sort of there&#39;s energy there and it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.110" end="00:59:23.280" style="s2">sort of feels like it&#39;s easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.630" end="00:59:26.370" style="s2">pulled into wanting that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.280" end="00:59:29.490" style="s2">response but also there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.370" end="00:59:31.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a double-edged sword as well of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.490" end="00:59:33.480" style="s2">like being drawn into that political</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.340" end="00:59:35.250" style="s2">conversation but I can see it being very</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.480" end="00:59:39.960" style="s2">tempting to be part of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.250" end="00:59:42.780" style="s2">twitter twitter kind of fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.960" end="00:59:44.040" style="s2">yeah and part of my personality likes</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.780" end="00:59:46.770" style="s2">that kind of stuff as well so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.040" end="00:59:48.750" style="s2">really does that answer your question of</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.770" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">this or i think so but it also brings up</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.750" end="00:59:52.230" style="s2">an interesting thought about dave rubin</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:54.320" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been discussing actually i</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.230" end="00:59:58.310" style="s2">think it was a discussion with you about</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.320" end="01:00:01.140" style="s2">the need for people kind of spearheading</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.310" end="01:00:02.790" style="s2">new knowledge for all of humanity in</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.140" end="01:00:04.560" style="s2">people who are generalist trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.790" end="01:00:09.000" style="s2">connect the dots of all these experts</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.560" end="01:00:11.130" style="s2">out there and and I see you and Dave</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.000" end="01:00:12.780" style="s2">kind of occupying the same sphere except</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.130" end="01:00:15.720" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying I&#39;m a thought leader</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.780" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">of this of any specific area and Dave</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.720" end="01:00:20.070" style="s2">Rubin saying like I&#39;m I&#39;m part of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:21.870" style="s2">intellectual deep web he&#39;s like he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.070" end="01:00:24.600" style="s2">really he&#39;s just putting connections</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.870" end="01:00:26.940" style="s2">together and but you&#39;re you&#39;re making an</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.600" end="01:00:29.840" style="s2">effort not to just be seen a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.940" end="01:00:32.430" style="s2">but also to participate in it you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.840" end="01:00:33.510" style="s2">and make those connections facilitate</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.430" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">with conversations but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.510" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">claiming to be anything you&#39;re not it</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:39.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;re claiming to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:41.220" style="s2">anything yeah I&#39;d say that Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.450" end="01:00:42.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily claim like he</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.220" end="01:00:44.730" style="s2">actually did say in the interview with</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.600" end="01:00:46.170" style="s2">me that he he feels like the connective</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.730" end="01:00:48.660" style="s2">tissue for all of these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.170" end="01:00:50.250" style="s2">rather than an intellectual himself so I</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.660" end="01:00:53.310" style="s2">did want to give him give him that I</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.250" end="01:00:56.460" style="s2">think my critique of him would be more</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.310" end="01:00:59.490" style="s2">and I could I also had this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.460" end="01:01:01.020" style="s2">with Joe Shapiro recently like Dave</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.490" end="01:01:03.690" style="s2">Rubin is a cautionary tale of what can</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.020" end="01:01:07.490" style="s2">happen on the Internet because you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.690" end="01:01:10.170" style="s2">easily get into a position where you are</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.490" end="01:01:11.640" style="s2">audience capture becomes a thing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.170" end="01:01:13.140" style="s2">dynamics like this is a fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.640" end="01:01:15.060" style="s2">thing I&#39;d love to explore at length at</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.140" end="01:01:16.350" style="s2">some point and but the different</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.060" end="01:01:19.260" style="s2">dynamics between being in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.350" end="01:01:19.940" style="s2">media to being on YouTube are huge and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.260" end="01:01:22.430" style="s2">there&#39;s danger</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.940" end="01:01:26.359" style="s2">both but the big dangers in YouTube for</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.430" end="01:01:30.890" style="s2">example a few days ago I put out a film</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.359" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">where I talked to James Lindsay and I it</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.890" end="01:01:34.460" style="s2">was about impossible conversations I</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:37.549" style="s2">made the point to him that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.460" end="01:01:39.289" style="s2">really model that on Twitter and his</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.549" end="01:01:40.700" style="s2">defense was the Twitter performance and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.289" end="01:01:42.440" style="s2">I put I played both sides of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.700" end="01:01:44.270" style="s2">criticism I played a guy who was</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.440" end="01:01:46.460" style="s2">criticizing Lindsay and then played his</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.270" end="01:01:48.200" style="s2">response in full which I thought was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.460" end="01:01:50.510" style="s2">really fair way to do it I didn&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.200" end="01:01:52.190" style="s2">of I didn&#39;t if it had been a channel 4</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.510" end="01:01:56.450" style="s2">news piece for example I might have led</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.190" end="01:01:58.220" style="s2">with with a slightly more sensationalist</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.450" end="01:01:59.510" style="s2">take and cut it a little bit more but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.220" end="01:02:01.099" style="s2">played the whole thing I played the</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.510" end="01:02:03.410" style="s2">whole exchange and there were still</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.099" end="01:02:06.230" style="s2">people in the thread saying you you</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.410" end="01:02:08.539" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t treat a guest like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.230" end="01:02:10.670" style="s2">like it&#39;s fascinating like the different</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.539" end="01:02:13.010" style="s2">expectations we have of YouTube versus</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.670" end="01:02:15.260" style="s2">mainstream media and one of the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.010" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">big ones is that if you&#39;re one I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.260" end="01:02:18.680" style="s2">working for channel 4 news if you ask</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:20.809" style="s2">come on for an interview you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.680" end="01:02:24.740" style="s2">them a massive favor and you have this</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.809" end="01:02:26.660" style="s2">sort of institutional authority behind</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.740" end="01:02:28.579" style="s2">you that you can treat your guests</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.660" end="01:02:30.230" style="s2">whatever way you want and it&#39;s expected</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.579" end="01:02:31.880" style="s2">it&#39;s expected that you will ask them the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.230" end="01:02:32.270" style="s2">tough questions you don&#39;t and you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.880" end="01:02:34.579" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.270" end="01:02:38.180" style="s2">whereas on YouTube it&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.579" end="01:02:40.460" style="s2">different dynamic you you have you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.180" end="01:02:43.430" style="s2">a difficulty when you&#39;re starting out</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.460" end="01:02:44.930" style="s2">like if I just attack everyone I have in</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.430" end="01:02:46.099" style="s2">my channel quickly get to the point</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.930" end="01:02:47.900" style="s2">where no one want to go on the channel</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.099" end="01:02:49.220" style="s2">so you have this very different</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.900" end="01:02:52.250" style="s2">relationship with the guests who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.220" end="01:02:56.390" style="s2">agreed to come on and it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.250" end="01:02:58.490" style="s2">then slip into kind of justifying a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.390" end="01:03:01.309" style="s2">softball style for example which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.490" end="01:03:02.960" style="s2">seen Dave Rubin do and I also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.309" end="01:03:04.819" style="s2">think that that in itself is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.960" end="01:03:06.380" style="s2">you have to in a way to understand what</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.819" end="01:03:06.920" style="s2">Dave Rubin is up to you it&#39;s a very deep</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.380" end="01:03:08.990" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.920" end="01:03:13.099" style="s2">there&#39;s a set of films by a guy called</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.990" end="01:03:14.599" style="s2">timber on toast where and it takes in</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.099" end="01:03:16.789" style="s2">four hours to go through what the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.599" end="01:03:19.460" style="s2">problems are with a Rubin show and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.789" end="01:03:22.010" style="s2">mainly that he doesn&#39;t it only goes one</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.460" end="01:03:23.990" style="s2">way there&#39;s a narrative that Davis has</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.010" end="01:03:25.819" style="s2">about the left and all of his guests fit</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.990" end="01:03:27.109" style="s2">that narrative and he doesn&#39;t push back</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.819" end="01:03:29.390" style="s2">against part of that narrative that</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.109" end="01:03:31.640" style="s2">don&#39;t fit and so he&#39;s what he&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.390" end="01:03:35.240" style="s2">a very partial rendering of a</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.640" end="01:03:37.460" style="s2">complex cultural landscape and for</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.240" end="01:03:39.020" style="s2">another perspective collapsing what</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.460" end="01:03:41.870" style="s2">needs to be a very high-resolution</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.020" end="01:03:43.790" style="s2">critique of say the left or the culture</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.870" end="01:03:45.770" style="s2">into a very low resolution critique and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.790" end="01:03:48.830" style="s2">when he has other people on his podcast</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.770" end="01:03:50.870" style="s2">who don&#39;t fit that and actually have</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.830" end="01:03:51.800" style="s2">some fairly reprehensible views who if</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.870" end="01:03:53.270" style="s2">they were on the left he would</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.800" end="01:03:55.340" style="s2">definitely ask them about definitely</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.270" end="01:03:57.860" style="s2">criticize he doesn&#39;t criticize them so</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.340" end="01:03:59.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a really fascinating like</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.860" end="01:04:01.670" style="s2">that dynamic of the different</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.930" end="01:04:04.340" style="s2">expectations of mainstream versus</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.670" end="01:04:07.040" style="s2">YouTube media and and how that can lead</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.340" end="01:04:08.900" style="s2">to corruption of the truth on both sides</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.040" end="01:04:12.410" style="s2">because I think on the mainstream side</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.900" end="01:04:14.390" style="s2">you just get caught in sensationalism</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.410" end="01:04:16.640" style="s2">you just get caught in a sort of pseudo</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.390" end="01:04:18.230" style="s2">oppositional but you saw that with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.640" end="01:04:20.750" style="s2">Kathy Newman Jordan Peterson interviewer</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.230" end="01:04:23.870" style="s2">but that whole modality just collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.750" end="01:04:25.910" style="s2">because Jordan Pederson was because of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.870" end="01:04:27.710" style="s2">Jordan Peterson wasn&#39;t who Kathy Neiman</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.910" end="01:04:30.260" style="s2">was it&#39;s just like hang on this is this</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.710" end="01:04:31.310" style="s2">whole thing just look weird what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.260" end="01:04:33.020" style="s2">interesting about this whole meta</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.310" end="01:04:37.040" style="s2">conversation and the event that we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.020" end="01:04:38.930" style="s2">right now is is the analyzing the meta</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.040" end="01:04:40.280" style="s2">conversation and the places that people</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.930" end="01:04:42.320" style="s2">are coming from in these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.280" end="01:04:43.310" style="s2">like what is the intention what is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.320" end="01:04:44.900" style="s2">thing I&#39;m trying to do when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.310" end="01:04:46.940" style="s2">interviewing someone or having a</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.900" end="01:04:49.040" style="s2">conversation I like the way Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.940" end="01:04:50.450" style="s2">Peterson approaches it because he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.040" end="01:04:52.850" style="s2">trying to find truth he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.450" end="01:04:54.320" style="s2">uncover dig up truth and people keep</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.850" end="01:04:56.510" style="s2">approaching him from these lenses of</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.320" end="01:04:59.360" style="s2">like what&#39;s your agenda or try and drag</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.510" end="01:05:00.950" style="s2">him in the political sphere and so like</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.360" end="01:05:03.170" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole new conversation</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.950" end="01:05:07.100" style="s2">that&#39;s arising that is is addressing</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.170" end="01:05:09.170" style="s2">that meta intention behind interviewers</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.100" end="01:05:10.850" style="s2">and and people engaged in a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.170" end="01:05:12.620" style="s2">that I&#39;m really fascinated by and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.850" end="01:05:13.730" style="s2">the three of us are actually all</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.620" end="01:05:16.610" style="s2">approaching it in completely different</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.730" end="01:05:18.920" style="s2">ways too which is like you know I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.610" end="01:05:20.840" style="s2">conversation with my wife that other</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.920" end="01:05:22.310" style="s2">people sometimes join and it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.840" end="01:05:23.300" style="s2">don&#39;t give a what other people say</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.310" end="01:05:25.850" style="s2">I don&#39;t give a what the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.300" end="01:05:27.560" style="s2">conversation is I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.850" end="01:05:30.260" style="s2">popular or not I just want to go there</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.560" end="01:05:32.330" style="s2">and and I suffer for that in other ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.260" end="01:05:34.640" style="s2">and you said you&#39;re having like a dance</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.330" end="01:05:36.350" style="s2">with the the person the person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.640" end="01:05:39.380" style="s2">interviewing and it&#39;s really one-on-one</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.350" end="01:05:40.910" style="s2">so there is more of like that dance you</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.380" end="01:05:42.680" style="s2">know and you&#39;ve got like this</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.910" end="01:05:43.670" style="s2">journalistic perspective and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.680" end="01:05:45.380" style="s2">trying to you</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.670" end="01:05:47.089" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing it through that lens and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.380" end="01:05:50.210" style="s2">trying to ask hard-hitting questions and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.089" end="01:05:53.150" style="s2">do your job as a journalist so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.210" end="01:05:55.250" style="s2">really find the the flavor that it takes</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.150" end="01:05:57.109" style="s2">the conversation in to be really</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.250" end="01:05:58.819" style="s2">different which is why we can all occupy</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.109" end="01:06:00.829" style="s2">the same sense making whatever you want</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.819" end="01:06:02.780" style="s2">to call it intellectual deep web space</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.829" end="01:06:05.450" style="s2">but have such different flavors and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.780" end="01:06:07.030" style="s2">exact same conversations you know one</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.450" end="01:06:09.740" style="s2">thing that came up for me too is like</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.030" end="01:06:11.990" style="s2">there is a way I think in which the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.740" end="01:06:14.630" style="s2">solution is the same for all of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.990" end="01:06:17.660" style="s2">different mimetic tribes right yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.630" end="01:06:20.119" style="s2">is this like humiliation and recognition</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.660" end="01:06:22.670" style="s2">that my vision and understanding of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.119" end="01:06:24.890" style="s2">world isn&#39;t what is actually going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.670" end="01:06:27.230" style="s2">get us there right and like so there is</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.890" end="01:06:29.720" style="s2">that kind of unit a unitary solution and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.230" end="01:06:31.760" style="s2">there&#39;s this like hyper sophistication</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.720" end="01:06:33.799" style="s2">needed to interface with the current</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.760" end="01:06:35.569" style="s2">like reality of how narratives get</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.799" end="01:06:38.059" style="s2">constructed constructed and how the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.569" end="01:06:40.849" style="s2">culture gets constantly reconstituted</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.059" end="01:06:42.470" style="s2">and and constructed right and like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.849" end="01:06:44.299" style="s2">you can see that and that you can do</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.470" end="01:06:45.859" style="s2">that like I can&#39;t do that I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.299" end="01:06:48.380" style="s2">all those things that you see because of</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.859" end="01:06:51.349" style="s2">your training enables you to see that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.380" end="01:06:54.200" style="s2">and but you also have the vision of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.349" end="01:06:57.650" style="s2">kind of like post identity possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.200" end="01:07:00.440" style="s2">future that I think will uniquely afford</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.650" end="01:07:03.530" style="s2">you to interface with different tribal</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.440" end="01:07:05.930" style="s2">systems in a way that doesn&#39;t then isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.530" end="01:07:07.880" style="s2">simply trying to convert them to your</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.930" end="01:07:11.720" style="s2">tribal system but it&#39;s trying to invite</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.880" end="01:07:14.089" style="s2">them somewhere else that we can then</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.720" end="01:07:15.770" style="s2">kind of be having those countries I mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.089" end="01:07:18.109" style="s2">you have those conversations too but</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.770" end="01:07:20.630" style="s2">there&#39;s less like gotcha or like trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.109" end="01:07:23.390" style="s2">to catch people in our world because</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.630" end="01:07:26.270" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of like playing the same game</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.390" end="01:07:27.950" style="s2">in a way that I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.270" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">that we do that but also we need to call</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.950" end="01:07:33.049" style="s2">out people who like are playing other</p>

<p begin="01:07:33.049" end="01:07:41.089" style="s2">yeah yeah and there&#39;s a even just the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.000" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">terminology like gotcha and for example</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.089" end="01:07:48.369" style="s2">the the interview with Dave Rubin which</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:51.530" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m actually very I don&#39;t enjoy</p>

<p begin="01:07:51.530" end="01:07:55.640" style="s2">asking the difficult questions but</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.049" end="01:07:57.180" style="s2">there&#39;s been occasion where I&#39;ve felt</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.640" end="01:07:58.920" style="s2">that I&#39;ve had to do that because</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.180" end="01:08:00.359" style="s2">I&#39;m like I can&#39;t have an interview with</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.920" end="01:08:02.160" style="s2">this person without doing that like the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.359" end="01:08:05.010" style="s2">John Cleese interview being a classic</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.160" end="01:08:06.869" style="s2">example where a few days before he had</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.010" end="01:08:09.900" style="s2">this huge media storm over comments he</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.869" end="01:08:11.730" style="s2">made about London I was like oh no this</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.900" end="01:08:13.770" style="s2">interview had been in the works for like</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.730" end="01:08:15.380" style="s2">six months and it&#39;s night on now now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.770" end="01:08:18.270" style="s2">gonna have to ask John Cleese whether</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.380" end="01:08:19.290" style="s2">what he meant by those tweets and a lot</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.270" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">of people in the press calling him a</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.290" end="01:08:21.929" style="s2">racist and some of that I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:24.420" style="s2">want to ask John Cleese whether he</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.420" end="01:08:28.469" style="s2">want to this is one of my kind of comedy</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.609" end="01:08:30.719" style="s2">heroes who is doing us a massive favor</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.469" end="01:08:31.980" style="s2">by by agreeing to the interview and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.719" end="01:08:36.870" style="s2">like I don&#39;t want to have to do that but</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.980" end="01:08:39.449" style="s2">I also feel that I can&#39;t not ask the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.870" end="01:08:41.699" style="s2">question and and that maybe might sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.449" end="01:08:44.009" style="s2">of just just a sign of a relic of my</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.699" end="01:08:47.279" style="s2">journalistic background but I also feel</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.009" end="01:08:48.569" style="s2">I feel the weight of could know what</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.279" end="01:08:49.949" style="s2">John Cleese didn&#39;t give any interviews</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.569" end="01:08:51.509" style="s2">about this and pretty much everyone in</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.949" end="01:08:53.239" style="s2">the media would have wanted into John</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.509" end="01:08:56.699" style="s2">Cleese oh it&#39;s a big it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.239" end="01:08:59.609" style="s2">journalistic event or get to have him on</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.699" end="01:09:02.190" style="s2">the channel at all and I also know that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.609" end="01:09:03.870" style="s2">all of my former colleagues would if</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.190" end="01:09:07.380" style="s2">they notice that that&#39;s going on at all</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.870" end="01:09:08.520" style="s2">would be like I can&#39;t you call yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.380" end="01:09:09.690" style="s2">a journalist you had an interview with</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.520" end="01:09:11.670" style="s2">John Cleese and you didn&#39;t ask him about</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.690" end="01:09:13.949" style="s2">the biggest news event he&#39;s had over the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.670" end="01:09:16.290" style="s2">last three years so there is that kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.949" end="01:09:18.449" style="s2">of going on as well and I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.290" end="01:09:20.759" style="s2">second-guess myself whether I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.449" end="01:09:24.660" style="s2">doing it because of that rather than</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.759" end="01:09:26.279" style="s2">like what is what what is required but I</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.660" end="01:09:28.049" style="s2">felt like I know I have to ask him this</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.279" end="01:09:32.540" style="s2">and actually he was fine he was fine to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.049" end="01:09:36.060" style="s2">reply to that question and I think I</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.540" end="01:09:38.580" style="s2">think the integrity for me that what the</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.060" end="01:09:41.640" style="s2">space that I think we&#39;ve carved out with</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.580" end="01:09:45.330" style="s2">rebel wisdom is in the in the free</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.640" end="01:09:47.580" style="s2">speech free speech space so I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.330" end="01:09:49.710" style="s2">there is an injunction to ask those kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.580" end="01:09:51.509" style="s2">of questions but yeah you can hear the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.710" end="01:09:53.549" style="s2">kind of the triple and quadruple</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.509" end="01:09:54.900" style="s2">guessing that goes on yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.549" end="01:09:56.429" style="s2">like what you said that there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.900" end="01:09:58.920" style="s2">you&#39;re almost attracted to this space</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.429" end="01:10:00.420" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of heat right like</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.920" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">that&#39;s actually kind of calling you and</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.420" end="01:10:03.989" style="s2">what came to me was that within the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:06.060" style="s2">alchemical tradition right heat is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.989" end="01:10:08.250" style="s2">necessary part of the transmutation</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.060" end="01:10:10.150" style="s2">process right if you can actually learn</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.250" end="01:10:12.880" style="s2">to enter into that</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.150" end="01:10:16.270" style="s2">that heat and use it to kind of create a</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.880" end="01:10:18.790" style="s2">transformative process like that&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.270" end="01:10:19.960" style="s2">that&#39;s really significant and so I kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.790" end="01:10:21.190" style="s2">of actually had the flip where I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.960" end="01:10:22.960" style="s2">like oh this you&#39;re right this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.190" end="01:10:25.390" style="s2">gotcha this is actually like something</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.960" end="01:10:27.850" style="s2">else is perhaps happening here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.390" end="01:10:29.500" style="s2">really interesting yeah yeah the gotcha</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.850" end="01:10:31.570" style="s2">term was was because there were some</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.500" end="01:10:36.280" style="s2">people who referred to the Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.570" end="01:10:38.710" style="s2">interview as a gotcha interview I firmly</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.280" end="01:10:40.570" style="s2">disagree with with that I mean I I</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.710" end="01:10:41.890" style="s2">didn&#39;t like I said I don&#39;t enjoy those</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.570" end="01:10:43.480" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t actually watch the Dave</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.890" end="01:10:45.790" style="s2">Rubin interview back for quite a while</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.480" end="01:10:46.900" style="s2">afterwards cuz I felt and then when I</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.790" end="01:10:50.110" style="s2">watched it back I was like actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.900" end="01:10:52.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good I was really happy</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.110" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">with how it went and I still think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.840" end="01:10:56.110" style="s2">one of the better interviews that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:58.060" style="s2">done because I made very clear with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.110" end="01:10:59.380" style="s2">questions that came earlier on why I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.060" end="01:11:02.760" style="s2">leading up to what I was leading up to</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.380" end="01:11:05.380" style="s2">like what is the IDW is it about</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.760" end="01:11:07.239" style="s2">difficult conversations is it about and</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.380" end="01:11:09.159" style="s2">framing it within a context where I</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.239" end="01:11:11.110" style="s2">thought it led on very naturally to</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.159" end="01:11:16.690" style="s2">saying well how about this and how about</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.110" end="01:11:18.850" style="s2">this but it&#39;s I find it yeah I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.690" end="01:11:23.050" style="s2">don&#39;t enjoy that I don&#39;t find it but but</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.850" end="01:11:26.320" style="s2">I feel you must yes yeah yeah related to</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.050" end="01:11:28.090" style="s2">this whole subject of of how to have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.320" end="01:11:31.060" style="s2">conversation how to debate I I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.090" end="01:11:32.679" style="s2">there&#39;s this meta thing happening with</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.060" end="01:11:34.239" style="s2">this whole intellectual deep web</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.679" end="01:11:37.780" style="s2">movement or whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.239" end="01:11:41.170" style="s2">that is like weird or at least some of</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.780" end="01:11:42.909" style="s2">us out there are trying to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.170" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">conversations and demonstrate how to</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.909" end="01:11:47.850" style="s2">increase sense-making and come to truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:51.040" style="s2">together through debate sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.850" end="01:11:52.960" style="s2">through those difficult hot moments with</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.040" end="01:11:54.640" style="s2">other people and I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.960" end="01:11:57.280" style="s2">contributing and whether people are</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.640" end="01:11:58.900" style="s2">conscious of it or not to the popularity</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.280" end="01:12:00.580" style="s2">of this the explosion of this whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.900" end="01:12:02.679" style="s2">movement because we&#39;ve lost the ability</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.580" end="01:12:06.429" style="s2">to actually have sense making debates</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.679" end="01:12:09.699" style="s2">and conversations as a society and to</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.429" end="01:12:12.900" style="s2">watch these different dynamics you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.699" end="01:12:16.929" style="s2">arguments and debates actually come to</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.900" end="01:12:18.250" style="s2">an end point where we all have learned</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.929" end="01:12:21.250" style="s2">something instead of just a</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.250" end="01:12:23.400" style="s2">dick-measuring contest it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.250" end="01:12:24.780" style="s2">really to me it&#39;s a new phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.400" end="01:12:26.640" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating and I think other</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.780" end="01:12:29.219" style="s2">people are tuning in for that reason and</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.640" end="01:12:30.570" style="s2">we&#39;re it&#39;s also like they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.219" end="01:12:36.030" style="s2">learning from it and applying it in</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.570" end="01:12:38.820" style="s2">their own lives too yeah yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.030" end="01:12:42.989" style="s2">probably hitting the one and a half hour</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.820" end="01:12:44.250" style="s2">mark and the conversation I think we</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.989" end="01:12:47.810" style="s2">should definitely do it again of really</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.250" end="01:12:51.150" style="s2">yeah a lot of really fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.810" end="01:12:53.880" style="s2">emergent perspectives here is there</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.150" end="01:12:57.870" style="s2">anything that we feel that we want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.880" end="01:13:01.620" style="s2">and take the opportunity of the last</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.870" end="01:13:03.510" style="s2">sort of five or ten minutes to know this</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.620" end="01:13:04.800" style="s2">is that this is really pleasurable for</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.510" end="01:13:07.650" style="s2">me I think part of what made it so</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.800" end="01:13:10.140" style="s2">enjoyable was that we like spent time</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.650" end="01:13:12.500" style="s2">together leading up to this and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.140" end="01:13:17.280" style="s2">a feeling of like safety and</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.500" end="01:13:19.980" style="s2">togetherness that yeah I think allowed</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.280" end="01:13:23.360" style="s2">this conversation to to emerge the way</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.980" end="01:13:26.190" style="s2">it did and so on yeah it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.360" end="01:13:28.650" style="s2">yeah I agree yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.190" end="01:13:31.860" style="s2">I&#39;m also look I&#39;m always looking for</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.650" end="01:13:33.750" style="s2">that that kind of what value can be</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.860" end="01:13:35.550" style="s2">extracted which is actually part of my</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.750" end="01:13:36.900" style="s2">lens as well it&#39;s like what is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.550" end="01:13:38.610" style="s2">actionable thing at the end of this</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.900" end="01:13:40.530" style="s2">because is the rational person trying to</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.610" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">deconstruct rationality it&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.530" end="01:13:44.400" style="s2">my homework what&#39;s the thing I take from</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:45.960" style="s2">this so I&#39;m interested to know your</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:48.989" style="s2">guys&#39;s perspectives on this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.960" end="01:13:50.370" style="s2">from that standpoint what is at least</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.989" end="01:13:52.230" style="s2">what is emerging or where do you think</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.370" end="01:13:54.030" style="s2">this is going this conversation is going</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.230" end="01:13:57.719" style="s2">and what is actionable for people are</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.030" end="01:14:00.030" style="s2">useful out of what we talked about or</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.719" end="01:14:04.560" style="s2">just personally what has been useful for</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.030" end="01:14:09.480" style="s2">you yeah in terms of where the</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.560" end="01:14:15.090" style="s2">conversation is going I think very much</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.480" end="01:14:23.690" style="s2">does felt certainly we felt this sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.090" end="01:14:27.090" style="s2">of reaching some kind of synthesis of</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.690" end="01:14:30.230" style="s2">the intellectually embodied and the need</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.090" end="01:14:33.060" style="s2">for in-person</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.230" end="01:14:36.239" style="s2">meetups and events to take this work</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.060" end="01:14:38.340" style="s2">forward so we&#39;re putting on what we call</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.239" end="01:14:39.570" style="s2">in the collective intelligence lab we</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.340" end="01:14:43.580" style="s2">were just practicing with some of these</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.570" end="01:14:46.469" style="s2">technologies some of these practices and</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.580" end="01:14:47.489" style="s2">coming together to see if we can create</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.469" end="01:14:51.060" style="s2">something that&#39;s more than the sum of</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.489" end="01:14:52.770" style="s2">its parts and orient it towards the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.060" end="01:14:53.790" style="s2">cultural moment whatever the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.770" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">moment is whether they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.790" end="01:14:57.239" style="s2">difficult conversations or whether</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:14:59.010" style="s2">that&#39;s thinking about existential risk</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.239" end="01:15:02.160" style="s2">or whether that what whatever the topics</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.010" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">are certainly the the collective</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.160" end="01:15:06.750" style="s2">intelligence collective sense making is</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:10.320" style="s2">another good word collective wisdom is</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.750" end="01:15:13.860" style="s2">something I really like as well what</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.320" end="01:15:15.870" style="s2">does that look like and this also this</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.860" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">sense of different people from all of</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.870" end="01:15:20.570" style="s2">these different places for example I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:22.730" style="s2">struck by John bhave key for example I</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.570" end="01:15:25.199" style="s2">think he&#39;s got he&#39;s got such an amazing</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.730" end="01:15:28.739" style="s2">perspective and also what&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:30.449" style="s2">wonderful to see is he since he put out</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.739" end="01:15:33.800" style="s2">solar putting out his series awakening</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.449" end="01:15:37.199" style="s2">from the meaning crisis he has become</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.800" end="01:15:38.880" style="s2">swept up in this evolving conversation</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.199" end="01:15:39.989" style="s2">and he&#39;s met so many interesting people</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.880" end="01:15:43.440" style="s2">Ian&#39;s for having all of these</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.989" end="01:15:47.010" style="s2">fascinating conversations and this sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.440" end="01:15:50.460" style="s2">of a community self-organizing around</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.010" end="01:15:53.160" style="s2">these bigger questions is really</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.460" end="01:15:55.199" style="s2">interesting and really fruitful so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.160" end="01:15:56.699" style="s2">also interested in who are the people</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.199" end="01:15:59.280" style="s2">that should be in dialogue with each</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.699" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">other to move these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.280" end="01:16:06.739" style="s2">forward the the this sort of ambassadors</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:11.160" style="s2">from the different mimetic tribes for a</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.739" end="01:16:12.960" style="s2">is one way of looking at it that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.160" end="01:16:14.719" style="s2">interesting place it&#39;s like what at what</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.960" end="01:16:16.410" style="s2">are the what are the people and</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.719" end="01:16:19.530" style="s2">conversations that need to be had to</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.410" end="01:16:21.210" style="s2">move things forward and then what is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.530" end="01:16:24.330" style="s2">relationship between in person</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.210" end="01:16:25.949" style="s2">collective intelligence practice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.330" end="01:16:29.850" style="s2">that&#39;s where I feel the conversation has</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.949" end="01:16:31.110" style="s2">reached now in the last two years I</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.850" end="01:16:35.060" style="s2">think that I think we had a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.110" end="01:16:38.699" style="s2">trajectory of the Trump brexit moment of</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.060" end="01:16:40.350" style="s2">well okay something for me it was like</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.699" end="01:16:42.420" style="s2">okay this is the time oh this is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.350" end="01:16:43.770" style="s2">time when this is gonna when all of</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.420" end="01:16:45.750" style="s2">these things are going to be needed when</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.770" end="01:16:49.860" style="s2">like for me it&#39;s the death it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.750" end="01:16:52.980" style="s2">death rattle of the the old way like</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.860" end="01:16:55.770" style="s2">Trump is if we talk about game a and</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.980" end="01:16:57.810" style="s2">game B Trump is game a and Connacht it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.770" end="01:16:59.370" style="s2">like he operates in a zero he is game</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.810" end="01:17:00.630" style="s2">theory incarnate he ought to operate in</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.370" end="01:17:06.810" style="s2">a zero trust world</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.630" end="01:17:09.750" style="s2">he creates chaos he he is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.810" end="01:17:11.850" style="s2">basically game theory prisoner&#39;s dilemma</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.750" end="01:17:14.670" style="s2">where if you trust someone you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.850" end="01:17:15.750" style="s2">moron because someone will will you</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.670" end="01:17:18.900" style="s2">over down the line</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.750" end="01:17:21.929" style="s2">Trump is that Trump is that and he so</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.900" end="01:17:26.400" style="s2">him like that for me is like he is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.929" end="01:17:28.170" style="s2">apotheosis of game a so game be this</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.400" end="01:17:30.030" style="s2">this has to be the time like over the</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.170" end="01:17:32.550" style="s2">next however many years has to be the</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.030" end="01:17:37.260" style="s2">time to this game B Network to solidify</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.550" end="01:17:40.739" style="s2">and hopefully show itself to be superior</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.260" end="01:17:43.770" style="s2">at out competing game a so it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.739" end="01:17:44.790" style="s2">growing in the cracks of game a then</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.770" end="01:17:46.620" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these other questions</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.790" end="01:17:49.290" style="s2">about how do you then kind of guard</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.620" end="01:17:51.570" style="s2">against people who are using co-opting</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.290" end="01:17:54.510" style="s2">it or using game B terminology without</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.570" end="01:17:57.060" style="s2">actually being game B all of that sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.510" end="01:17:59.580" style="s2">of stuff and knowing that unless we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.060" end="01:18:03.090" style="s2">dealt with our own stuff and desire to</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.580" end="01:18:06.000" style="s2">as Jamie wheel says like snatch the ring</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.090" end="01:18:07.380" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got to be being aware of</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.000" end="01:18:09.150" style="s2">like that&#39;s where the conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.380" end="01:18:11.160" style="s2">going as well and kind of thinking as</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.150" end="01:18:13.350" style="s2">I&#39;m talking now that&#39;s a big part of</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.160" end="01:18:15.480" style="s2">where the conversation needs to go next</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.350" end="01:18:17.010" style="s2">especially in these game be networked</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.480" end="01:18:19.199" style="s2">place it&#39;s like okay how do we guard</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.010" end="01:18:21.330" style="s2">against what&#39;s an immune response for</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:23.429" style="s2">people who are talking the talk we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.330" end="01:18:28.739" style="s2">not walking the walk who are using it</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.429" end="01:18:31.710" style="s2">for their own narcissistic ends what how</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.739" end="01:18:35.370" style="s2">do we guard against this nascent network</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.710" end="01:18:37.620" style="s2">being co-opted infiltrated all of these</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.370" end="01:18:42.150" style="s2">questions are really alive for me at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.620" end="01:18:43.770" style="s2">moment there&#39;s something else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.150" end="01:18:47.219" style="s2">been happening recently have really been</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.770" end="01:18:49.590" style="s2">paying attention to which is I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.219" end="01:18:51.890" style="s2">think of it before but people really do</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.590" end="01:18:54.950" style="s2">try to give up their sovereigns</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.890" end="01:18:56.690" style="s2">sometimes they really try to have</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.950" end="01:18:58.790" style="s2">someone else make sense of the world for</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.690" end="01:19:03.560" style="s2">them and take action in the world and it</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.790" end="01:19:06.710" style="s2">it&#39;s is really surprised me how in even</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.560" end="01:19:08.180" style="s2">these communities and and in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.710" end="01:19:09.500" style="s2">of these conversations we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.180" end="01:19:11.240" style="s2">looking for that we&#39;re talk we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.500" end="01:19:12.770" style="s2">literally talking about sense making and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.240" end="01:19:16.100" style="s2">demonstrating collective sense making</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.770" end="01:19:18.380" style="s2">and yet people may still want to vote</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.100" end="01:19:21.470" style="s2">you in into some position of power or me</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.380" end="01:19:22.940" style="s2">or you you know instead of recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.470" end="01:19:24.800" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.940" end="01:19:26.600" style="s2">which is we&#39;re trying to show others how</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.800" end="01:19:29.420" style="s2">to do it as well what is collective</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.600" end="01:19:32.600" style="s2">sense making let&#39;s all engage in it and</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.420" end="01:19:35.180" style="s2">it&#39;s just I just had this vision in my</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.600" end="01:19:37.400" style="s2">head before that dictators were</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.180" end="01:19:39.740" style="s2">constantly the types that were co-opting</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.400" end="01:19:41.270" style="s2">and taking power from themselves without</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.740" end="01:19:43.370" style="s2">realizing how much people are just</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.270" end="01:19:45.830" style="s2">handing them the power and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.370" end="01:19:47.270" style="s2">something I think is is not being</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.830" end="01:19:50.530" style="s2">addressed enough in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.270" end="01:19:53.660" style="s2">that I would like to see more of yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.530" end="01:19:58.190" style="s2">yeah for my part I also see a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.660" end="01:20:00.710" style="s2">transition point in the conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.190" end="01:20:01.910" style="s2">I think it cores it a lot let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.710" end="01:20:03.440" style="s2">with what you&#39;re seeing like the shift</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.910" end="01:20:06.530" style="s2">to kind of more participation and</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.440" end="01:20:08.680" style="s2">collective intelligence and it does feel</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.530" end="01:20:13.310" style="s2">like the network has become self-aware</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.680" end="01:20:17.540" style="s2">and I I said I feel like I no longer</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.310" end="01:20:20.810" style="s2">know what my role is in this thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.540" end="01:20:22.100" style="s2">actually yeah I think we&#39;re it does</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.810" end="01:20:24.260" style="s2">though feel like we&#39;re in a new phase</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.100" end="01:20:27.440" style="s2">and this this event has kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.260" end="01:20:32.060" style="s2">crystallized that for me personally and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.440" end="01:20:35.450" style="s2">so I feel much more clear about that for</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.060" end="01:20:36.980" style="s2">my own process yeah it feels like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.450" end="01:20:39.350" style="s2">been hinting at the future of some</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.980" end="01:20:41.060" style="s2">future thing and then and then this kind</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.350" end="01:20:43.910" style="s2">of awakening and self-awareness of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.060" end="01:20:46.700" style="s2">movement has made me realize it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.910" end="01:20:49.390" style="s2">like we&#39;re we&#39;re waking up to it we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.700" end="01:20:52.340" style="s2">actually have these conversations on</p>
