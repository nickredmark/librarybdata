<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.400" style="s2">so who has a hand up at the back here</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:07.470" style="s2">and one here great so that&#39;s we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.400" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">hear a couple let&#39;s take three questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.470" end="00:00:13.080" style="s2">as a whole and then we&#39;re kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:14.370" style="s2">to you to field and maybe you just say</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.080" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">who you are when you ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.370" end="00:00:20.699" style="s2">also thank you I&#39;m Steve Cunningham I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">a visitor to Scotland and Finn horn from</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.699" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">Alaska yeah I would just like to get the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:33.030" style="s2">panel&#39;s thoughts on two different things</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:36.210" style="s2">the Baha&#39;i faith and Jordan Peterson if</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.030" end="00:00:38.309" style="s2">they have any number Baha&#39;i faith the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.210" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">bahá&#39;í faith and Jordan and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.309" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">Peterson you want to explain who Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">Peterson is the people who died Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">Peterson is a former University of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">Toronto professor clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:55.050" style="s2">it&#39;s working with a lot of young people</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">these days and he&#39;s recently written a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.050" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">book called twelve rules for life to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">give young people meaning in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:05.489" style="s2">seemingly hopeless situation they find</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:09.080" style="s2">themselves in and the Baha&#39;i faith</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.489" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">claims to be a universal religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.080" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">uniting all the former religions ok</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:16.700" style="s2">great let&#39;s hold that question we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:16.700" style="s2">take one of the back here</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.549" end="00:01:24.710" style="s2">you could introduce yourself and say</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.899" end="00:01:27.740" style="s2">yeah my name&#39;s John Lautner my my</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.710" end="00:01:31.030" style="s2">question really is a number but a number</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.740" end="00:01:35.450" style="s2">of the speakers emphasized the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.030" end="00:01:38.360" style="s2">significance of paradox in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.450" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">understanding and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.360" end="00:01:44.409" style="s2">we&#39;re living in an age in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:49.250" style="s2">where paradoxes are increasingly being</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.409" end="00:01:50.959" style="s2">vilified and trying to escape from from</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.250" end="00:01:52.580" style="s2">paradox and I wondered what the view of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.959" end="00:01:56.149" style="s2">the panel was well they could elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.580" end="00:02:00.110" style="s2">more on the importance of paradox as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.149" end="00:02:03.679" style="s2">way of emerging from this very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.110" end="00:02:06.530" style="s2">narrow restricted way of living that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.679" end="00:02:08.539" style="s2">are in at the moment great thank you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.530" end="00:02:10.429" style="s2">let&#39;s maybe start with those two so a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.539" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">question about the nature of paradox and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.429" end="00:02:14.150" style="s2">also about Jordan Peterson and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:24.019" style="s2">Baha&#39;i faith who would like to kick off</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.150" end="00:02:26.989" style="s2">I can&#39;t say much about Jordan Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.019" end="00:02:30.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know about him I have met a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.989" end="00:02:32.660" style="s2">boys and they all were wonderful people</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.410" end="00:02:37.459" style="s2">but that&#39;s really all I can say about</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.660" end="00:02:41.000" style="s2">that but about the paradox if we take it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.459" end="00:02:47.299" style="s2">to what we learned about this great</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.000" end="00:02:49.579" style="s2">thought that is one big hole that needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.299" end="00:02:51.650" style="s2">to we need the separation in order to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.579" end="00:02:55.310" style="s2">have a perspective on it but we at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.650" end="00:02:59.989" style="s2">same time that hole we waves in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.310" end="00:03:05.299" style="s2">ocean that invites us into understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.989" end="00:03:08.980" style="s2">that this belief that if I hold one view</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.299" end="00:03:12.410" style="s2">and somebody else holds the seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.980" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">exclusive other view then one of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.410" end="00:03:18.290" style="s2">needs to be wrong but that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:20.209" style="s2">if what we really need is lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.290" end="00:03:23.239" style="s2">different angles on reality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.209" end="00:03:26.449" style="s2">sometimes they seem to be mutually</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.239" end="00:03:29.870" style="s2">exclusive but actually when when we work</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.449" end="00:03:30.930" style="s2">with that polarity then we enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.870" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.930" end="00:03:39.329" style="s2">of our participation and co-creation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:41.010" style="s2">this whole so I think putting paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.329" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">away or saying oh that well that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.010" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">make any sense because it&#39;s mutually</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:48.329" style="s2">exclusive and is a way of keeping us in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:51.150" style="s2">the story of separation and stopping us</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.329" end="00:03:54.659" style="s2">from experiencing interbeing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.150" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">co-creation thanks Daniel I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.659" end="00:03:59.400" style="s2">add to that if I may I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">know Jordans work either and a limited</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.400" end="00:04:04.109" style="s2">perspective the bajas I guess where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:07.889" style="s2">having a sense of is that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.109" end="00:04:10.650" style="s2">universe exists and evolves as a central</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.889" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">universe so love this unity expressed in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.650" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">diversity so our whole experience of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:20.519" style="s2">differentiation and diversity is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:22.169" style="s2">innately embedded in the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.519" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">impulse of the universe which also</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.169" end="00:04:28.110" style="s2">speaks to your point on on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">appearance of paradox but also it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.110" end="00:04:35.490" style="s2">suggests again I think what William was</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:38.070" style="s2">saying is that as we as we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.490" end="00:04:41.220" style="s2">feel free as we&#39;re able to feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.070" end="00:04:43.349" style="s2">authentic as we&#39;re able to to literally</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.220" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">step into our conscious co-create</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.349" end="00:04:45.930" style="s2">ivities</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:49.229" style="s2">there are many roads at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.930" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">mountain you know in terms of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.229" end="00:04:54.270" style="s2">practice in terms of religious cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">perspectives there are many roads at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.270" end="00:04:58.380" style="s2">same mountain and I think to say there</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">is one religion however apparently</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.380" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">generic it is suggests that there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">still that path it may be very broad my</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">sense is that our emergence our</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">conscious evolutionary potential enables</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:19.340" style="s2">us to welcome and celebrate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:22.380" style="s2">diversity and also find ways perhaps of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.340" end="00:05:25.949" style="s2">reconciling apparent paradox I talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.380" end="00:05:29.460" style="s2">about you know duality to polarity to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.949" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">relativity so that we are aware of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.460" end="00:05:33.659" style="s2">in relationship with all life in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:36.599" style="s2">sense that if period can appear very</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.659" end="00:05:39.779" style="s2">different but ultimately it is part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.599" end="00:05:42.120" style="s2">that ultimate wholeness but expressed in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.779" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">amazing abundant diverse</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.120" end="00:05:55.080" style="s2">and differentiation when I teach my</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:05:58.320" style="s2">grade 12 economics block I often think</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.080" end="00:06:01.410" style="s2">of subtitling it welcome to paradox I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.320" end="00:06:05.250" style="s2">think it&#39;s a great question and I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.410" end="00:06:08.790" style="s2">think of any in any given moment how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.250" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">experiencing it I&#39;m very much aware of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.790" end="00:06:16.320" style="s2">the IPCC findings released this week and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.370" end="00:06:18.389" style="s2">I flew to Scotland in the same week so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.320" end="00:06:24.120" style="s2">if that&#39;s not a paradox I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.389" end="00:06:26.010" style="s2">what is and I look at actually this rug</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.120" end="00:06:29.310" style="s2">here is a great example we could each</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.010" end="00:06:31.440" style="s2">take points on this rug and be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.310" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">across from each other in seeming</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.440" end="00:06:38.490" style="s2">polarity and yet we do have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">possibility of reconstructing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">picture out of that and I it always</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:44.699" style="s2">seems to me that that&#39;s just about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:48.950" style="s2">definition of what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.699" end="00:06:55.470" style="s2">how do we hold that Center and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.950" end="00:06:59.970" style="s2">redefine the whole I&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.470" end="00:07:05.160" style="s2">something obvious just being incarnate</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.970" end="00:07:08.010" style="s2">is a paradox isn&#39;t it creech creatures</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.160" end="00:07:13.010" style="s2">with cosmic consciousness strung out</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.010" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">between biological instincts and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.010" end="00:07:20.120" style="s2">developmental soul inspired expansion</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:20.120" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.370" end="00:07:25.729" style="s2">that paradox that it requires some</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.590" end="00:07:27.900" style="s2">maturity to be at ease with it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.729" end="00:07:29.790" style="s2">sometimes I see that maturity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.900" end="00:07:36.270" style="s2">children who are just at ease with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.790" end="00:07:37.949" style="s2">and yeah yeah thank you let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.270" end="00:07:43.139" style="s2">there&#39;s other questions that want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.949" end="00:07:44.760" style="s2">emerge at the back here maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.139" end="00:07:46.380" style="s2">two at the back oh there&#39;s one over here</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.760" end="00:07:47.699" style="s2">so I can&#39;t see you a little bit in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.380" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">dark but there&#39;s somebody here and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.699" end="00:07:53.510" style="s2">somebody a woman here in the row before</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:56.010" style="s2">the back is what here was a microphone</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.510" end="00:07:58.860" style="s2">this one there with a microphone also a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.010" end="00:08:02.070" style="s2">Roger in there from the crowd but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.860" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">hear from you first I&#39;d like to thank</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.070" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">everyone for your talks and I strongly</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:10.169" style="s2">resonate with a lot of what was said I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:13.800" style="s2">just wanted to say that after the IPCC</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.169" end="00:08:15.870" style="s2">report a after already having lost a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.800" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">of help I read that the Australian</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.870" end="00:08:20.669" style="s2">Government had refused to stop coal</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:22.860" style="s2">mining and so I just wonder how all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.669" end="00:08:25.320" style="s2">the approaches that you&#39;ve mentioned can</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.860" end="00:08:29.270" style="s2">filter into politics because I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.320" end="00:08:32.550" style="s2">the moment whilst changes are happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.270" end="00:08:35.190" style="s2">in the political spectrum it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.550" end="00:08:38.039" style="s2">seem to be the case so much and it still</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.190" end="00:08:39.870" style="s2">dominates a lot of of how the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.039" end="00:08:41.520" style="s2">works so I would like to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.870" end="00:08:43.229" style="s2">thoughts on that thank you so one</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.520" end="00:08:44.730" style="s2">question about politics Roger you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.229" end="00:08:45.060" style="s2">to add we&#39;re just taking a couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.730" end="00:08:47.430" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.060" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">yeah in a way it&#39;s the same same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.430" end="00:08:59.339" style="s2">theme after the announcement of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:09:01.320" style="s2">latest UN climate change panel the BBC</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.339" end="00:09:05.250" style="s2">ran an interesting program called the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.320" end="00:09:10.830" style="s2">moral maze and the key question that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.250" end="00:09:16.950" style="s2">they were looking at was is it moral is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.830" end="00:09:21.330" style="s2">it more moral to curtail the welfare of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.950" end="00:09:24.870" style="s2">people who are already alive and are</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.330" end="00:09:29.550" style="s2">already struggling predominantly in</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.190" end="00:09:37.140" style="s2">it more moral to look</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.110" end="00:09:40.230" style="s2">after their knees than it is to consider</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.140" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2">the welfare of people who are not even</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.230" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">yet born 2050 on down the road in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:51.030" style="s2">planet which may be increasing it will</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">be probably increasingly uninhabitable</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.030" end="00:09:55.620" style="s2">and you know i-i-i I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:09:58.770" style="s2">answer that question I want you or you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.620" end="00:10:00.420" style="s2">do okay so a question about how we might</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.770" end="00:10:02.070" style="s2">take some of this awareness here into</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.420" end="00:10:04.170" style="s2">the political arena and a question about</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.070" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">the morality of caring for future</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.170" end="00:10:08.790" style="s2">generations in a way that you frame it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:10.590" style="s2">at the expense of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.790" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">currently alive particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.590" end="00:10:18.570" style="s2">global south so who would like to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:23.130" style="s2">respond to that a couple of thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.570" end="00:10:26.670" style="s2">that as a healer I was invited after the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.130" end="00:10:29.580" style="s2">u.s. election in November 2016 to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.670" end="00:10:31.590" style="s2">contribute from Havana Festo guided by</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.590" end="00:10:38.100" style="s2">and I wrote a piece called the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.590" end="00:10:40.760" style="s2">flickering of hope and what I wrote in</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.100" end="00:10:43.860" style="s2">there was that when complex systems are</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.760" end="00:10:47.550" style="s2">ready to change when they&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.860" end="00:10:50.010" style="s2">point of breakdown potentially then what</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.550" end="00:10:52.530" style="s2">you find on those underlying attractors</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.010" end="00:10:56.250" style="s2">are showed earlier is you get the limits</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.530" end="00:10:59.370" style="s2">of the behavior of a system beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.250" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">just break down but you also get the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.370" end="00:11:06.200" style="s2">potential izing of a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:09.090" style="s2">coherence a possibility also forming and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.200" end="00:11:11.070" style="s2">what you have is what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.090" end="00:11:13.560" style="s2">bifurcation point but in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.070" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">bifurcation point which can be break</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.560" end="00:11:19.500" style="s2">down and/or break through you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:21.840" style="s2">something called flickering where there</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.500" end="00:11:24.120" style="s2">is a flickering between the old system</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.840" end="00:11:26.910" style="s2">that is essentially falling apart and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.120" end="00:11:29.460" style="s2">the potent izing of the the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.910" end="00:11:33.390" style="s2">of coherence and they flicker between</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.460" end="00:11:36.200" style="s2">the two and if there is sufficient if</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.390" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">you like consciousness it&#39;s a sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.200" end="00:11:42.660" style="s2">essence to that higher level coherence</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">the system streams through to that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.660" end="00:11:47.280" style="s2">that is essentially as we&#39;re finding in</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:48.250" style="s2">informational terms as well which of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.280" end="00:11:50.020" style="s2">course is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.250" end="00:11:53.050" style="s2">consciousness expressing itself as</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.020" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">information emergence is biological</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.050" end="00:11:58.330" style="s2">emergence so it seems to me that as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.110" end="00:12:01.000" style="s2">collective psyche as we are all</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.330" end="00:12:03.490" style="s2">interconnected there are areas of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.000" end="00:12:05.950" style="s2">collective psyche that has that still</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.490" end="00:12:07.540" style="s2">embodies trauma from all the appearance</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.950" end="00:12:11.140" style="s2">of separation that we&#39;ve been through</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.540" end="00:12:14.950" style="s2">for so long and that&#39;s energizing as it</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.140" end="00:12:17.710" style="s2">were the the current your unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.950" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">situation but there&#39;s also higher level</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.710" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">coherence as I go around the world I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">seeing incredible incredible movements</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.220" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">that are gaining momentum and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:30.310" style="s2">accelerating such as what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:33.280" style="s2">in the Hudson what Williams been doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.310" end="00:12:35.830" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been doing Daniel but across</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.280" end="00:12:37.210" style="s2">the world as well as the breakdown and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.830" end="00:12:38.920" style="s2">think we&#39;re in this time of flickering</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.210" end="00:12:42.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s almost as though were in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.920" end="00:12:44.110" style="s2">birth canal of conscious evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.580" end="00:12:46.870" style="s2">when we&#39;re in the birth canal I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.110" end="00:12:49.090" style="s2">mum but my mum used to help the local</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.870" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">Midwife and her advice was always</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.090" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">breathe and push so there has the sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:12:58.360" style="s2">I have and I think that&#39;s the sense on</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:13:00.310" style="s2">the political side as well cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.360" end="00:13:02.710" style="s2">seeing that and it&#39;s on the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.310" end="00:13:10.780" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about Roger as well thank</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.710" end="00:13:13.540" style="s2">you I&#39;ve got two thoughts one is always</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.780" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">always always keep on campaigning keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.540" end="00:13:24.370" style="s2">on campaigning keep on campaigning yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.980" end="00:13:28.200" style="s2">simultaneously step back and celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.370" end="00:13:33.640" style="s2">the level of debate that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.200" end="00:13:37.930" style="s2">because the apparent disaster is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:40.390" style="s2">going on silently there are huge</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.930" end="00:13:42.300" style="s2">arguments there are huge debates they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.390" end="00:13:45.160" style="s2">huge pushes to get appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.300" end="00:13:47.260" style="s2">legislation in battles will be lost</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.160" end="00:13:49.720" style="s2">apparently Wars occasionally will be</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.260" end="00:13:53.070" style="s2">lost but keep on campaigning and keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.720" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">your eye on the fact that it&#39;s a hot</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.070" end="00:13:58.450" style="s2">subject and that&#39;s to be celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:02.279" style="s2">nobody is going through all this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.450" end="00:14:05.589" style="s2">apathetically and that for me is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.279" end="00:14:10.089" style="s2">huge indication that humanity as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.589" end="00:14:13.449" style="s2">is waking up to its self responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.089" end="00:14:15.670" style="s2">in relation to its environment so keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.449" end="00:14:17.740" style="s2">on campaigning but don&#39;t get depressed</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.670" end="00:14:19.209" style="s2">by the bad news because you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.740" end="00:14:22.059" style="s2">depressed by the bad news you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.209" end="00:14:24.730" style="s2">going to shovel more shit on to it you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.059" end="00:14:26.499" style="s2">know the vibe doesn&#39;t work keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.730" end="00:14:29.829" style="s2">campaigning and hang out with people</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.499" end="00:14:32.230" style="s2">who&#39;ve got a an eye on the long picture</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.829" end="00:14:47.709" style="s2">and the fact that it it&#39;s tough now but</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.230" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll be ok I I have to check in with</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.709" end="00:14:52.990" style="s2">myself because that&#39;s really like locus</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:55.559" style="s2">of control that I have in how am I</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.990" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">dealing with these questions which are</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.559" end="00:15:02.559" style="s2">large and challenging and it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:05.139" style="s2">easy to become cynical in the political</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.559" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">sphere especially in the country that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.139" end="00:15:13.689" style="s2">I&#39;m from and I feel that in this process</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:18.490" style="s2">of becoming human which I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.689" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">still on that journey where we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.490" end="00:15:25.870" style="s2">connect to our deepest source of who we</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:28.870" style="s2">are and my dear friend Otto Sharma would</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.870" end="00:15:32.379" style="s2">say we need to approach that with an</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.870" end="00:15:35.290" style="s2">open mind open heart and open will and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.379" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">it&#39;s our own voices of judgment our own</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.290" end="00:15:40.149" style="s2">voices of cynicism and our own voices of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.170" end="00:15:42.550" style="s2">fear that will prevent us from doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.149" end="00:15:48.040" style="s2">that so this is what I have to do I know</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.550" end="00:15:50.110" style="s2">the work that I have to do I just want</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.040" end="00:15:53.529" style="s2">to equal this internal locus of control</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.110" end="00:15:55.149" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the key principles of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.529" end="00:15:59.949" style="s2">regenerative development is that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.149" end="00:16:05.470" style="s2">starts within and to be facing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.949" end="00:16:08.170" style="s2">current political situation in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.470" end="00:16:11.790" style="s2">countries what&#39;s going on in Brazil as</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.170" end="00:16:13.520" style="s2">well at the moment is very concerning I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.790" end="00:16:16.220" style="s2">think</p>
