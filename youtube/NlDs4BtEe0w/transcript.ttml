<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">becoming popular because it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.650" end="00:00:18.930" style="s2">essential our survival may depend upon</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">this work and doesn&#39;t have to be one</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:23.189" style="s2">individual at a time for it to work is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:25.650" style="s2">there a way for us to do shadow work on</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.189" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">a more collective level well I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.650" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve played with this we certainly</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">have and integrals in we do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">group shadow work yes it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">where it gets really complicated are</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">where the collective shadows the group</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">shadows like the green shadow starts</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">interfering with the shadow work you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">doing with individuals can you expand on</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:01:00.120" style="s2">that a little bit how does that look</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:01:01.739" style="s2">well yes I don&#39;t know let&#39;s let me just</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.120" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">approach this without using any</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.739" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">technical jargon but I&#39;m a Zen master I</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">have a rather authoritarian leadership</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">style which actually I mean there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">kinds of psychological reasons for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">but we don&#39;t need to go into those I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">happy to but we don&#39;t need to I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:31.490" style="s2">lightning rod for projections from this</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">green collective shadow where</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.490" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">authoritarian hierarchical leaders are</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">taboo that is a collective shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">I&#39;m a lightning rod for that shadow I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">get it all the time so in order for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">to survive and have green students come</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:54.649" style="s2">in we have to have collective ways of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.140" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">dealing with this collective shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.649" end="00:01:59.969" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed some some collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">shadow work some group shadow work where</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.969" end="00:02:05.579" style="s2">we we really talk about these shadows</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">and we work on them and we help people</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.579" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">become conscious of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:18.050" style="s2">one of the practices we have called</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:21.230" style="s2">embodying them and it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.050" end="00:02:24.090" style="s2">only talking about things that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.230" end="00:02:26.820" style="s2">immediately experienceable by your</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">senses so this is the collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.820" end="00:02:31.350" style="s2">agreement and we sit in a circle and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:33.450" style="s2">go around the circle and we say</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.350" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">something but it has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.450" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in real time and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:43.820" style="s2">input has to come from our five senses</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:50.070" style="s2">and what becomes immediately evident is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.820" end="00:02:51.570" style="s2">how important people stories are because</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.070" end="00:02:53.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.570" end="00:02:56.190" style="s2">only things that you can immediately</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:02:59.550" style="s2">experience you&#39;re not pulling anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.190" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">out of your mind or any emotions out and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.550" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">telling a story about it because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">not real time that&#39;s a form of group</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:15.380" style="s2">work that is really effective at helping</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">people see and realize for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.380" end="00:03:23.010" style="s2">how addicted to their stories they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:24.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s a great beginning right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.010" end="00:03:26.460" style="s2">certainly we we went there from there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:28.890" style="s2">the individual level someone doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.460" end="00:03:31.740" style="s2">shadow work by themselves you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.890" end="00:03:33.060" style="s2">as a group but in terms of a wider</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.740" end="00:03:35.640" style="s2">culture because there&#39;s millions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.060" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">people out there and a lot of them well</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.640" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">a lot of us I don&#39;t go to these types of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:44.870" style="s2">groups yeah so I&#39;m curious around do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:47.970" style="s2">see any way that a culture as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.870" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">can start to look at its shadow it is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.970" end="00:03:54.030" style="s2">it have to be done face-to-face nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:57.830" style="s2">has a way of of helping us with these</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.030" end="00:04:03.990" style="s2">problems when great shadows accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.830" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">it&#39;s called war do you know what causes</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.990" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">peace tell me war</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.490" end="00:04:20.290" style="s2">is that the only way well so far and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.220" end="00:04:24.700" style="s2">this massive scale that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.290" end="00:04:28.950" style="s2">about I don&#39;t think were evolved enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.700" end="00:04:32.250" style="s2">to do it on this massive a scale so</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.950" end="00:04:36.730" style="s2">nature takes care of it for us</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.250" end="00:04:39.760" style="s2">interesting and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.730" end="00:04:43.930" style="s2">gives me great hope is we may have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.760" end="00:04:46.470" style="s2">find a way to do this to survive when do</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.930" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">we change as my teacher always asked and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:53.410" style="s2">then his answer was when we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:55.030" style="s2">certainly been true in my development</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.410" end="00:04:57.160" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.030" end="00:04:58.540" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about war there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.160" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">question I wanted to ask you which was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.540" end="00:05:04.450" style="s2">around just death in general in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:07.720" style="s2">culture death seems to me and always has</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.450" end="00:05:09.850" style="s2">to be one of the only certainties we</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.720" end="00:05:11.650" style="s2">have and I find I take great solace in</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.850" end="00:05:14.860" style="s2">that there&#39;s a certain theme through</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.650" end="00:05:17.860" style="s2">meditation practice also meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.860" end="00:05:19.540" style="s2">related to death what do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.860" end="00:05:22.120" style="s2">shadow that we seem to have around death</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.540" end="00:05:28.660" style="s2">in our culture does throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.120" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">culture we avoid it like the plague I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.660" end="00:05:33.460" style="s2">a lot of death and dying work you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">Zen is known for its relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.460" end="00:05:42.220" style="s2">death we say die before you die so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:44.920" style="s2">you can live I do a workshop that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.220" end="00:05:47.530" style="s2">love to do because death is a Dharma</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.920" end="00:05:49.780" style="s2">gate you know we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.530" end="00:05:52.930" style="s2">meditation being the old standard way</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.780" end="00:05:56.680" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a more effective Dharma</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.930" end="00:06:01.270" style="s2">gate than meditation it&#39;s called a brush</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.680" end="00:06:06.010" style="s2">with death it&#39;s a huge opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.270" end="00:06:11.170" style="s2">open into the great mystery so I start</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.010" end="00:06:14.050" style="s2">this workshop with a question isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.170" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">interesting that we all know we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:19.960" style="s2">die do you know you&#39;re gonna die yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:24.950" style="s2">and none of us believe it</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.960" end="00:06:26.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t that interesting why is that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.950" end="00:06:30.830" style="s2">is going on here</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.530" end="00:06:33.350" style="s2">so this body&#39;s gonna die I&#39;m fairly</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.830" end="00:06:36.200" style="s2">certain that&#39;s true now there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.350" end="00:06:39.350" style="s2">be overwhelming evidence that tells me</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.200" end="00:06:42.280" style="s2">my body is gonna die I&#39;m also fairly</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.350" end="00:06:46.940" style="s2">certain my precious ego is going to die</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.280" end="00:06:51.560" style="s2">because it&#39;s connected to the body what</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.940" end="00:06:54.460" style="s2">is it that was never born and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.560" end="00:06:54.460" style="s2">will never die</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.300" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">if we cut away all your thoughts all</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.470" end="00:07:10.790" style="s2">your feelings all your stories if we ask</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:13.040" style="s2">you who are you really and every time</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.790" end="00:07:15.590" style="s2">you answer I hold up the mirror and say</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.040" end="00:07:17.800" style="s2">I ask you who you are and you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.590" end="00:07:20.090" style="s2">what you think isn&#39;t that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.800" end="00:07:23.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t that interesting can you go deeper</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.090" end="00:07:25.640" style="s2">than thought and you do you go deeper</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.630" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">than thought and you find what you feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.640" end="00:07:30.350" style="s2">and I say interesting first you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:35.590" style="s2">what you think then you tell me what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:39.320" style="s2">feel can you go deeper than feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.590" end="00:07:42.170" style="s2">eventually as you said your mind will</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.320" end="00:07:45.770" style="s2">tie itself in knots what did you call it</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.170" end="00:07:47.300" style="s2">a thought bomb yeah the thought bomb</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.770" end="00:07:49.870" style="s2">will go off and there&#39;ll be nothing</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.300" end="00:07:53.480" style="s2">there and you&#39;ll tell me the truth that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.870" end="00:07:57.170" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know who you are and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.480" end="00:07:58.470" style="s2">then we get excited now we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.170" end="00:08:01.930" style="s2">nowhere finally</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.470" end="00:08:07.389" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.930" end="00:08:13.389" style="s2">and we look into the mystery this don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.180" end="00:09:09.060" style="s2">clothes how many times was this</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.370" end="00:09:15.520" style="s2">awareness abandoned in the forest and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.060" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">eaten by wolves and how is that related</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.520" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">to your fear of being abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.750" end="00:09:32.230" style="s2">now we&#39;re getting nowhere and fast and</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.570" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">showing up cleaning up growing up and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.800" end="00:09:47.860" style="s2">waking up so that sounds to me like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:50.290" style="s2">waking up process what what I&#39;m struck</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.860" end="00:09:52.510" style="s2">by is that people like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.290" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">have had a very strong grow up message</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.510" end="00:09:56.470" style="s2">and I guess a clean up message look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:59.980" style="s2">your stuff you clean outlook yeah clean</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.470" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">out your shadows yeah what do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.980" end="00:10:03.339" style="s2">the culture needs right now of those or</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:05.470" style="s2">is it all of them is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.339" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">particular that the culture is begging</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.470" end="00:10:12.700" style="s2">for all of them and we&#39;ve added one more</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:14.200" style="s2">mm-hmm it&#39;s essential to wake up this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.700" end="00:10:14.860" style="s2">the most important thing because this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.200" end="00:10:20.770" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.860" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">whar growing up continuing to evolve is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.770" end="00:10:29.880" style="s2">also essential if you stay stuck and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:33.430" style="s2">uninvolved you stay stuck and unevolved</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.880" end="00:10:38.460" style="s2">you stay where you are the one that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.430" end="00:10:41.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve added right here is up I</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.460" end="00:10:44.020" style="s2">don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.560" end="00:10:49.180" style="s2">everything I know by making mistakes if</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.020" end="00:10:53.320" style="s2">I can&#39;t up I can&#39;t learn I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.180" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">terrified of not up now if I am</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.320" end="00:10:57.430" style="s2">shopping for a brain surgeon I want one</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.510" end="00:11:01.870" style="s2">that already knows I don&#39;t want one</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.430" end="00:11:04.660" style="s2">that&#39;s in the upstage and if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:08.110" style="s2">shopping for a Zen master there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.660" end="00:11:11.620" style="s2">truth to there too if I&#39;m shopping for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.110" end="00:11:14.410" style="s2">therapist but I don&#39;t want one that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.620" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">rigid they&#39;re unable to take risks and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.410" end="00:11:18.940" style="s2">work with me that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:21.790" style="s2">terrified of up because you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.940" end="00:11:25.690" style="s2">gonna up that&#39;s why the next one</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.790" end="00:11:28.110" style="s2">cleaning up is important as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.690" end="00:11:31.270" style="s2">realize you up and you&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.110" end="00:11:34.180" style="s2">what&#39;s going to be helpful for you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.270" end="00:11:36.810" style="s2">continue then you clean it up very</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.180" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">quickly as efficiently as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.810" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">only then can you show up as a fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">awake evolved compassionate human being</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.890" end="00:11:53.290" style="s2">so all of those processes the the waking</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:55.660" style="s2">up the showing up the growing up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.290" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2"> up all of them have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.660" end="00:12:00.790" style="s2">developmental quality to them all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:02.680" style="s2">integral is all a developmental model we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.790" end="00:12:05.230" style="s2">are moving towards something an</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.680" end="00:12:06.850" style="s2">evolution and development is core to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.230" end="00:12:10.590" style="s2">existence I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.850" end="00:12:12.610" style="s2">great gifts of what integral is shown</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.590" end="00:12:16.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve often talked amongst ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.610" end="00:12:18.790" style="s2">around that the developmental model</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.300" end="00:12:20.230" style="s2">isn&#39;t so present in the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.790" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">conversations that we&#39;re covering often</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.230" end="00:12:23.860" style="s2">with the intellectual darkweb it is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:25.990" style="s2">bit with jordan peterson he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.860" end="00:12:28.839" style="s2">for example Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.990" end="00:12:30.820" style="s2">why is something like integral important</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.839" end="00:12:38.170" style="s2">why is it important to see the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.820" end="00:12:41.860" style="s2">developmentally do you think I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.170" end="00:12:46.149" style="s2">it&#39;s critical to move out of I&#39;m right</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.860" end="00:12:49.089" style="s2">and you&#39;re wrong space the whole problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.149" end="00:12:51.910" style="s2">with all what our so-called first tier</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.089" end="00:12:54.670" style="s2">levels of development which is through</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.910" end="00:12:56.550" style="s2">green is that they all believe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.670" end="00:13:03.640" style="s2">right and everybody else is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.550" end="00:13:08.020" style="s2">nobody&#39;s that smart what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.640" end="00:13:11.190" style="s2">you go beyond that is you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.020" end="00:13:16.839" style="s2">this is an evolutionary sequence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.190" end="00:13:19.510" style="s2">that one stage is more right than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.839" end="00:13:21.880" style="s2">stage before it and the stage after it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.510" end="00:13:24.130" style="s2">is more right than the stage before it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.880" end="00:13:27.880" style="s2">and the stage after it is more right</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.130" end="00:13:35.560" style="s2">than the stage before it what gets real</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.880" end="00:13:41.580" style="s2">tricky is as Piaget was so good at</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.560" end="00:13:48.040" style="s2">displaying the capacity to see and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.580" end="00:13:51.010" style="s2">evolve has to happen and the way to look</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.040" end="00:13:54.010" style="s2">at this is to look at it that when the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.010" end="00:13:57.490" style="s2">ego first shows up that&#39;s a first person</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.010" end="00:14:02.940" style="s2">perspective I&#39;m not capable yet of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.490" end="00:14:02.940" style="s2">taking a second person perspective if</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:13.819" style="s2">if I show this to a three-year-old I say</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.040" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">what color do you see like what color do</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.819" end="00:14:20.470" style="s2">you see what what color do I see white</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:28.339" style="s2">but the three-year-old says black</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.470" end="00:14:31.180" style="s2">there&#39;s no ability to abstractly take a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.339" end="00:14:34.699" style="s2">second person perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.180" end="00:14:36.829" style="s2">theoretically see what I&#39;m seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.699" end="00:14:39.259" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen until about five or six</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.829" end="00:14:41.509" style="s2">years old and that&#39;s where we start</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.259" end="00:14:44.930" style="s2">getting enculturated into our parents</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.509" end="00:14:48.110" style="s2">belief system so this is really an</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.930" end="00:14:52.490" style="s2">important thing to understand if the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.110" end="00:14:55.399" style="s2">capacity to see isn&#39;t there a second</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.490" end="00:14:58.759" style="s2">person perspective there&#39;s no way I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.399" end="00:15:01.819" style="s2">teach you to do that you have to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.759" end="00:15:03.800" style="s2">the capacity the third person</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.819" end="00:15:06.680" style="s2">perspective which happens about puberty</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.800" end="00:15:11.889" style="s2">and happened in the Enlightenment in our</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.680" end="00:15:15.949" style="s2">culture this has the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.889" end="00:15:18.290" style="s2">operational thinking right now we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.949" end="00:15:22.100" style="s2">abstract rules they don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.290" end="00:15:25.759" style="s2">concrete they can they can be more</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.100" end="00:15:29.930" style="s2">abstract and I can theorize the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.759" end="00:15:32.899" style="s2">scientific method is born if I only have</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.930" end="00:15:36.290" style="s2">a second person perspective like common</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.899" end="00:15:38.930" style="s2">people in the Middle Ages there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.290" end="00:15:42.259" style="s2">possibility that I could develop a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.930" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">scientific methodology I don&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:50.870" style="s2">into post modernity what we&#39;re referring</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.259" end="00:15:53.329" style="s2">to is the green altitude you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.870" end="00:15:55.399" style="s2">have a fourth person perspective which</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.329" end="00:15:59.329" style="s2">is you have to be capable of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.399" end="00:16:02.089" style="s2">systems theory and you see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.329" end="00:16:04.610" style="s2">system in which the third person</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.089" end="00:16:07.490" style="s2">perspective is embodied in that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.610" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">fourth person perspective the reason</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:15.350" style="s2">problems is he does not have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.860" end="00:16:18.510" style="s2">capacity to take a fourth person</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.350" end="00:16:21.870" style="s2">perspective he can&#39;t see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.510" end="00:16:24.420" style="s2">that these problems are embedded in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.870" end="00:16:26.810" style="s2">that&#39;s been true of many scientists</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.420" end="00:16:29.880" style="s2">until the evidence is so overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.810" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">that they can no longer argue with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.880" end="00:16:35.130" style="s2">it&#39;s true a businessmen they don&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.340" end="00:16:46.470" style="s2">a fourth person perspective now the</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.470" end="00:16:53.610" style="s2">evolutionary perspective and very few</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.490" end="00:16:55.470" style="s2">people have the capacity to see the</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.470" end="00:17:00.840" style="s2">perspectives so you can preach you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.350" end="00:17:03.030" style="s2">talk you could twist their arm you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.840" end="00:17:08.760" style="s2">insult them you can bribe them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.030" end="00:17:10.410" style="s2">nothing helps until they&#39;ve evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.760" end="00:17:15.000" style="s2">the point where they&#39;re ready and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.410" end="00:17:19.560" style="s2">have the capacity so my final question</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:22.980" style="s2">is what is what do you feel is the main</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.560" end="00:17:25.079" style="s2">thing standing in the way of us taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.980" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">that step taking that evolution to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.079" end="00:17:29.570" style="s2">kind of perspective as a species right</p>
