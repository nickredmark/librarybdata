<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">but coz also capable of a profound deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:09.470" style="s2">answer and there&#39;s personally relevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:13.209" style="s2">to you that what I recommend is Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.470" end="00:02:16.329" style="s2">you treat every answer as it comes up</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.209" end="00:02:19.659" style="s2">with gratitude and as a portal that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.329" end="00:02:22.269" style="s2">portends what is beyond because what</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.659" end="00:02:25.930" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to train here is vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.269" end="00:02:27.970" style="s2">a kind of exploratory observation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.930" end="00:02:30.489" style="s2">asking this question not to fill in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.970" end="00:02:32.260" style="s2">hole but we doing normally asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.489" end="00:02:34.060" style="s2">questions of our ignorance we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.260" end="00:02:36.849" style="s2">to deep the hole deeper and deeper until</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.060" end="00:02:38.950" style="s2">the bottom falls away and we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.849" end="00:02:40.780" style="s2">depths because we&#39;re no longer just</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.950" end="00:02:43.180" style="s2">looking at the surface of the pond that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.780" end="00:02:45.730" style="s2">we begin to become too calm we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.180" end="00:02:49.420" style="s2">to be passing a deep insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.730" end="00:02:52.659" style="s2">depths of the pond treat every answer as</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.420" end="00:02:54.670" style="s2">with gratitude but as a lens that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.659" end="00:02:57.190" style="s2">see through as a doorway that you pass</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.670" end="00:03:00.459" style="s2">through as you go on the quest to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.190" end="00:03:03.010" style="s2">right deep into the unfamiliar depths</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.459" end="00:03:06.370" style="s2">the point of the practice is not to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:08.439" style="s2">an answer no matter how insightful but</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.370" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">to be filling fill your eyes and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.439" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">automatic ignition if you&#39;re distracted</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.490" end="00:20:15.590" style="s2">clearing my mind any tips for allowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.740" end="00:20:17.390" style="s2">oneself to think again but we did today</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.590" end="00:20:25.850" style="s2">I think there was a question leftover</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.390" end="00:20:28.549" style="s2">from yesterday uh so I&#39;m not cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.850" end="00:20:29.929" style="s2">quite clear what you mean so I hope I</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.669" end="00:20:39.799" style="s2">there were there was no motion movement</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.110" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">of mind and that&#39;s what clearing your</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.799" end="00:20:46.909" style="s2">mind meant I hope that you weren&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:48.890" style="s2">of holding thoughts away but because if</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.909" end="00:20:51.470" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of holding things away</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.890" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">that&#39;s not really conducive to what we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.470" end="00:20:56.210" style="s2">walk because what you want to do is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.260" end="00:20:58.970" style="s2">want to fact and maybe this is what you</p>
