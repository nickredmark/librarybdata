<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:12.049" style="s2">questions at time to questions about</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">this course that we&#39;re all on together</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.049" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">for more encompassing questions please</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:20.909" style="s2">come to my general Q&amp;A that&#39;s livestream</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">on YouTube every third Friday of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.909" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">month to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:32.310" style="s2">will be July some teeth I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">it for announcements right now and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.310" end="00:01:38.189" style="s2">let&#39;s get into the Dharma practice for</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">today this is another layering practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.189" end="00:01:44.369" style="s2">and it&#39;s also a linking practice you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">see how it layers are I think of aspects</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.369" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">of Praja</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">but you&#39;ll also see how it links again</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">between mindfulness and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">propositioning based processing and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">in a similar way you&#39;ll find that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:02:02.100" style="s2">sort of resonates and the pun is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">intended with lectio divina so the point</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">about chanting is we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:11.489" style="s2">trying to do something that&#39;s more a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:13.160" style="s2">little bit more musical and why that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.489" end="00:02:15.830" style="s2">matters is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.160" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">music is one of the fundamental ways in</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.830" end="00:02:22.840" style="s2">which we play with how things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:25.340" style="s2">salient to us and and it&#39;s also how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:26.510" style="s2">play with the machinery by which we make</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:28.970" style="s2">sense of things how things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.510" end="00:02:32.630" style="s2">intelligible to us so it&#39;s getting it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.970" end="00:02:35.060" style="s2">the root and chanting because it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.630" end="00:02:37.820" style="s2">linguistic of course we&#39;ll engage the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.060" end="00:02:43.070" style="s2">left hemisphere but because it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.820" end="00:02:46.150" style="s2">musical pattern open-ended engages the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.070" end="00:02:49.790" style="s2">right hemisphere that&#39;s very conducive</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.150" end="00:02:52.100" style="s2">as you can imagine for increased insight</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.790" end="00:02:54.860" style="s2">because instead as a boat by getting a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:02:57.800" style="s2">dynamic integration between the left and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.860" end="00:02:59.720" style="s2">right hemispheres chanting is also</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.800" end="00:03:02.750" style="s2">important for what Winkelmann calls</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.720" end="00:03:04.730" style="s2">neuro neural axial integration so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.750" end="00:03:08.960" style="s2">is integration from sort of the higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.730" end="00:03:11.180" style="s2">cortex areas down to the basic areas of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.960" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">brain stem music has that capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.180" end="00:03:17.810" style="s2">that music as a capacity there because</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:19.520" style="s2">its resonant to integrate the inner and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.810" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">the outer this is why we have this</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.520" end="00:03:25.430" style="s2">notion of enchanting something doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:32.200" style="s2">magic and chanting it filling it with</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:36.580" style="s2">power or meaning so there&#39;s a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.200" end="00:03:39.140" style="s2">bring to mind in your intention to chant</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.580" end="00:03:41.750" style="s2">so the difficulty with chanting this</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.140" end="00:03:43.640" style="s2">well the line lane why are you giving me</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.750" end="00:03:45.620" style="s2">all this theory I&#39;m laying all this in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.640" end="00:03:49.810" style="s2">because not because I want you to oh I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.620" end="00:03:54.260" style="s2">want you to build a very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.810" end="00:03:56.690" style="s2">intent for chanting because chanting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.260" end="00:04:01.820" style="s2">the setting scent of chanting is to fall</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.690" end="00:04:04.550" style="s2">into sort of ball we just saw you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.820" end="00:04:06.020" style="s2">that you can do that very easily but if</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.550" end="00:04:08.810" style="s2">you remember everything you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.020" end="00:04:12.020" style="s2">activate and access and accentuate with</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.810" end="00:04:15.740" style="s2">chanting then it&#39;ll go much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.020" end="00:04:20.480" style="s2">transformative for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.740" end="00:04:24.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s very important that you let your</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.480" end="00:04:25.670" style="s2">stomach be open and belly breathing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.200" end="00:04:30.350" style="s2">also very important that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.670" end="00:04:31.880" style="s2">hyperventilate so again try to keep your</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.350" end="00:04:33.500" style="s2">breathing now you&#39;re gonna be breathing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.880" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">differently than you normally do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.500" end="00:04:37.370" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be taking in breaths and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.030" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">that uses your out-breath to chant but</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.370" end="00:04:44.150" style="s2">make sure you&#39;re not getting that sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">of of a thinness to your breath and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.150" end="00:04:49.100" style="s2">lightheadedness you don&#39;t want that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:50.110" style="s2">should always feel that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.100" end="00:04:53.660" style="s2">well-rounded</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.110" end="00:04:56.060" style="s2">so typically we won&#39;t do this right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.660" end="00:05:00.110" style="s2">but typically where I find chanting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.060" end="00:05:02.330" style="s2">sort of fit in best is not all my moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.110" end="00:05:05.450" style="s2">practices of the cheek on Dee John John</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.330" end="00:05:10.600" style="s2">Dee chuan I saw a gun the sitted cheek</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.450" end="00:05:13.670" style="s2">on I done the routing I&#39;ve done flow and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.600" end="00:05:16.820" style="s2">then I go into chanting thought I go</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.670" end="00:05:19.730" style="s2">into chanting so what you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.820" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">is you&#39;re going to inhale and then as</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.730" end="00:05:24.470" style="s2">your exhale you&#39;re going to chant now</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:27.110" style="s2">when you do so that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.470" end="00:05:29.330" style="s2">emphasize for me and I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.110" end="00:05:31.010" style="s2">introduce something to you again it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">integrative practice and it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.010" end="00:05:37.700" style="s2">to also bridge between the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:39.140" style="s2">course that were on and the Western</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.700" end="00:05:41.090" style="s2">course we&#39;re going to take up with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.140" end="00:05:43.550" style="s2">the way the wisdom of Hypatia so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.090" end="00:05:46.480" style="s2">where I have chosen this one and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.550" end="00:05:52.010" style="s2">also one that for me it resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.480" end="00:05:54.260" style="s2">the two symbols that I carry around so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.010" end="00:05:57.890" style="s2">we&#39;re going to use from the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.260" end="00:06:00.530" style="s2">tradition ohm as one aspect of the chant</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.890" end="00:06:04.420" style="s2">and from the Western tradition one</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.530" end="00:06:07.480" style="s2">because the one the oneness of things is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.420" end="00:06:12.890" style="s2">right so the epitome of the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.480" end="00:06:16.310" style="s2">wisdom tradition Oh has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.890" end="00:06:19.040" style="s2">grounding the emergence the flowing into</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.310" end="00:06:21.710" style="s2">existence of things one has to do of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.040" end="00:06:25.820" style="s2">course with the oneness of things the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.710" end="00:06:27.710" style="s2">oneness of things ohm is chanted lower</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.820" end="00:06:29.740" style="s2">so it sounds like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.710" end="00:06:29.740" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.440" end="00:06:39.760" style="s2">and notice what I&#39;m doing so sorry my</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.030" end="00:06:42.730" style="s2">mouth is sort of rounded sometimes one</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.760" end="00:06:44.140" style="s2">was actually spelled a um oh and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.730" end="00:06:46.810" style="s2">want a bit of that rounding in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.140" end="00:06:49.480" style="s2">mouth and you don&#39;t want the chance to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.810" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">end with your mouth coming closed right</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.480" end="00:06:57.370" style="s2">if that&#39;s half way through the chat so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:07:00.790" style="s2">it&#39;s oh so I take a breath um see I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.370" end="00:07:03.220" style="s2">I&#39;m rounding to closure sorry I have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.790" end="00:07:04.630" style="s2">talk and interrupt the chair I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.220" end="00:07:06.340" style="s2">I need a hand puppet or something over</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.630" end="00:07:09.490" style="s2">here champion taught you something</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.340" end="00:07:14.590" style="s2">but anyways right when I get here I want</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.490" end="00:07:19.690" style="s2">to continue on with them so the AH part</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.590" end="00:07:21.610" style="s2">is out right and then the mm is in and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.690" end="00:07:23.350" style="s2">you want to feel the vibration in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.610" end="00:07:25.150" style="s2">chest and your abdomen as much as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.350" end="00:07:26.980" style="s2">can and you&#39;re trying to get it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.339" end="00:11:58.260" style="s2">just a rhythmic like a almost like a</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.560" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">be a way of embodying that richness</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.310" end="00:12:22.410" style="s2">China to think of this as a musical</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.510" end="00:12:36.600" style="s2">do it collectively because that then</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.440" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">brings out the final dimension that on</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.350" end="00:12:53.339" style="s2">that the various chants take on a life</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.570" end="00:30:30.570" style="s2">can I recommend you do Lexie Oh Davina</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.509" end="00:30:34.130" style="s2">after whichever sit at practice you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.570" end="00:30:36.899" style="s2">so I think of chanting as going from</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.130" end="00:30:39.210" style="s2">conceptual propositional into</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.899" end="00:30:41.549" style="s2">mindfulness and I think of Lexi Oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.210" end="00:30:45.480" style="s2">Davina as a helpful way of moving out</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.549" end="00:30:48.630" style="s2">from mindfulness back into more</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.480" end="00:30:53.130" style="s2">propositional conceptual thought so</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.630" end="00:30:54.779" style="s2">chanting chanting in and poesis the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.130" end="00:30:59.009" style="s2">making it&#39;s at the root of our word</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.779" end="00:31:00.899" style="s2">poetry the making poesis coming out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.009" end="00:31:02.879" style="s2">of course there&#39;s deep connections of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.899" end="00:31:11.700" style="s2">course between chanting and poesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.879" end="00:31:15.269" style="s2">poetry so I recommend that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.700" end="00:31:19.169" style="s2">teach you also walking next time of day</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.269" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">a walking meditation and I recommend you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.169" end="00:31:27.299" style="s2">use that in conjunction with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:34.590" style="s2">standing chicon practices and before you</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.299" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">sit again that one i I do Tai Chi every</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.590" end="00:31:40.200" style="s2">day you could do the walking every day</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:42.090" style="s2">if you wish or I recommend doing at</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.200" end="00:31:44.610" style="s2">least two or three times a day because</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.090" end="00:31:46.860" style="s2">it&#39;s also an important bridging practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.610" end="00:31:49.009" style="s2">between being seated or standing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.860" end="00:31:54.990" style="s2">moving around to the world and taking</p>
