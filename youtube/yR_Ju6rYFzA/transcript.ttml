<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">of my earlier podcasts on</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">uh covid related topics know that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">often frame the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">uh in complex systems terms when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">about hysteresis</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">and homeostasis which which are two</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">terms we use</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">that when a system receives a shock</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">means the tendency for it to return to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">its previous state to essentially buffer</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">the shock</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">and things get back to normal may take a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:42.319" style="s2">while hysteresis on the other hand is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">term originally from physics</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">physics that when a shock to a complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">system is of sufficient magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">it never comes back and when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">thinking about these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">uh effects around the pandemic uh you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">know i like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">think about hysteresis what are</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">homeostasis which things will come back</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">and hysteresis which things will never</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">come back or at least will never come</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">back totally they&#39;ll go on a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">uh and uh you know if i were to put down</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">a bet i put down at least a small one</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">that with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">uh you know traditional high dollar</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">big city office space uh we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">hysteresis</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">at least as much as homeostasis i kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">of doubt it&#39;s going to come back what</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">are your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re in the when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">in the middle of the shock</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">then uh i i think that you&#39;re you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">silly and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">to have a sensible uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">uh balanced appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">of what of what of what the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">impacts are going to be like</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">like in in sure you can think will this</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">ever end</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">is this ever going to end and things</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">things seem like and if</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">if history is an example uh prior</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">pandemics 1918</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">we did go straight into the roaring 20s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">um and and so you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s um that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">antecedent we have to look at but</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing now is is that time is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">not standing</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">still so companies are taking stock</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">of how um how their</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.479" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">businesses have gone during this period</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">uh uh adjustments using zoom and other</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">uh video conferencing um uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:41.759" style="s2">systems and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">you know so my own my own company medium</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.759" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">just announced last friday we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">going back to the office</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">uh at least until this time next year</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">one more year</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">like this and uh and and so i have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">wonder if the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">uh the uh hysteresis</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">thesis uh uh at least to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">is appropriate here simply because</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">companies see an upside in uh in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">in embracing home from work indeed</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">and i think the other thing uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">really important to think about when</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">we&#39;re considering these questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">as compared to 1918 uh the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">technical substrate really does make a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">big difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">you know in 1918 there weren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">any choices other than</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">uh going back to the office uh today</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">uh with you know things like the</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">and lots of interesting and cool other</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">technologies that are just about to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">emerge like</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">vr conferencing etc uh there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.919" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">alternative and in fact uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve been arguing for some time that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">business travel was stuck</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">in a sticky uh global sub-optima there</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">was really no reason for as much</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">business travel as we&#39;ve had at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">since</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">maybe 2010 or 11 when uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">inexpensive or nearly free uh video</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">conferencing came out and reliable</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">video conferencing came on the scene but</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">you know there&#39;s habit and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">uh signaling right i&#39;m not showing you</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">the proper</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">respect and deference if i don&#39;t travel</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">out to california to sit down with you</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">sell you a five million dollar software</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">package uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">when uh the shock to the system comes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">gave an excuse for people to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">that sub-optima or instead of spending</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">you know three days and two thousand</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">dollars to make uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">two sales calls uh one could make uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">20 sales calls in the same amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">and so the being knocked out of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">basin of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">uh essentially allowed us to escape the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">previous stickiness</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">uh that i believe a lot of it was around</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">uh you know signaling social signaling</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">uh people&#39;s relative importance and such</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">those may have the makings uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">of hysteresis because it&#39;s not really in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">anybody&#39;s interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">uh i&#39;d much rather talk to some sales</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">guy over zoom than have his uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">sweaty and greasy self in my office</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">right and as the sales guy himself</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">uh he could be way more efficient uh if</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">be traveling around the country so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">know i think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">uh kind of cultural inertia kept us in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">some of these uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">basins and the shock allowed the marble</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">to fly out of the bowl</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">yeah this is jim such an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">this use your your use of this term uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">social signaling because</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">this is absolutely a key uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">a key factor in this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">business travel</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">if you were in in an important meeting</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s very awkward to butt in</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">and you were a second class citizen you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">you were not</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">if you wanted to be in uh to be really</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">in on decision making you more or less</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">had to be there but</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">kovid has turned everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">no matter where they are into equal</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">uh equal citizens in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">meeting and uh that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">that&#39;s likely to uh you know to to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">linger</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">when this is all over indeed and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s become very clear because i do</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:57.920" style="s2">probably uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">10 to 15 zooms a week in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.920" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">two or three podcasts a week or usually</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">two but sometimes more</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve noticed people are getting better</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">at it right and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">uh adaptation and social learning around</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">how to use these tools</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">uh and again that&#39;s uh you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">trajectory dependent</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">uh evolution you know if we hadn&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">covid uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">the thing you described effectively i</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">can still recall uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">really hating to be on board meetings</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">remotely right because you were so</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2">ineffective compared to being there</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">uh in person right and i would just</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">frankly just</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">say no i&#39;m not gonna come on the zoom</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">i&#39;ll come in on the audio and just</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">listen and uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">you know play othello or something while</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">the meeting was going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">right uh but now we&#39;ve all gotten way</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">better at it so again that uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">reinforces the trajectory it&#39;s cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">and we&#39;ve gotten good enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">in general and cheaper is important you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">one area that i&#39;m quite involved in is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">science governance and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">facilitation of science and of course i</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">still do some scientific research myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">and scientific meetings virtually are</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">less expensive than</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">face-to-face in fact i just agreed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">fund three scientific meetings</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">and the costs are literally a tenth of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">what they would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">if this if these had been uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">face-to-face meetings so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">uh you know the ability to have more uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">scientific meetings is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">is actually uh very substantially</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.839" style="s2">upregulated by this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">uh systems dynamics uh change of going</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.839" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">to virtual</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">on the other hand there is some</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">downsides and you know i uh talk to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">people especially younger people who uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">miss the opportunity for doing the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:41.839" style="s2">networking and the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">the famous statement that ah the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.839" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">sessions aren&#39;t that important it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">conversations of coffee that really</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">so at least so far uh we haven&#39;t evolved</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">the virtual to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">to capture all the value of face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:55.920" style="s2">but we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">at a tenth the cost let&#39;s say and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.920" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">suspect because we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">adaptive and learning animals uh our</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">in the say in the next year you know if</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">medium is a good uh benchmark of how</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">uh there&#39;ll be a strong commitment to</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">however i am seeing improvement uh some</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">of the stuff originally was just</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">laughable but i&#39;d say it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.079" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">within striking distance uh and the one</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">i&#39;m the area i&#39;m most interested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">uh is vr conferencing that could</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">do it uh and i&#39;ve heard for instance</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">that the vr</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:38.560" style="s2">version of uh what&#39;s that damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">they do out in the desert burning man</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.560" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">uh is right apparently quite impressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard this from</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">multiple people i haven&#39;t had the uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">chance to or didn&#39;t get the chance to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">engage with it uh but uh you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">just the kind of cutting edge thing well</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">there&#39;ll be some cultural learning</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">and uh we might get we might get some</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">serendipity out the other side that will</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:00.160" style="s2">be uh be something very</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">interesting to watch over the next year</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.160" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">let&#39;s pivot now to the real estate</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">market i had not heard that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">facebook was buying up real estate that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t be doing it unless the prices</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">were really cheap but which they might</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">you know buying assets at distress is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">seldom a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">but before our call i did a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">research and uh the number that i found</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">is that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">value last year i.e before the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">of our all the office space in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">united states was 2.5</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">trillion dollars that&#39;s a damn big part</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">right right and if you assumed a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">possible contraction of maybe 50</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">in the value which doesn&#39;t strike me as</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">crazy because remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">uh in uh market capitalism everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">happens at the margin right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">uh marginal changes way less than fifty</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">percent can produce a fifty percent</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">decline in value yes you know think of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">the fact that the stock market</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">goes down 50 from time to time and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">that&#39;s probably only a 10</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">change in aggregate demand for stocks</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">anyway a 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">contraction in the office market asset</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">value would be a bigger shock to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">financial system</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">uh than the uh mortgage crisis of 20</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">2007</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">2008 and so and which triggered the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">great recession so</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s worth con thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">uh there&#39;s going to be some potential</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">financial follow-on if indeed there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">a long-term or even a short-term</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">diminishing in the value of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.360" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">uh office space as an asset class</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">yeah i i i totally agree that um</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:41.199" style="s2">so you&#39;re in a situation where um</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">uh already if um</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.199" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">companies are in distress um</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">and uh and not just companies because</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about the office</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">economy we&#39;re also talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">retail restaurants uh um</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">shop shops like shoe shine uh</p>

<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">of occupations that are reliant</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">uh on that office economy is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">very very long and and and the part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">it that&#39;s just the white-collar workers</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">is not the majority and uh and and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">uh it&#39;s uh it&#39;s um you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">talk about the office</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">if if they&#39;re in distress and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">pay their</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">mortgage then the then the guy</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">who owns that office building he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">to pay off the bank</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">you you have a potential uh gut punch</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">to commercial real estate and to banking</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">this is a uh is a it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">a a very uh worrying situation</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">economically and under appreciated the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">scale of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">exactly and in fact the trend over the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">last 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">20 years uh has been for most companies</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">to sell their office buildings and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:11.520" style="s2">lease them back right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">purchasers have been financial</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">actually know it&#39;s a good question i may</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">do a little bit of research on that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">uh let&#39;s move on to another related</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:48.240" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">i was talking to a economics professor</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.240" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">out at stanford</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">a couple weeks ago and he was confirming</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">what i had heard anecdotally</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">that there is a very sudden</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">uh very substantial exodus of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">from the big cities</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">uh you know san francisco new york uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">la for sure and probably a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:15.919" style="s2">and this could be an even greater uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">phase transition than the uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.919" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">retreat from</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">uh you know a class downtown office</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">buildings and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">uh silicon valley uh if people just move</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">out of the cities entirely and move back</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">to where maybe life is better and a hell</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">of a lot cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:33.440" style="s2">yeah this is now jim this can go both</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:36.960" style="s2">ways right so so yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">you do end up and we are seeing that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">that folks who who who could barely</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">afford to live</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.679" end="00:20:48.320" style="s2">in san francisco in new york um</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">are finding because of covid</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.320" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">that they can leave or they have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:54.480" style="s2">leave and you know they just</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">they aren&#39;t employed anymore and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.480" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">caused</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">rents to drop the last time i looked</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:01.919" style="s2">which was a month ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">new york rents had dropped by six</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.919" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">that&#39;s right it doesn&#39;t sound like much</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s a lot right for a place like</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">new york um and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">and and and so yes you do get this</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">exodus the but the other side of of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">is is and i i i hope that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">upstaging</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">a um a section you wanted to lead to and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">if so just tell me and we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">pause and then talk about it later but</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">you uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">you can end up you know you uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">the the uh the cost structure drops</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">one or two levels and then suddenly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">affordable</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">for a new class of people and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">rejuvenate these cities</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">at a at a a at a stepped</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">lower lower cost of living yep and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">certainly will happen that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">i mean that you know nothing is uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">linear everything is uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">non-linear systems with feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">let&#39;s say because rents have been going</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">down in new york for several years which</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">is interesting they&#39;ve been going down</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">five or six percent for several at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">high end especially the you know three</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">thousand dollar one bedrooms and what</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">have you they&#39;ve been uh coming down</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">for a while interestingly uh and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">six percent is probably only a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">faster than they were coming down but</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">you&#39;re right yeah certainly it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">be uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">then an opening up of opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">uh you know one of the things that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">new york in particular is</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:29.919" style="s2">horrendous for restaurant tours because</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">the rents are so damn high</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.919" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">uh you know if commercial real estate</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">rents fall on their ass it&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">open up a lot of opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">restaurants that couldn&#39;t have existed</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s never just one part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">effect there&#39;s always a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">on the other hand if we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">hysteresis and homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">uh you know people get lived in new york</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">or live in san francisco or silicon</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">valley l.a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">because they felt they had to i suspect</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">an awful lot of them to pursue their</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">careers</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">uh and again as just like business</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:04.400" style="s2">travel</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">it&#39;s actually been technically feasible</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.400" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2">to do a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">uh living in uh a much lower cost and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.960" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">probably better quality of life place</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">uh for quite a while at least 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">but the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">actually gave people the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">do it to try it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">and the bosses wouldn&#39;t hold it against</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">them and i think it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">arguable that people will find that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">you know living in a rural area or a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">small city</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">uh or even a medium-sized city uh you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">know like pittsburgh</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a very livable place very high</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">quality of life but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">you know cost of real estate&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2"> what is it maybe a fifth of what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">is in</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">new york or uh san francisco uh this</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">might be a permanent change it may well</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">that people particularly young people</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">who are the ones most beaten to ship</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">in the big cities uh because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">have the economic means you know four of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">them living in a one-bedroom</p>

<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">kovitt yep that&#39;s you know kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.559" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">slash and burn agriculture right you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">burn out the old and then something new</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">grows up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">and yeah and and and and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re i mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">sitting there and we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">mentioned it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">but but just to bring it back in the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">cities them</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">the cities themselves can be can</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">uh can become much more affordable and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">maybe not i i don&#39;t know maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">affordable for those folks</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">with a combined seventy thousand dollar</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">income but maybe a little bit more than</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">they can uh if they&#39;re young they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">move back they can move back to the city</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">yeah that would be interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">how it goes i mean i&#39;m not 100 sure the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">big city is a humane place to live i</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:08.720" style="s2">know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">like it uh but uh it strikes me as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.720" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">quite alien from uh you know those</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">things which we actually resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">uh you know beautiful nature uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">the ability to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">uh calm and quiet in one&#39;s life you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">safety for one&#39;s children</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">uh you know sense of knowing your</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">neighbors uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">real conviviality uh you know this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe an opportunity to escape that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">whole urbanization thing that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:38.960" style="s2">worldwide and that might</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">if that were to be the case uh that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.960" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">would be the biggest outcome</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:44.880" style="s2">uh from this shock yeah well okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">so you rate uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.880" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">so you raise um two things one</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">is the uh the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">forecast of uh of of of the big</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">uh uh white shoe think tanks</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">like uh like the boston consulting group</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">and mckinsey and all</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">you know uh uh bain that were</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">inexorably urbanizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">um this this this could</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">reverse that right yep that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">uh and it uh probably doesn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">right away but it may produce enough of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">the you know the two percent innovators</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">to show the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">uh you know people are rightfully uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">skeptical about new ideas uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:34.559" style="s2">particularly about how</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">how and where to live but you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.559" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">say two percent of people actually do</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">make the move over the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">ten years uh two percent six million</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">people that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">right and if we have you know thousands</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">of small communities</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">on the order of a few hundred people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">are actually showing how</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">a really ultra wonderful way of life can</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">be had</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">at a quite reasonable uh level of income</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">uh that could then attract the next part</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">the so-called early adopters and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">know the next you know that when gen</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">z comes up and becomes ready to go out</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">into the workforce</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">uh maybe 15 percent of them uh move to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">uh non-urban high quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">and then over another couple generations</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">it becomes the norm and the city&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">become depopulated of course this has</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">happened before i like to point out that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">rome at its peak had a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">population of i don&#39;t know a million and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">a half something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">uh by 800 a.d the population of rome</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">what was it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">15 000. oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">15 000. uh so we have seen the decline</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">of cities in the past</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">and who knows maybe this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">beginning of it you know it won&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">overnight</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be the work of generations</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">but truthfully my view</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">is that we&#39;d be happier uh not living in</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:51.919" style="s2">these giant urban</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">uh monsters that kind of squeeze the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.919" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">humanity out</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">when i think of new york and i go to new</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">york used to go to new york fairly</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">regularly</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">the thing always strikes me in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">is sort of unhuman</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">is when you&#39;re riding the subway</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">everyone&#39;s looking down at their shoes</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">and not interacting with each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">and intentionally shutting each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">off it&#39;s just like a weird</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:16.159" style="s2">weird weird way to live yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">but but uh the uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.159" end="00:34:19.599" style="s2">yes this is so and and that rome example</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">dramatic urbanists</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">uh argue for your homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">thesis on cities though they say cities</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">have forever been forecast for death</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">uh but they bounced back and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">uh and rome did eventually bounce back i</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">don&#39;t know what what</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">what year did it come back to um to its</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">prior</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">uh level i guess it must have taken</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">yeah i gotta graph somewhere with that</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">on it one of the presentations that i do</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">accessible at my fingertips and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">right you know the two of the scholars</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">associated with our santa fe institute</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">uh jeffrey west and louise bettencourt</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">have done a lot of work on cities</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">and they point out that cities last way</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">longer than</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">companies or even countries right uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">you know damascus syria has been around</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">for some like</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">7 000 years through uh you know one</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">empire after the other one</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">conqueror after the other and damascus</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">is still there</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about the form of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">cities uh which</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">are very good for longevity but from</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">time to time they do disappear</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">and you know again uh the other thing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.200" end="00:35:34.960" style="s2">keep in mind is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">we talked about the very beginning is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.960" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">that the network</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">substrate may change everything uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">prior to inexpensive high quality uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">ability to interact via the network</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">there really wasn&#39;t a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">alternative to the cities for</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">certain kinds of human collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">that may</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">no longer be true yeah that is right</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">painful for an awful lot of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">and we also need to you know consider</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">the fact there could be some very</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">adverse</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">uh political social uh impacts from the</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">negative shock uh you know and i look</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">back ominously at you know 1922-19</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">in germany right where the middle class</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">was first decimated by hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">which wiped out most of their savings</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">and then the great depression</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">a lot of people lost their jobs and as</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">you said they just knocked out of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">middle class or even out of the upper</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">working class</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">and when such things occur people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">willing to try</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">what in retrospect we can see is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">crazy ass</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2"> and you know we&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">it you know both the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">uh in the united states are you know out</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">in the streets killing each other at low</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">numbers so far</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">but that could accelerate at any time so</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">uh i suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:17.359" style="s2">uh you know this more extreme uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">absolutist politics that we&#39;re seeing on</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.359" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">both flanks</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">may actually be accelerated by uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">you know the people who are being</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">knocked out of the uh the middle class</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">or even the upper working class</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">yeah i love this uh this formulation</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">the uh the sort of standard that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">established</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">for uh for the uh the possibility of</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">where we could go um on the extremes</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">and it would be called uh the uh crazy</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">ass</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">uh uh metric yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">exactly one uh one to ten or one to 100</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">where are you on this scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">well it&#39;s one there&#39;s a group of us that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">meet weekly to discuss this</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">and uh and some of the top i won&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">their names</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">some names you would know uh and our</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">current thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">is that you know we&#39;re about a 10 out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">100 but</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">we&#39;re at could well be close to a cusp</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.800" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">where it goes to 80 out of 100 which</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">basically means</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">uh civil war or uh or</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:23.040" style="s2">an authoritarian crackdown and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">probably only a</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">one wrong event</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">away from a phase change from 10 out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">crazy to 70 or 80 out of 100 crazy</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">uh and the fact that uh people on both</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">sides are so</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">amped up so living in bubble chambers</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">uh they interpret the world through a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">lens of radical ideology</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">uh and where any you know a random</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">uh could be amplified uh and produce</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">this phase change as i think what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re really concerned about uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">and you know the coming election could</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">provide that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">uh you know uh a single or very small</p>

<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a uh it it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.319" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">such a volatile uh time</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">and uh i mean we i guess we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">gone off the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we&#39;ve kind of diverged but</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">it but</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">if if people were employed i mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not disconnected if people were</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.960" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">employed</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">um and there weren&#39;t covered</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">uh you know maybe we wouldn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t have a lot of this stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">in the streets right now yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">exactly my point which is that as people</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">having reason to have alliance with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">status quo</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">i.e they have a decent job uh they can</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:50.480" style="s2">pay their rent etc</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">then this kind of stuff uh gets you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s happened before and peter&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">over time but it&#39;s a degree people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">kicked out of the middle class and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">don&#39;t really see an alternative then</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">the extremes of the right and the left</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">uh start to make sense right</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">yeah and that i think that was really my</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">point yes uh so so i think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">hopefully hopefully we can de-escalate</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">from this craziness</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">uh but we may not be able to uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">and you probably all of us individually</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">should try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">uh not get sucked into the vortex of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">left or the extreme all right now i call</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">them by the way i have a new name for</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">them the infrareds and the ultraviolets</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">and we have the red and the blue and if</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">you go on the spectrum beyond red and</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">try not to get sucked into the vortex so</p>
