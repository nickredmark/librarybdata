<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:11.879" style="s2">this 9 minute clip of Zach Stein on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">future fossils podcast which I&#39;m sharing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.879" end="00:02:14.700" style="s2">with Michael&#39;s permission of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">now I was going to go today is I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.700" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">start with the audio clip and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:22.020" style="s2">Darrell David and I are going to check</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:23.220" style="s2">in and do what&#39;s called topical circling</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.020" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">which basically means we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.220" end="00:02:28.200" style="s2">share ideas and impact and riff off each</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">other as it were and for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.200" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">unfamiliar with the idea of a topical</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">circle circle it is simply a circle in</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:35.400" style="s2">which we allow more latitude for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:37.950" style="s2">sharing of intellectual content and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.400" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">ideas than we do in a regular or strict</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.950" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">relational meditation circle while still</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2">holding connection intent as primary as</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">we do in regular circle meaning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.540" end="00:02:49.459" style="s2">sharing ideas but also you know impact</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:53.850" style="s2">and hopefully valuing our connection</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.459" end="00:02:56.910" style="s2">through this process so let me kick it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.850" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">off with Zach Stein he&#39;s describing an</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.910" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">emergent philosophy called meta</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:03.780" style="s2">modernism which is both a philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">a movement which we believe has</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.780" end="00:03:08.450" style="s2">significant implications on the practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">of circling and what we kind of do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.450" end="00:03:14.880" style="s2">we live in a time between worlds and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">time in which the deepest questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.880" end="00:03:19.049" style="s2">about what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">are kind of on the table again it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.049" end="00:03:22.519" style="s2">there are neurosciences seriously</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:26.070" style="s2">suggesting we don&#39;t have free will and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.519" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">arguing we can like change the legal</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.070" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">system which is predicated upon free</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:32.160" style="s2">will by the way like we can change the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:33.600" style="s2">legal system we can change the legal</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.160" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">assistant to say that there is not free</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.600" end="00:03:38.700" style="s2">well like serious suggestions and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:41.060" style="s2">of course does God exists is there an</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.700" end="00:03:43.590" style="s2">afterlife is there reincarnation</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.060" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">the nature of illness a nature healing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.590" end="00:03:50.850" style="s2">all of these things are scattered in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:54.690" style="s2">this kind of post truth cultural desert</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.850" end="00:03:56.760" style="s2">where you&#39;re not sure which ones you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.690" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">know if a thriving Oasis and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.760" end="00:04:04.140" style="s2">uh you know basically a mirage and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:06.450" style="s2">part of that student to the Internet and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.140" end="00:04:08.459" style="s2">I talked about the kind of structural</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.450" end="00:04:09.870" style="s2">way that the post truth culture has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.459" end="00:04:12.660" style="s2">generated by the very logic of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.870" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">communication technology but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.660" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">moment properly speaking in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:19.100" style="s2">evolution of culture which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.709" end="00:04:22.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a rightful overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.100" end="00:04:27.410" style="s2">the singular logic and logo centrism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.970" end="00:04:30.050" style="s2">mono centrosome of modernity and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.410" end="00:04:31.970" style="s2">postmodern proliferation of perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.050" end="00:04:35.240" style="s2">and the and they can comment and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.970" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">confusion is is par for the course but</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.240" end="00:04:40.010" style="s2">it&#39;s of course a dangerous critical</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:42.650" style="s2">global path now through the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.010" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">back to reality and so I talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.650" end="00:04:48.110" style="s2">return to eros and a return to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:51.470" style="s2">metaphysics in which not just physical</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.110" end="00:04:53.300" style="s2">things are real but also the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.470" end="00:04:55.760" style="s2">populate the human interiors and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.300" end="00:04:58.280" style="s2">especially the constellation of emotions</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.760" end="00:05:02.060" style="s2">around love that these things are as</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.280" end="00:05:04.190" style="s2">real as any of the physical properties</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.060" end="00:05:06.440" style="s2">and so this gets to again the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.190" end="00:05:08.810" style="s2">reality and the need to have it more</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.440" end="00:05:11.330" style="s2">nuance to metaphysics that doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:13.580" style="s2">materiality and meaningless matter in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.330" end="00:05:18.650" style="s2">motion and Darwinian dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.580" end="00:05:19.730" style="s2">includes meaning value the interior T&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.650" end="00:05:22.910" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.730" end="00:05:24.710" style="s2">etc right totally so yeah absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.910" end="00:05:28.210" style="s2">mean the framing of the papers in terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.710" end="00:05:31.490" style="s2">of the cultural epic or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.210" end="00:05:34.280" style="s2">historical period designation right</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.490" end="00:05:35.900" style="s2">versus saying slice history and and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.280" end="00:05:38.330" style="s2">know the history is a very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:43.970" style="s2">stream you can slice it into periods or</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.330" end="00:05:46.130" style="s2">a box and so there&#39;s a group that is you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.970" end="00:05:47.000" style="s2">know mostly in kind of Europe and there</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.130" end="00:05:49.730" style="s2">are there&#39;s some American</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.000" end="00:05:53.330" style="s2">representatives who have kind of dubbed</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.730" end="00:05:58.820" style="s2">the emerging period of history that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.330" end="00:06:01.610" style="s2">are entering as meta modern and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.820" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s an important conversation because I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.610" end="00:06:05.810" style="s2">was convinced long ago by Habermas and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:08.060" style="s2">others that what we call post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.810" end="00:06:09.710" style="s2">is actually most of the traits of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.060" end="00:06:11.930" style="s2">modernity just with the volume turned</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.710" end="00:06:14.200" style="s2">really way up like his subjects you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.930" end="00:06:16.850" style="s2">subjectivity increases you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.200" end="00:06:18.910" style="s2">contextualization and increases instead</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.850" end="00:06:22.070" style="s2">of one perspective you get many</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.910" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">perspectives not the pre perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.070" end="00:06:26.690" style="s2">pre-modern where the individual in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:29.449" style="s2">group refused but this hyper</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.690" end="00:06:32.599" style="s2">individualism flourishes more under</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.449" end="00:06:35.629" style="s2">Smothers so this idea that there must be</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.599" end="00:06:37.430" style="s2">an a cultural turning in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.629" end="00:06:39.710" style="s2">critique both the postmodern and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.430" end="00:06:40.939" style="s2">modern and we can value both the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.710" end="00:06:42.379" style="s2">postmodern and the modern</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.939" end="00:06:45.770" style="s2">which is to say there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.379" end="00:06:48.830" style="s2">distinctly non modern or meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.770" end="00:06:49.969" style="s2">which will get a name later we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.830" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">sure what it will be that&#39;s the way I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.969" end="00:06:55.370" style="s2">hold it then an integral theory which I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">discovered a very young like in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.370" end="00:06:59.300" style="s2">twenties like I was twenty literally</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:02.810" style="s2">when I read in sex culture spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.300" end="00:07:05.330" style="s2">um you know this was I see this now is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.810" end="00:07:08.389" style="s2">species of meta modern philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.330" end="00:07:10.279" style="s2">there were many varieties of meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.389" end="00:07:12.770" style="s2">philosophy not all of them are integrals</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.279" end="00:07:17.469" style="s2">here intro theory is one that I started</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.770" end="00:07:20.930" style="s2">with and like a lot but there are other</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.469" end="00:07:25.430" style="s2">candidates meta modern you know meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.930" end="00:07:28.249" style="s2">modern world views and so we know one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.430" end="00:07:31.490" style="s2">the things that makes a cultural period</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.249" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">a period is that there&#39;s some coherence</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.490" end="00:07:34.550" style="s2">to the structure of it and so this list</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:37.069" style="s2">you talk about in the beginning of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.550" end="00:07:39.949" style="s2">paper it&#39;s it&#39;s a list of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.069" end="00:07:42.379" style="s2">that kind of characterized the meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.949" end="00:07:44.389" style="s2">modern historical periods view of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.379" end="00:07:45.620" style="s2">reality in science and it&#39;s distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.389" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">different from the postmodern in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.620" end="00:07:50.199" style="s2">modern right so the the modern view of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:53.389" style="s2">science is that science is truth period</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.199" end="00:07:54.680" style="s2">like in the periods very definite the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.389" end="00:07:58.849" style="s2">postmodern view of science is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:08:00.770" style="s2">science is one view dot dot dot right</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.849" end="00:08:03.259" style="s2">like there&#39;s actually many and Sciences</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.770" end="00:08:04.819" style="s2">one the meta monter view essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.259" end="00:08:07.249" style="s2">tries to say that both of those are true</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.819" end="00:08:09.740" style="s2">and as you were saying within specific</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.249" end="00:08:11.930" style="s2">context science works it actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.740" end="00:08:13.999" style="s2">discovers things the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.930" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s overstepped its context and so it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.999" end="00:08:17.810" style="s2">takes for example of an experiment that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.939" style="s2">was done in a very closed condition in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.810" end="00:08:21.979" style="s2">laboratory and pretends that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.939" end="00:08:23.270" style="s2">discovered there applies to radically</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.979" end="00:08:25.459" style="s2">open systems outside the laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.270" end="00:08:27.620" style="s2">right you get pharmaceuticals in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.459" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">drinking water because we&#39;re acai Slee</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.620" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">push this thing through</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:32.659" style="s2">no that&#39;s and that&#39;s perfect example you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:35.269" style="s2">know and that&#39;s exactly the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.659" end="00:08:37.190" style="s2">the modern view which is correct in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.269" end="00:08:38.990" style="s2">laboratory guys like don&#39;t take em this</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.190" end="00:08:41.659" style="s2">other postmodern seize that moment of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.990" end="00:08:42.350" style="s2">error in the modern and then once the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.659" end="00:08:44.900" style="s2">thorough science</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.350" end="00:08:46.220" style="s2">the window completely the meta modernist</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.900" end="00:08:49.160" style="s2">says hold on something happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.220" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">laboratory like we we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.160" end="00:08:53.750" style="s2">pay attention to the moment of truth in</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:56.360" style="s2">the modern and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.750" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">contextualize it with the postmodern you</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.360" end="00:09:01.700" style="s2">know alternative which says well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:02.540" style="s2">do a bunch of other experiments let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.700" end="00:09:05.180" style="s2">things that don&#39;t even look like</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.540" end="00:09:07.310" style="s2">experiments right and let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.180" end="00:09:08.860" style="s2">methodologies that are non quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.310" end="00:09:10.520" style="s2">and methodologies that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.860" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">phenomenological and purely subjective</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.520" end="00:09:15.590" style="s2">which a modernist would never even touch</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:17.450" style="s2">so you get this proliferation of methods</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.590" end="00:09:19.700" style="s2">proliferation of perspectives all good</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.450" end="00:09:23.270" style="s2">but now how a total fragmentation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.700" end="00:09:25.550" style="s2">like out of the Academy comes totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.270" end="00:09:28.670" style="s2">confusing gobbledygook about what is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.550" end="00:09:30.710" style="s2">nature of the human well you know I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.670" end="00:09:32.120" style="s2">think it was internet recording at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.710" end="00:09:34.280" style="s2">a half a dozen time and every time it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:36.740" style="s2">kind of moves me and excites me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.280" end="00:09:39.110" style="s2">nothing where it&#39;s very powerful yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.740" end="00:09:42.140" style="s2">so David want you I kick us off with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.110" end="00:09:43.160" style="s2">your impact on that and if anything else</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s up for you by the way we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.160" end="00:09:47.560" style="s2">limiting this conversation in any way</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.280" end="00:09:50.420" style="s2">yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.560" end="00:09:52.490" style="s2">you know I first just want to say you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.420" end="00:09:53.930" style="s2">know thank you guys I&#39;ve been listening</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.490" end="00:09:56.360" style="s2">to Michael Garfield for a while but this</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.930" end="00:09:58.070" style="s2">this conversation I&#39;m excited that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.360" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">that it stirred up more people as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.070" end="00:10:05.420" style="s2">and it really does it there&#39;s a vibrancy</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.740" end="00:10:06.350" style="s2">that zach Stein brings to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.420" end="00:10:07.610" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.350" end="00:10:10.610" style="s2">that I think has been missing up till</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.610" end="00:10:12.590" style="s2">now you know I like both of you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.610" end="00:10:13.880" style="s2">been studying will prefer a while and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.590" end="00:10:16.610" style="s2">actually participated in some of his</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.880" end="00:10:18.650" style="s2">courses back in 2005 and I&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.610" end="00:10:23.210" style="s2">sense that I that there is some way to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.650" end="00:10:24.680" style="s2">bring all of this to a more ideal way</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.210" end="00:10:27.380" style="s2">that we can relate to each other I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.680" end="00:10:33.470" style="s2">my whole my whole thing of wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.380" end="00:10:35.390" style="s2">have a well I&#39;ll say I was impacted as</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.470" end="00:10:37.610" style="s2">well by Buckminster Fuller and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.390" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">sense that we want to we want a world</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.610" end="00:10:42.020" style="s2">that works for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:43.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s a way that that has always</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.020" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">felt a little bit theoretical and too</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.400" end="00:10:48.950" style="s2">far off and there&#39;s a frustration around</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">that and and even with participating</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.950" end="00:10:52.250" style="s2">with Wilbur and everything else there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:55.670" style="s2">just this way in which it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.250" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s we can&#39;t seem to get the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.670" end="00:11:01.970" style="s2">grounded route of how do we get started</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:06.590" style="s2">on that listen as it heads on sticks yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.970" end="00:11:10.550" style="s2">yes yes yes and so my experience was</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.590" end="00:11:12.830" style="s2">circling was a way for me my</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.550" end="00:11:14.750" style="s2">introduction to it came at an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.830" end="00:11:16.370" style="s2">of saying I think there&#39;s something my</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.750" end="00:11:18.170" style="s2">body has to contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.370" end="00:11:21.470" style="s2">conversation that I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.170" end="00:11:23.390" style="s2">hear and actually slowing down enough to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.470" end="00:11:26.330" style="s2">listen to myself while I was relating to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.390" end="00:11:28.280" style="s2">others profoundly shifted the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.330" end="00:11:29.840" style="s2">listen and it&#39;s in after three years of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.280" end="00:11:32.660" style="s2">practice I find that I&#39;m continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.840" end="00:11:35.630" style="s2">deepen in that and so it&#39;s really this</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.660" end="00:11:38.090" style="s2">powerful way that I can see connecting</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.630" end="00:11:41.780" style="s2">to others really acquires a deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.090" end="00:11:44.170" style="s2">connecting to myself first what was</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.780" end="00:11:47.540" style="s2">powerful in listening to Zack Stein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.170" end="00:11:51.410" style="s2">interview with with Michael Garfield was</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.540" end="00:11:54.760" style="s2">the recognition that we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.410" end="00:11:57.050" style="s2">now that we feel like suddenly we have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.760" end="00:12:00.710" style="s2">collective way of doing that like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.050" end="00:12:02.660" style="s2">need to get to a point of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.710" end="00:12:08.810" style="s2">hear what it is that we as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.660" end="00:12:14.060" style="s2">what we as a species want is a deep way</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.810" end="00:12:15.740" style="s2">of its it&#39;s like in this moment I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.060" end="00:12:19.490" style="s2">it makes so much sense that we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.740" end="00:12:21.650" style="s2">post truth era and I&#39;m from where we</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.490" end="00:12:23.660" style="s2">have been so far it&#39;s like if we could</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.650" end="00:12:26.120" style="s2">just establish the ground rules for how</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.660" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">to interact with one another then we get</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.120" end="00:12:30.680" style="s2">going and it&#39;s like we&#39;re finally at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2">point I feel like we&#39;re finally at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.680" end="00:12:38.300" style="s2">point where that&#39;s no longer that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:40.550" style="s2">longer the the goal we&#39;re giving up on</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.300" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">the notion of what are the essential</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.550" end="00:12:45.830" style="s2">ground rules to get started all we need</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">to do is start with where we&#39;re at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.830" end="00:12:51.350" style="s2">we need to do is start with right here</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:54.920" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where I&#39;m super excited to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.350" end="00:12:58.310" style="s2">see what arises when we actually just</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.920" end="00:13:00.080" style="s2">meet each other meet myself look in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.310" end="00:13:02.770" style="s2">mirror very clearly and say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.080" end="00:13:02.770" style="s2">here&#39;s where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.770" end="00:13:08.300" style="s2">thank you David that&#39;s beautiful what</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.990" end="00:13:11.990" style="s2">I&#39;m what I&#39;m resonating with is slow</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.300" end="00:13:14.870" style="s2">down long enough to notice what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.990" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">on within you and that&#39;s all we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.870" end="00:13:21.320" style="s2">do so let&#39;s just let&#39;s just put that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:28.820" style="s2">into the space and let it simmer for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.320" end="00:13:32.600" style="s2">bit okay thank you yes cool what are</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.820" end="00:13:34.460" style="s2">your thoughts now yeah so great great</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">stuff there David particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.460" end="00:13:38.810" style="s2">embodiment part in listening to our</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:42.410" style="s2">bodies and not knowing how to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.810" end="00:13:45.050" style="s2">what our bodies are saying I recently</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.410" end="00:13:49.160" style="s2">you have have ongoing also had a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.050" end="00:13:51.500" style="s2">frustration with language and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.160" end="00:13:54.170" style="s2">this idea that language has so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.500" end="00:13:55.610" style="s2">power but I think a lot of people give</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.170" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">it too much credence and then some other</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.610" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">people too encoded enough credence and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:00.800" style="s2">was very interested to hear about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:05.270" style="s2">book you mentioned something about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:07.840" style="s2">alphabet and and the body David yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.270" end="00:14:14.450" style="s2">alphabet versus the goddess bye laughs</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.840" end="00:14:18.260" style="s2">great def a my reading list now and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.450" end="00:14:22.670" style="s2">I want to contrast the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.260" end="00:14:25.970" style="s2">aspects of Bucky and and Wilbur with</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.670" end="00:14:28.130" style="s2">with also wanting to get embodied what</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.970" end="00:14:30.110" style="s2">is the embodied mr. filler look like for</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.130" end="00:14:32.870" style="s2">us how can can we&#39;ll bring it more</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.110" end="00:14:35.300" style="s2">embodied and maybe that&#39;s what Zack is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.870" end="00:14:37.910" style="s2">kind of able to reach here in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.300" end="00:14:41.780" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly what I&#39;m wanting no</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.910" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">matter what we do but I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.780" end="00:14:47.990" style="s2">lot to be said for kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:51.770" style="s2">about haha like that just that question</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.990" end="00:14:54.230" style="s2">how does anybody in a given interaction</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.770" end="00:14:57.800" style="s2">get what they want and how are we</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.230" end="00:14:59.570" style="s2">creating more than win-win-win for you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.800" end="00:15:04.030" style="s2">one for me and one for the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.570" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">world in nature interactions and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.030" end="00:15:11.030" style="s2">but that&#39;s really complex and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:16.370" style="s2">enable we&#39;re gonna do a place where</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.030" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">we&#39;re able to have technology and spirit</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.370" end="00:15:25.720" style="s2">and human connection and awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:25.720" style="s2">our bodies enough that it&#39;s possible and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.840" end="00:15:31.850" style="s2">this is maybe what zach is saying when</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.279" end="00:15:35.180" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about kind of this new new</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.850" end="00:15:38.150" style="s2">return to metaphysics there&#39;s some some</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.180" end="00:15:42.740" style="s2">new like I get deeper in his podcast if</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.150" end="00:15:45.410" style="s2">he says something about or we mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.740" end="00:15:47.300" style="s2">this that there&#39;s this in post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.410" end="00:15:48.830" style="s2">everything&#39;s okay or everything is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.300" end="00:15:51.740" style="s2">it is people are just who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.830" end="00:15:54.170" style="s2">they are and we still have that yet</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.740" end="00:15:58.670" style="s2">there is some unifying sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.170" end="00:16:01.339" style="s2">human or of Venus and while ago I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.670" end="00:16:03.050" style="s2">wondering you know what would the human</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.339" end="00:16:04.910" style="s2">mission statement be or what would the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.050" end="00:16:07.850" style="s2">Earth&#39;s mission Satan beginning to like</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.910" end="00:16:12.680" style="s2">a Gaia hypothesis sort of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.850" end="00:16:13.850" style="s2">what if everybody knew what that was or</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.680" end="00:16:15.980" style="s2">was able to interact with it at some</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.850" end="00:16:20.230" style="s2">level in each of the decisions that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.980" end="00:16:20.230" style="s2">make day to day to to co-create</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.260" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">consciousness if you dare though that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.550" end="00:16:32.180" style="s2">was very inspiring for me as well as</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:36.680" style="s2">sort of this idea of a triple win me me</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.180" end="00:16:38.120" style="s2">you in the world I don&#39;t that so so</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.680" end="00:16:41.150" style="s2">here&#39;s what I want to say so</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.120" end="00:16:44.660" style="s2">listening to Zach Stein me me feel less</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.150" end="00:16:46.220" style="s2">alone in that I can see now that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.660" end="00:16:48.830" style="s2">part of this movement which he calls</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.220" end="00:16:51.320" style="s2">meta modernism and which I liken</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.830" end="00:16:54.080" style="s2">essentially to the planetary merchants</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.320" end="00:16:55.820" style="s2">of integral to your consciousness as an</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.080" end="00:17:00.980" style="s2">integral theory including transcend of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.820" end="00:17:03.290" style="s2">left and right politics right and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:04.670" style="s2">is a worldview that I feel has quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.290" end="00:17:07.160" style="s2">profound implications to the theory and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.670" end="00:17:08.780" style="s2">practice of circling so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.160" end="00:17:13.310" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk about this is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.780" end="00:17:15.050" style="s2">circling podcast so I&#39;m developing two</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.310" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">platforms just very briefly one is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.050" end="00:17:18.199" style="s2">circling guide in which I&#39;m basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:20.270" style="s2">trying to educate and inspire people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.199" end="00:17:22.250" style="s2">learn about and practice circling and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.270" end="00:17:24.050" style="s2">not just in formal circles but also with</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.250" end="00:17:25.610" style="s2">their loved ones and business partner is</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.050" end="00:17:28.670" style="s2">a practice that I have called in my book</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.610" end="00:17:29.900" style="s2">guerrilla circling as in guerrilla</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.670" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">warfare of the underground</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.900" end="00:17:34.370" style="s2">the Louisville Revolutionary Army haha</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:35.930" style="s2">and I was giving the thumbs up here and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.370" end="00:17:37.850" style="s2">my other platform is the man-woman</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.930" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">education platform and I could say a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.850" end="00:17:41.090" style="s2">more about history was circling in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:43.180" style="s2">ongoing love affair with the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.090" end="00:17:45.770" style="s2">circling and with a circling community</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.180" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">but let&#39;s um let&#39;s get back to Metta</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.770" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">modernist philosophy here and its</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:54.290" style="s2">implications so from my perspective it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.390" style="s2">and in that time really helped me to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.290" end="00:17:59.150" style="s2">this is circling to me is a very precise</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.390" end="00:18:01.940" style="s2">and very powerful application only the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.150" end="00:18:03.560" style="s2">instantiation of this meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:05.990" style="s2">philosophy into the field of human</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.560" end="00:18:07.070" style="s2">loving of the fundamental challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.990" end="00:18:10.280" style="s2">learning how to love and be loved</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.070" end="00:18:11.990" style="s2">including all the obstacles that are put</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.280" end="00:18:13.610" style="s2">in our way which of course include</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.990" end="00:18:16.310" style="s2">developmental trauma and/or social</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.610" end="00:18:20.660" style="s2">conditioning and what I am really trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.310" end="00:18:22.250" style="s2">to do in my life is to bring this</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.660" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">question of love back into the public</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.250" end="00:18:26.510" style="s2">conversation but in a practical way</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:29.060" style="s2">which i think zach is doing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.510" end="00:18:31.970" style="s2">really what has me so excited I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.060" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s very intellectual but it&#39;s also it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.970" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">really resonates with me in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:38.720" style="s2">fundamental ways um and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.340" end="00:18:40.280" style="s2">what I&#39;m so excited about circly because</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.720" end="00:18:42.530" style="s2">I believe that certainly is perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.280" end="00:18:44.210" style="s2">fastest and most direct way of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.530" end="00:18:46.130" style="s2">a more loving person or learning those</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.210" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">skills and becoming a more whole and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.130" end="00:18:51.230" style="s2">more complex and more generous more</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:53.570" style="s2">injury-related and happier person and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.230" end="00:18:55.490" style="s2">think you guys thanks Darrell and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.570" end="00:18:57.020" style="s2">think you guys know I&#39;m a circle</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.490" end="00:19:01.490" style="s2">chuckling groupie and you guys are not</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.020" end="00:19:04.820" style="s2">very far behind particularly David yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.490" end="00:19:06.770" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just give one frame here and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.820" end="00:19:09.260" style="s2">then all I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll move to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.770" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">topic of circle the frame which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.260" end="00:19:13.490" style="s2">meaningful to me in which illustrates</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.610" end="00:19:16.820" style="s2">the nature of circling as a integral or</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.490" end="00:19:18.530" style="s2">meta modern practice and so I will mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.820" end="00:19:19.940" style="s2">one of the core principles of circling</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.530" end="00:19:23.270" style="s2">which is welcome everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.940" end="00:19:25.070" style="s2">welcome everything right um but for me</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.270" end="00:19:27.110" style="s2">for this to work it needs to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.070" end="00:19:28.580" style="s2">active woken up welcomed everything so</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.110" end="00:19:31.250" style="s2">it needs to be done within a relational</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.580" end="00:19:34.370" style="s2">container in which we truly attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.250" end="00:19:35.570" style="s2">understand in connects and connect with</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.370" end="00:19:36.860" style="s2">what the other is bringing so this would</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.570" end="00:19:39.950" style="s2">be in contrast for instance to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.860" end="00:19:42.260" style="s2">postmodern approach such as Fritz Perls</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.950" end="00:19:43.640" style="s2">famous quote you do your thing and I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.260" end="00:19:45.910" style="s2">mine and if we meet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.640" end="00:19:48.860" style="s2">beautiful and if we don&#39;t do bad right</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.910" end="00:19:50.300" style="s2">so it sounds good but somehow to me that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.860" end="00:19:52.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t satisfy because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.300" end="00:19:54.650" style="s2">actually speak our demon need to connect</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.850" end="00:19:56.210" style="s2">and to relate to each other through our</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.650" end="00:19:57.680" style="s2">differences and to find common ground in</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.210" end="00:20:00.520" style="s2">our shared humanity which is really what</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.680" end="00:20:03.500" style="s2">it uses which is really where the joy is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.520" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">so I think let me just put that into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.500" end="00:20:10.520" style="s2">space and see what we want to go from</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.800" end="00:21:43.850" style="s2">shame around sexuality I had no idea how</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.000" end="00:21:46.700" style="s2">central that was to the difficulty I</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.719" end="00:22:24.709" style="s2">that moved me the most about it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.529" end="00:22:26.929" style="s2">opening myself up giving having been</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.709" end="00:22:30.079" style="s2">given the opportunity to speak first had</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.929" end="00:22:33.079" style="s2">to be to really delve into my experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.079" end="00:22:35.269" style="s2">of my sexuality with other men opened me</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.079" end="00:22:38.029" style="s2">up in some profound ways my heart space</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.269" end="00:22:40.249" style="s2">just expanded and from that place</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.029" end="00:22:44.119" style="s2">actually moving into witnessing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.249" end="00:22:46.999" style="s2">women I just noticed how powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.119" end="00:22:49.519" style="s2">distinct the experiences or that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.999" end="00:22:52.519" style="s2">listening and I was able to hear myself</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.519" end="00:22:55.429" style="s2">the here new subtle nuances of ways in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.519" end="00:23:00.919" style="s2">which I wanted to listen to myself in it</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.429" end="00:23:05.449" style="s2">it&#39;s a thing that&#39;s really powerful is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.919" end="00:23:07.849" style="s2">just how much that I crave that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.449" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">it&#39;s satisfied some deep yearning inside</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.849" end="00:23:11.659" style="s2">of me that&#39;ll let that just brought</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:14.589" style="s2">tears to my eyes it just allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.659" end="00:23:18.949" style="s2">actually hear what it was that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.589" end="00:23:21.229" style="s2">from connection and then it&#39;s it brought</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.949" end="00:23:22.519" style="s2">tears to my when you to my eyes even</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.229" end="00:23:24.949" style="s2">when you first spoke about this and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.519" end="00:23:26.989" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing is some the women speaking</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.949" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">you know it&#39;s coming to me now actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.989" end="00:23:35.389" style="s2">the grief is that the women speaking</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:39.859" style="s2">reflected something inside you then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.389" end="00:23:45.319" style="s2">found a listening form yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.859" end="00:23:49.609" style="s2">yeah absolutely yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.319" end="00:23:53.449" style="s2">beautiful yeah it&#39;s the I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.609" end="00:23:57.499" style="s2">it captures it but the sense is if if</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.449" end="00:24:00.529" style="s2">you if you will but listen to me we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.499" end="00:24:02.569" style="s2">really dance right which is what they</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.529" end="00:24:05.820" style="s2">want right right that that&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.569" end="00:24:09.610" style="s2">right yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.820" end="00:24:11.560" style="s2">and the challenge there is us opening to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.610" end="00:24:13.150" style="s2">that request and then making the request</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.560" end="00:24:18.870" style="s2">and then making the request and wait</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.150" end="00:24:22.120" style="s2">it&#39;s actually enrolling right right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.870" end="00:24:25.270" style="s2">they&#39;re my own personal practice has</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.120" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">been I&#39;m actually hearing parts of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.270" end="00:24:31.950" style="s2">myself make the same request</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:35.290" style="s2">you know I am I&#39;m aware that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.950" end="00:24:38.590" style="s2">attempting to solve this problem from an</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.290" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">intellectual space it&#39;s circling has</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.590" end="00:24:42.790" style="s2">given me an a capacity for listening</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:44.710" style="s2">deeper than that and now that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.790" end="00:24:47.380" style="s2">what I would I the way that I frame it</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.710" end="00:24:49.090" style="s2">is I am actually looking for authentic</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.380" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">partnership between my heart and my</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.090" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">brain yeah yeah yeah do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.830" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">thoughts on that Darryl or any impact at</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:15.280" style="s2">the moment I think a lot most of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:16.870" style="s2">life&#39;s mission humans is to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.280" end="00:25:21.790" style="s2">the connections between each of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.870" end="00:25:24.820" style="s2">chakras pretty nebulous easy wasters I</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.790" end="00:25:26.290" style="s2">know I get it but where do we where is</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.820" end="00:25:28.300" style="s2">the next step in that or how are we able</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.290" end="00:25:31.870" style="s2">to better know I have this fantasy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.300" end="00:25:34.270" style="s2">little chakra watch that tells us how</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.870" end="00:25:36.940" style="s2">we&#39;re doing nice glowing stuff maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.270" end="00:25:41.190" style="s2">someday we have better awarenesses of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.940" end="00:25:47.590" style="s2">that that can be measured and shown and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.190" end="00:25:54.390" style="s2">coached as we until we do we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.590" end="00:25:54.390" style="s2">circling as the tool to get real and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.730" end="00:26:06.950" style="s2">let those with holes become not</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.730" end="00:26:10.760" style="s2">withholding that&#39;s that really is</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.950" end="00:26:14.870" style="s2">beautiful it it reminds me you know just</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.760" end="00:26:16.160" style="s2">in saying that while the the practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.870" end="00:26:17.870" style="s2">has been how can I have authentic</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.160" end="00:26:20.870" style="s2">partnership between my heart and my in</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.870" end="00:26:24.110" style="s2">my mind you know some since my third eye</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.870" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">in my heart okay okay there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.110" end="00:26:28.340" style="s2">part that the workshop with hazel Crazy</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:31.370" style="s2">Eights did with me yesterday which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.340" end="00:26:34.990" style="s2">including the second chakra noticing the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.370" end="00:26:38.630" style="s2">way in which that makes it challenging</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.990" end="00:26:40.670" style="s2">and really what what you&#39;re saying it</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.630" end="00:26:45.380" style="s2">one that really excites me from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.670" end="00:26:47.240" style="s2">perspective noticing the interplay of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.380" end="00:26:51.350" style="s2">all of the all of the chakras as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.240" end="00:26:52.790" style="s2">going and in some way the I&#39;m curious if</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.350" end="00:26:54.410" style="s2">there&#39;s some way to do a topical sock</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.790" end="00:26:56.860" style="s2">circling yeah of the different chakras</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.410" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">there&#39;s really a way of including that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.860" end="00:27:02.990" style="s2">that I think is a powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:08.090" style="s2">opening myself up to myself into into</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.990" end="00:27:10.730" style="s2">into the world yeah so yeah so I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.090" end="00:27:13.430" style="s2">we sort of start with that sign in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.730" end="00:27:15.260" style="s2">this is X line and then we we seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.430" end="00:27:16.760" style="s2">you know moving to the topic of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.260" end="00:27:20.210" style="s2">masculine feminine split you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.760" end="00:27:22.060" style="s2">hearten head and if you allow me I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.210" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">introduce another frame here</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.060" end="00:27:26.810" style="s2">there&#39;s always spoken to me quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">powerfully this is from the Course in</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.810" end="00:27:34.100" style="s2">Miracles nobody&#39;s field alone nobody</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:35.750" style="s2">field alone right I think why this fits</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.100" end="00:27:37.580" style="s2">to me so powerfully is it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.750" end="00:27:38.290" style="s2">recognition that we do not exist in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.580" end="00:27:41.240" style="s2">vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.290" end="00:27:42.920" style="s2">that were deeply impacted by the social</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.240" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">conditioning and the moons and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.920" end="00:27:47.630" style="s2">conditions of the people in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">environment right and so contrast this</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.630" end="00:27:52.100" style="s2">to a postmodern idea that we all create</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:54.380" style="s2">our own reality for example you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.100" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">subtext you and you alone are</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.380" end="00:27:58.280" style="s2">responsible for your healing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:27:59.390" style="s2">transformation that&#39;s the subsets of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.280" end="00:28:00.920" style="s2">create your own reality which of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.390" end="00:28:03.740" style="s2">is true you know we obviously we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.920" end="00:28:05.030" style="s2">agreed on reality we have a choice now</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.740" end="00:28:07.510" style="s2">we respond to the people in events and</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.510" end="00:28:11.320" style="s2">and we&#39;re also you know we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.580" end="00:28:12.790" style="s2">respond creatively to the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.320" end="00:28:15.730" style="s2">arising out of our you know character</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.790" end="00:28:17.080" style="s2">ology and traumas and so forth however</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.730" end="00:28:20.590" style="s2">the idea that we create our own reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.080" end="00:28:23.410" style="s2">is a vast oversimplification of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.590" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">truth about humanity and it and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.410" end="00:28:26.380" style="s2">could actually be damaging you can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.870" style="s2">damaging because we can take this idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.380" end="00:28:29.620" style="s2">that we create on reality first of all</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.870" end="00:28:31.480" style="s2">and you sitting guilt and shame</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.620" end="00:28:33.070" style="s2">ourselves right when we&#39;re seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.480" end="00:28:37.570" style="s2">failing to create our reality that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.070" end="00:28:40.270" style="s2">like right um and it can also lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.570" end="00:28:41.980" style="s2">kind of hyper individualism in which we</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.270" end="00:28:44.020" style="s2">can imagine we can solve our problems by</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.980" end="00:28:46.140" style="s2">ourselves by some you know new and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.020" end="00:28:49.420" style="s2">improved structure of thought form right</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:50.020" style="s2">which in most cases is false that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.420" end="00:28:51.670" style="s2">gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.020" end="00:28:54.250" style="s2">you know in most cases the most direct</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.670" end="00:28:57.150" style="s2">way to solve our problems is to start</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.250" end="00:29:00.550" style="s2">showing up to ourselves and other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.150" end="00:29:01.660" style="s2">with more honesty and vulnerability okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.550" end="00:29:03.160" style="s2">I call this you know I call this</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.660" end="00:29:05.500" style="s2">communicating truth with care and care</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.160" end="00:29:08.500" style="s2">with truth and you know David when you</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.500" end="00:29:13.530" style="s2">talk about slowing down to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.500" end="00:29:18.780" style="s2">yourself that that reminds me of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.530" end="00:29:18.780" style="s2">thank you yeah that&#39;s really powerful I</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.900" end="00:29:25.930" style="s2">love I love that that observation that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.990" end="00:29:29.800" style="s2">just from the postmodern perspective we</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.930" end="00:29:31.780" style="s2">create our own reality is is a way in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.800" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">which disconnecting from it&#39;s a way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.780" end="00:29:38.590" style="s2">could be used to disconnect from myself</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:40.930" style="s2">and it can be a victim blaming and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.590" end="00:29:42.190" style="s2">independent I don&#39;t need you and all you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.930" end="00:29:43.540" style="s2">know since you&#39;re creating your own the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.190" end="00:29:44.890" style="s2">rally to stop it up and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.540" end="00:29:47.590" style="s2">let&#39;s get let&#39;s actually just connect</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.890" end="00:29:50.710" style="s2">right so both of those have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.590" end="00:29:53.050" style="s2">doing thing is this this actually speaks</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.710" end="00:29:54.700" style="s2">Marco you know and I yep you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.050" end="00:29:57.550" style="s2">talked about that idea this concept that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.700" end="00:30:00.010" style="s2">I that I have the opposable self yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.550" end="00:30:02.560" style="s2">talk about that in smooth way so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.010" end="00:30:05.590" style="s2">that sense of the opposable self like an</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.560" end="00:30:10.510" style="s2">opposable thumb are distinct</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.590" end="00:30:13.240" style="s2">perspectives that come together and if</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.510" end="00:30:16.200" style="s2">I&#39;m not aware of the connection it comes</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.240" end="00:30:18.820" style="s2">across as opposition allottee of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.200" end="00:30:20.050" style="s2">either-or thinking in which there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.820" end="00:30:21.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of head-butting and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.050" end="00:30:25.179" style="s2">fighting over the tree</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.510" end="00:30:27.100" style="s2">and from the point of contact where the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.179" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">you know if I imagine where my fingers</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.100" end="00:30:31.150" style="s2">and thumb touch that from Metta</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:33.340" style="s2">opposition ality if there&#39;s a fight I</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.150" end="00:30:35.650" style="s2">actually can&#39;t get the sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.340" end="00:30:38.380" style="s2">perspective because I&#39;m asserting my</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.650" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">perspective so much but the real sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.380" end="00:30:42.940" style="s2">of it is the dance happens whenever I</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:45.280" style="s2">find our commonality I really the Union</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.940" end="00:30:50.110" style="s2">at the other end which is really deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.280" end="00:30:51.929" style="s2">within myself so the deep sense of where</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.110" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">I&#39;m actually connected to myself is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.929" end="00:30:56.110" style="s2">specifically the point that feels most</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.070" end="00:30:58.360" style="s2">challenged in that oppositional</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.110" end="00:31:01.179" style="s2">perspective and when I can be with</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.360" end="00:31:02.530" style="s2">myself there suddenly something opens up</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.179" end="00:31:05.830" style="s2">in something shifts and I can hear</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.530" end="00:31:08.830" style="s2">myself and hear you newly and the dance</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.830" end="00:31:10.299" style="s2">really becomes possible right right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.830" end="00:31:12.340" style="s2">back to you know just to reiterate the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.299" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">idea of the emotional possible brain our</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.340" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">brains are designed to be opposable so</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:20.890" style="s2">that the two parts can get into</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">connection and reach a higher</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.890" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">integration yes right right and and when</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:29.650" style="s2">they&#39;re just off there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">dissonance and actually it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.650" end="00:31:33.940" style="s2">dissonance if I&#39;m listening closely to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:36.850" style="s2">the dissonance and how the in dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.940" end="00:31:41.710" style="s2">impacts me rather than trying to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.850" end="00:31:44.500" style="s2">dissonance I actually can become in</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.710" end="00:31:51.330" style="s2">harmony just from noticing the point of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.500" end="00:31:51.330" style="s2">impact sweet yeah listen it doe</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.500" end="00:32:07.000" style="s2">alright the subject comes up yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.929" end="00:32:09.100" style="s2">talked about that a lot as well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.000" end="00:32:12.970" style="s2">another there&#39;s another aspect of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.100" end="00:32:14.679" style="s2">which there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.970" end="00:32:17.650" style="s2">what you were saying before that freedom</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.679" end="00:32:20.020" style="s2">of choice that exact science speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.650" end="00:32:21.370" style="s2">this as well right there&#39;s a we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.020" end="00:32:22.990" style="s2">starting to get to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.370" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">freewill is actually brought into</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.990" end="00:32:28.210" style="s2">question yeah I love that that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.840" end="00:32:31.210" style="s2">that the legal system is toy based on</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.210" end="00:32:33.070" style="s2">existence of free will yet there&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.210" end="00:32:37.570" style="s2">this idea and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.070" end="00:32:40.450" style="s2">learn more about it that that maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.570" end="00:32:43.690" style="s2">can&#39;t count on free will and holding</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.450" end="00:32:45.700" style="s2">people accountable right well in that so</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.690" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">and I&#39;ve wrestled with this myself so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.700" end="00:32:50.470" style="s2">many times what I notice here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:54.970" style="s2">interesting is as I look at it it looks</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.470" end="00:32:57.549" style="s2">like where I have freedom is in choosing</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.970" end="00:32:59.740" style="s2">the context with which I&#39;m interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.549" end="00:33:01.029" style="s2">the frame you know what this</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.740" end="00:33:05.379" style="s2">conversation is about</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.029" end="00:33:07.059" style="s2">so the impact the impact I actually can</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.379" end="00:33:09.669" style="s2">shift right what happened happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.059" end="00:33:11.350" style="s2">what&#39;s in the room is in the room but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.669" end="00:33:16.120" style="s2">can actually listen from different</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.350" end="00:33:18.659" style="s2">perspectives and settled into myself so</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.120" end="00:33:22.360" style="s2">the point of opposed ability in a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.659" end="00:33:25.899" style="s2">can shift in a way that opens up the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.360" end="00:33:28.450" style="s2">conversation and it&#39;s specifically for</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.899" end="00:33:32.220" style="s2">me being attached to one specific</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.450" end="00:33:34.899" style="s2">perspective that makes that hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.220" end="00:33:38.289" style="s2">but when I notice I can relax the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.899" end="00:33:41.370" style="s2">attachment to one perspective I then can</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.289" end="00:33:44.940" style="s2">allow other perspectives to arise and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.370" end="00:33:47.980" style="s2">bring myself from that from that frame</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.940" end="00:33:51.179" style="s2">for me real truth is paradox</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.980" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe something until I find</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.179" end="00:34:01.059" style="s2">some contradiction to it or some anti</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:34:03.100" style="s2">truth to it I don&#39;t think real truth is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.059" end="00:34:07.990" style="s2">just simple statements of the sky is</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.100" end="00:34:10.329" style="s2">blue right when they think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.990" end="00:34:11.940" style="s2">exactly what exacts then guys next time</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.329" end="00:34:13.750" style="s2">is saying you know real truth is uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.940" end="00:34:16.929" style="s2">extraordinaire in the complex in both</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.750" end="00:34:19.179" style="s2">modernism and post-modernism you know or</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.929" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">maybe you know make a farce of the job</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.179" end="00:34:25.409" style="s2">of actually finding real truths right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:28.359" style="s2">you know I think my thought on this</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.409" end="00:34:32.560" style="s2">guy&#39;s is I actually pretty firmly</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.359" end="00:34:34.569" style="s2">believe that we have much less free will</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.560" end="00:34:36.609" style="s2">and then we imagine because we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.569" end="00:34:39.339" style="s2">basically you know controlled by both</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.609" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">social conditioning and by what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.339" end="00:34:43.960" style="s2">culture you know physio physiological</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">patterns you know obsessive brain loops</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.960" end="00:34:48.730" style="s2">physiologic loops etc addictions</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:52.780" style="s2">third the third new thing is is our gut</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.730" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">enzyme our gut yes yes well what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.780" end="00:34:56.530" style="s2">called the brain stomach link that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:34:59.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of research and discovery</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.530" end="00:35:01.510" style="s2">being made about that like we almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.980" end="00:35:03.310" style="s2">have a second plane it we almost have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.510" end="00:35:04.840" style="s2">second brain in a digestive system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.310" end="00:35:07.540" style="s2">exact it&#39;s not a brain it&#39;s a collection</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.840" end="00:35:09.360" style="s2">of microorganisms that are not right</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.540" end="00:35:13.270" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.360" end="00:35:14.619" style="s2">yes so anyway but this mover it&#39;s back</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.270" end="00:35:16.119" style="s2">to what what you were saying David is</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.619" end="00:35:17.830" style="s2">that you know even even if it&#39;s only</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.830" end="00:35:26.760" style="s2">we want by gaining awareness of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.940" end="00:35:29.700" style="s2">areas where that may be true</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.760" end="00:35:31.900" style="s2">paradoxically it gives us more free well</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.700" end="00:35:32.710" style="s2">absolutely right and I mean it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.900" end="00:35:34.090" style="s2">certainly give us more peace and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.710" end="00:35:35.380" style="s2">happiness in relaxation because because</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:04.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right that sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.609" end="00:36:06.040" style="s2">that by actually naming that point it</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.270" end="00:36:08.080" style="s2">feels like I mean the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.040" end="00:36:09.609" style="s2">amazing is it&#39;s I almost want to fight</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.080" end="00:36:14.080" style="s2">against the idea that I don&#39;t have free</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.609" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">will I want to I want to you know it</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.080" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">reminds me of in the in the matrix maybe</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:31.960" style="s2">feeling that you&#39;re out of control</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.270" end="00:36:38.830" style="s2">is almost untenable that you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.230" end="00:36:50.470" style="s2">willing to contemplate the question</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.550" end="00:36:53.890" style="s2">you&#39;re automatically a victim of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.470" end="00:36:55.390" style="s2">question right thank it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.890" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">actually what&#39;s that movie again</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.010" end="00:37:09.130" style="s2">movie really it&#39;s a psychologically very</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.880" end="00:37:11.470" style="s2">very brilliant movie there&#39;s I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.130" end="00:37:14.500" style="s2">bring it back Marco - we had an earlier</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.470" end="00:37:17.380" style="s2">conversation about this idea of the cult</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.500" end="00:37:18.910" style="s2">I wanna I wanna yes yes let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.380" end="00:37:20.380" style="s2">let&#39;s wrap it up with that if we could</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.910" end="00:37:23.560" style="s2">because I don&#39;t got we got some good</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.380" end="00:37:25.300" style="s2">content here so so part of where this</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.560" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">comes to mind I mean it&#39;s in in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.300" end="00:37:30.130" style="s2">all the time when I think about</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:33.190" style="s2">intentional community and utopian</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.130" end="00:37:35.260" style="s2">visions I&#39;m aware that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.190" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s unaddressed in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.260" end="00:37:39.400" style="s2">there&#39;s something that seems to go</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:41.350" style="s2">sideways almost every time and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.400" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">particularly just recently I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.350" end="00:37:46.390" style="s2">watching the mini series on Netflix for</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.510" end="00:37:51.700" style="s2">wild walled country where Osho or Shree</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.390" end="00:37:55.390" style="s2">Rajneesh has been you know it&#39;s such it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.700" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">with so sideways yeah and yeah I watched</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.390" end="00:38:01.540" style="s2">that I watched that for six hours</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:05.410" style="s2">straight by the way David I think four</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.540" end="00:38:07.600" style="s2">am wow that&#39;s pretty it&#39;s a it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.410" end="00:38:09.820" style="s2">powerful and impacting just to watch</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.600" end="00:38:13.020" style="s2">from both sides right the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.820" end="00:38:17.020" style="s2">so amazing is watching the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.020" end="00:38:22.390" style="s2">both the rajneeshees and the Oregonians</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.020" end="00:38:26.920" style="s2">were willing to fort their values in</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.390" end="00:38:29.380" style="s2">order to get to some perceived some</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.920" end="00:38:33.700" style="s2">perceived need met and completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:37.020" style="s2">obliterating both of their truths the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.700" end="00:38:40.270" style="s2">state of driz in order to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.020" end="00:38:43.270" style="s2">and and and so the question for me is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.270" end="00:38:46.630" style="s2">how do we be aware of that so that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.270" end="00:38:48.310" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sneak up and I mean it&#39;s so it</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.630" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">was so interesting you it&#39;s clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.310" end="00:38:55.270" style="s2">point where they&#39;re not acting from free</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:57.910" style="s2">will okay and so the question for me is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.270" end="00:39:00.280" style="s2">how do we start this conversation in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.910" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">way that doesn&#39;t lead to that same kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.280" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">of self delusional chasing myself down</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:09.850" style="s2">that rabbit hole and losing the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:12.119" style="s2">essence of what it is that I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.850" end="00:39:12.119" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.260" end="00:39:16.860" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s sort of the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.760" end="00:39:18.990" style="s2">really what we&#39;re trying we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.860" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">achieve here the accessible brain I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.990" end="00:39:22.680" style="s2">holding the two perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:24.120" style="s2">simultaneously and well so the shift</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.680" end="00:39:27.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve made in the conversation here is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.120" end="00:39:30.660" style="s2">about taking that freewill part to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.810" end="00:39:33.750" style="s2">community and what point does the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.660" end="00:39:38.630" style="s2">community take away free will from its</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.750" end="00:39:44.520" style="s2">members through cultish or influence or</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.630" end="00:39:48.630" style="s2">culture of that community and at what</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.520" end="00:39:50.250" style="s2">forty Turk are people yeah wait and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.630" end="00:39:51.810" style="s2">extremely happy that you named that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.250" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">Darryl as you are you know the official</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.810" end="00:39:59.580" style="s2">leader of the camp contacts cult yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.540" end="00:40:01.170" style="s2">sure sure sure as as it were I don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.580" end="00:40:05.570" style="s2">and I worked very hard and asked myself</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.170" end="00:40:08.850" style="s2">constantly how does this community of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.570" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">dancers and and people going to Burning</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.850" end="00:40:17.610" style="s2">Man festivals exercise its free will and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:21.660" style="s2">we&#39;re not a democratic we don&#39;t use a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.610" end="00:40:26.550" style="s2">democratic model we don&#39;t use consensus</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.660" end="00:40:27.630" style="s2">per se and and you know the other part</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.550" end="00:40:32.580" style="s2">of that question is how can we make it</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.630" end="00:40:34.740" style="s2">most efficient to people do that so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.580" end="00:40:37.980" style="s2">there&#39;s things like to AH Krissy and how</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.740" end="00:40:40.230" style="s2">does just tributed leadership happen or</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.980" end="00:40:42.060" style="s2">collaborative leadership happen and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.230" end="00:40:44.790" style="s2">things like holacracy and Scioscia cracy</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.060" end="00:40:48.210" style="s2">come to mind but I&#39;m not sure those are</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.790" end="00:40:49.800" style="s2">are suitable for that either</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.210" end="00:40:52.830" style="s2">all the way but there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.800" end="00:40:55.770" style="s2">parts of it that can come and and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.830" end="00:40:58.290" style="s2">how does this expand out and to the rest</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.770" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">of society which leads me back to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.290" end="00:41:05.900" style="s2">that question what is the the biological</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">based mission statement what what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.900" end="00:41:13.230" style="s2">what are all of our organisms trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">do day in day out and how can we make it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.230" end="00:41:21.120" style="s2">more efficient or more practical and not</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:22.440" style="s2">waste people&#39;s energies or have people</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.120" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">going off in different directions that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.440" end="00:41:25.670" style="s2">that don&#39;t serve that that greater</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:27.900" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.670" end="00:41:29.400" style="s2">and you know what they&#39;re like I gotta</p>
