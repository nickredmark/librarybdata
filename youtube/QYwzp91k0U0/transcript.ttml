<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">and now it becomes like the people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">are left behind still thinking it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:50.580" style="s2">people who are going through it to share</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.670" end="00:09:52.830" style="s2">the journey with but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.580" end="00:09:54.810" style="s2">I&#39;m like it was this is at the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.830" end="00:09:58.050" style="s2">I&#39;m just getting now is at the end of my</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.810" end="00:10:01.710" style="s2">pregnancy which I really wanted I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.050" end="00:10:04.080" style="s2">like she was a planned wanted baby and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.710" end="00:10:06.840" style="s2">at the end of the pregnancy I was like</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.080" end="00:10:08.130" style="s2">oh I&#39;ve never been more pro-life and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.840" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">pro-choice at the same time like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.130" end="00:10:13.740" style="s2">like both simultaneously oh I could have</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.440" end="00:10:15.870" style="s2">like this life could have been ended and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.740" end="00:10:18.180" style="s2">she wouldn&#39;t exist and that seems weird</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.870" end="00:10:19.170" style="s2">to me and also oh my god someone would</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.180" end="00:10:22.170" style="s2">have to go through this pregnancy</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.170" end="00:10:24.810" style="s2"> without like wanting to have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.170" end="00:10:27.000" style="s2">baby that seems absolutely abhorrent</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.810" end="00:10:28.680" style="s2">like that we would require someone to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.000" end="00:10:32.180" style="s2">through that in their body to carry a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.680" end="00:10:34.740" style="s2">baby pushed or cut a baby out and like</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.180" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">all of the hormones that go with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.740" end="00:10:38.400" style="s2">afterwards like all of it is like yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:40.650" style="s2">that would be absolutely horrible if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.400" end="00:10:43.650" style="s2">force that on on people and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.650" end="00:10:44.790" style="s2">somewhat not okay like really it just</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.650" end="00:10:46.020" style="s2">made me more pro-choice but I did</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.790" end="00:10:49.650" style="s2">understand that little bit of pro-life</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.020" end="00:10:51.930" style="s2">Oh weird that I would be and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.650" end="00:10:55.350" style="s2">same to me with the like genders lock is</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.930" end="00:10:56.760" style="s2">like okay how important it is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.350" end="00:10:58.410" style="s2">everyone goes through this because our</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.760" end="00:11:00.180" style="s2">society&#39;s better for people having gone</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.410" end="00:11:01.620" style="s2">through this but also some people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.180" end="00:11:04.770" style="s2">ready to go through this like some</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.620" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">people and yet just by the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.770" end="00:11:08.279" style="s2">gender non-conforming people just by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:09.870" style="s2">existence of like them walk</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.279" end="00:11:13.290" style="s2">in the world confronting people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.870" end="00:11:16.139" style="s2">subconscious bias and all like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.290" end="00:11:18.779" style="s2">going on here somebody to dress well so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.139" end="00:11:21.329" style="s2">I spatial hair like this is just blown</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.779" end="00:11:23.339" style="s2">and it&#39;s like what we need is our mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.329" end="00:11:25.259" style="s2">blown on regular basis but also if</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.339" end="00:11:27.749" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not in a state to be able</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.259" end="00:11:30.449" style="s2">to accept those things like put somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.749" end="00:11:32.009" style="s2">on that path seems also not very very in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.449" end="00:11:33.629" style="s2">so like finding the balancing act like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.009" end="00:11:35.069" style="s2">to say no you have to accept me and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.629" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">dare you trigger me and use all my right</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.069" end="00:11:38.579" style="s2">pronouns at the same time your trick</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.970" style="s2">like by existing your sugar and other</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.579" end="00:11:48.059" style="s2">people and having some compassion for</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.970" end="00:11:49.499" style="s2">that because there is I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.059" end="00:11:52.709" style="s2">to say that everyone needs to be as</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.499" end="00:11:54.779" style="s2">involved as you but then people like not</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.709" end="00:11:56.249" style="s2">above not below like just exactly like</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.779" end="00:11:57.629" style="s2">it&#39;s like everything I&#39;m awoke to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.249" end="00:11:59.220" style="s2">everyone else should be awake to and</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.420" end="00:13:55.350" style="s2">because you&#39;re not in their body and</p>
