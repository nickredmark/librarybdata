<p begin="00:00:00.219" end="00:00:05.549" style="s2">This is Jocko podcast number 155 with me Jocko Willington</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.559" end="00:00:10.739" style="s2">On the island</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.009" end="00:00:14.009" style="s2">The dead were piling up</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.679" end="00:00:18.868" style="s2">In the mission report the head of the convoy wrote</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.990" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">At 2 pm. On May 20th. I went to the island of Nazino with commander Tsepkov</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.869" end="00:00:34.558" style="s2">There was a terrible scramble people crowding and fighting around the bags of flour</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.250" end="00:00:39.869" style="s2">Dead bodies everywhere a hundred or more and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.540" end="00:00:48.539" style="s2">Lots of people crawling about and crying give us bread boss. It&#39;s been two days since we&#39;ve been given anything to eat</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.590" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">They&#39;re trying to make us die of hunger and the cold</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.620" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">They told us that people had begun eating the dead bodies</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.739" end="00:01:05.188" style="s2">That they were cooking human flesh</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.720" end="00:01:11.459" style="s2">The scene on the island was dreadful appalling</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">On May 21st alone</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.350" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">The three health officers counted 70 additional dead bodies in five cases, they emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.720" end="00:01:33.089" style="s2">The liver the heart the lungs and fleshy part of bodies had been cut off</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.079" end="00:01:40.349" style="s2">On one of the bodies the head had been torn off along the along with the male</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.049" end="00:01:43.859" style="s2">genital organs and part of the skin</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:54.089" style="s2">These mutilations constitute strong evidence of cannibalistic acts in addition they suggest the existence of serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.750" end="00:01:57.219" style="s2">Psychopathologies</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.219" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">On the same day May 21st, the deportees themselves brought us three individuals who had been caught</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.619" end="00:02:07.619" style="s2">with blood on their hands and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.170" end="00:02:10.170" style="s2">holding human livers</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:17.960" style="s2">Our examination of these three individuals did not reveal any extreme emaciation</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:32.240" style="s2">And there&#39;s an elderly local peasant woman who reported the things we saw</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">People were dying everywhere they were killing each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:41.060" style="s2">There was a guard named Costilla</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.420" end="00:02:47.989" style="s2">Viniq off a young fellow. He was courting a pretty girl who had been sent there. He protected her</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.410" end="00:02:51.619" style="s2">One day he had to be away for a while</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.430" end="00:02:56.270" style="s2">And he told one of his comrades take care of her</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:00.470" style="s2">But with all the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.110" end="00:03:03.110" style="s2">The comrade couldn&#39;t do much</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:12.380" style="s2">People caught the girl tied her to a tree caught off her breasts her muscles everything they could eat</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.000" end="00:03:17.000" style="s2">They were hungry</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">They had to eat when costia came back</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.959" end="00:03:23.959" style="s2">She was still alive he</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">Tried to save her but she had lost too much blood. She</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">Died</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:36.410" style="s2">That was the kind of thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.100" end="00:03:41.779" style="s2">When you went along the island you saw flesh wrapped in rags</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.190" end="00:03:49.100" style="s2">Human flesh that had been cut and hung in the trees</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:04:00.800" style="s2">And that right there is from a book called cannibal Island by Nicolas Werth</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">Who&#39;s written books about communism I think his most famous is the black book of communism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:13.819" style="s2">cannibal Island specifically breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:16.519" style="s2">one of the small</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:20.209" style="s2">individual nightmares of the Soviet gulags</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:24.650" style="s2">But the nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:26.990" style="s2">Was not small</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.850" style="s2">And it certainly was not specific. It was a widespread and it was broad and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.090" end="00:04:35.090" style="s2">It was almost incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:42.139" style="s2">And very little about it would be known or not for one man</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.070" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:47.970" style="s2">Who?</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.970" end="00:04:50.600" style="s2">not only survived the gulags but</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:53.669" style="s2">lived on to write</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.669" end="00:04:55.669" style="s2">incredibly detailed and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.550" end="00:05:00.829" style="s2">Very well researched two books about the gulags. Some of them were fictionalized</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">Like a day in the life of Ivan Denisovich</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.580" end="00:05:06.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.840" end="00:05:14.780" style="s2">for the for the good of the cause, but most comprehensively in his three-volume tome The Gulag Archipelago and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.229" end="00:05:22.729" style="s2">This series is is a massive series and it&#39;s been cut down to an abridged version that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.700" end="00:05:26.089" style="s2">was actually approved by the author himself and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:32.959" style="s2">The abridged version has just been re-released in Europe with a foreword by a man that I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:41.179" style="s2">Repopulated a to discuss that book and among other things. I&#39;m sure a man</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:46.789" style="s2">That I needed to give an introduction to the first time. He was on this podcast, but</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.799" style="s2">now who needs no introduction whatsoever a man by the name of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.889" end="00:05:54.889" style="s2">Dr. Jordan B Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.950" end="00:05:57.950" style="s2">Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.010" end="00:06:00.010" style="s2">Thank you for coming back on</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.040" end="00:06:03.939" style="s2">How does it rough beginning chuckle Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.990" end="00:06:07.990" style="s2">Yeah, I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.390" end="00:06:10.390" style="s2">Remember when I started listening to you?</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.970" end="00:06:14.109" style="s2">You would say something along the lines of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.110" end="00:06:19.389" style="s2">you know, we are quite capable of creating hell for ourselves as human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.380" end="00:06:22.730" style="s2">That</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.730" end="00:06:28.359" style="s2">Clearly that situation. I don&#39;t know. I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s hell. Yeah, and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.540" end="00:06:30.950" style="s2">Close enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.950" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">Yeah, and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s created by us. It&#39;s created by us, which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.160" end="00:06:40.209" style="s2">Obviously horrific and the Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.300" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">You know you talked about that book a lot and and one of the things that on that book hits you hard, obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.370" end="00:06:55.359" style="s2">For me, there&#39;s a book called about face by by colonel. David hackworth. I&#39;m from a different</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.120" end="00:06:58.120" style="s2">World, I guess that you in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.910" end="00:07:02.170" style="s2">The book that hit me hardest in my life was was that book?</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.110" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">about face and it&#39;s it&#39;s one of those things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.040" end="00:07:11.679" style="s2">when I read it, I started putting it together as like things started to fit and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.180" end="00:07:18.880" style="s2">Remember that and I was wondering I guess from my perspective at what point did you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.970" end="00:07:25.480" style="s2">Read the Gulag Archipelago. And at what point did you start to say?</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.990" end="00:07:32.590" style="s2">Okay, there&#39;s something really really important here for me to try and understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:35.049" style="s2">well, I read it back in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.690" end="00:07:38.440" style="s2">1980s early I would say</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.560" end="00:07:41.949" style="s2">I&#39;d read some Solzhenitsyn before that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.950" end="00:07:48.490" style="s2">I read the ley de Dave day in the life of Ivan Denisovich when I was about 13 or 14 and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.950" end="00:07:52.930" style="s2">Then I read the Gulag Archipelago in my early 20s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.780" end="00:08:01.089" style="s2">when I was reading a lot of psychological material too when I started reading Jung and Freud and the great clinicians and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.820" end="00:08:05.860" style="s2">I was reading a fair bit about what had happened in Nazi Germany at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.860" end="00:08:09.429" style="s2">and also Victor Frankel&#39;s met man&#39;s search for meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.780" end="00:08:15.689" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s book is in some ways like an elaborated extension of Frankle, Frankle</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.690" end="00:08:21.480" style="s2">Of course described what happened to him in the Nazi concentration camps and it&#39;s a relatively short book and it&#39;s a great book</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.610" end="00:08:28.469" style="s2">but Solzhenitsyn&#39;s book is it&#39;s it&#39;s much broader and and I would say deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.830" end="00:08:31.830" style="s2">the thing that affected me</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:38.850" style="s2">Most particularly was the psychological take on the on the totalitarian states, you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.850" end="00:08:42.449" style="s2">I had been studying political science up to that point and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.050" end="00:08:48.990" style="s2">The political science scientists and the economists who I would say were</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:55.529" style="s2">Under the sway of Marxist thinking although not nearly to the degree that they are now</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.200" end="00:08:58.259" style="s2">were convinced that the reason that people</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:02.369" style="s2">engaged in conflict was basically a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.980" end="00:09:09.269" style="s2">Argumentation over resources, you know, it&#39;s basically an economic argument and I never bought that it never made sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.270" end="00:09:12.030" style="s2">I mean, obviously there are circumstances where that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.030" end="00:09:17.819" style="s2">But it didn&#39;t seem to be fundamentally the case like tribal warfare isn&#39;t precisely about resources</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.820" end="00:09:22.679" style="s2">It&#39;s maybe it&#39;s about territory, or maybe it&#39;s about identity, but it never seemed to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.260" end="00:09:25.260" style="s2">simply about resources</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.810" end="00:09:27.580" style="s2">partly because</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.580" end="00:09:29.850" style="s2">Well a resource is something that people value</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.490" end="00:09:35.670" style="s2">But it isn&#39;t obvious why people value what they value and so it doesn&#39;t solve the fundamental problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.740" end="00:09:38.940" style="s2">anyways when I was reading Frankel and Solzhenitsyn, I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.490" end="00:09:44.700" style="s2">started to more deeply understand the relationship between the individual and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.550" end="00:09:47.260" style="s2">atrocity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.260" end="00:09:49.739" style="s2">That&#39;s what I found. Most interesting was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.710" end="00:09:57.629" style="s2">Frankel&#39;s claim and Solzhenitsyn&#39;s claim as well that it was the moral corruption of the citizenry that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.020" end="00:10:01.020" style="s2">allowed the totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.540" end="00:10:05.009" style="s2">catastrophes to occur and that that in some sense was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.290" end="00:10:12.929" style="s2">responsibility of every individual in the system who looked the other way or who participated actively I mean even in the gulag camps</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.810" end="00:10:17.970" style="s2">Themselves they were almost all run by the prisoners there wasn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:24.149" style="s2">Administrative manpower to run the prison system without the cooperation so to speak the prisoners</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.149" end="00:10:28.559" style="s2">So it is it is a surreal sort of hell where?</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.170" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">You imprison yourself and Solzhenitsyn&#39;s fundamental claim and this was true for Frankel as well and also for vaclav havel</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.310" end="00:10:38.459" style="s2">who eventually became president of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.190" end="00:10:41.999" style="s2">Czechoslovakia, or at least of the Czech Republic? I don&#39;t remember which</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:48.779" style="s2">you know, they believed that it was the individual proclivity to accept lies that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.440" end="00:10:54.390" style="s2">Fostered the ability of tyrants to destroy the state and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.500" end="00:11:04.440" style="s2">Well, and that also led to complicitous with regards to all the absolute atrocities that were occurring in both the Nazi state in the and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.510" end="00:11:08.999" style="s2">In the Soviet state and I think that&#39;s true when I read like I read</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.310" end="00:11:11.190" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s books and a lot of the books</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.190" end="00:11:18.089" style="s2">I read about Nazi Germany - not as a victim and not as a hero, but as a perpetrator, you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.089" end="00:11:19.480" style="s2">Which I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.480" end="00:11:25.649" style="s2">It&#39;s something that&#39;s really important to do when you read history is that it&#39;s easy to cast yourself as a victim</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.410" end="00:11:30.450" style="s2">It&#39;s easy to cast yourself as the person who would have been heroic in the circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.520" end="00:11:36.179" style="s2">But it&#39;s also unbelievably useful to understand that there&#39;s a good chance had you been in those</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.029" end="00:11:42.269" style="s2">Situations that you wouldn&#39;t have been on the side of the good guys, you know, and that&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.270" end="00:11:45.389" style="s2">it&#39;s really a terrible realization, but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:48.270" style="s2">It&#39;s necessary realization</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.899" end="00:11:51.899" style="s2">Again just going back to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.300" end="00:11:56.909" style="s2">what you get out of reading because people ask me how cuz I read books all the time on my podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.970" end="00:12:01.260" style="s2">what you just said it struck me as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.100" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">People have told me I read that book before but I didn&#39;t really get out of it what you got out of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:13.049" style="s2">And when I heard you read it I said I was saying wow</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.050" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">How did I need to go reread this book?</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:20.429" style="s2">And I think one of the key things is you looked at these books as you were not the victim</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.430" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">But the perpetrator one thing that when I read books, I know I read a lot of books mostly about war</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.769" end="00:12:28.769" style="s2">for me I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.810" end="00:12:32.429" style="s2">Always think about the the peep. I don&#39;t know we see myself as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.100" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">Person that goes and heroically storms the beaches and survives</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.150" end="00:12:41.000" style="s2">Every you know in a war book</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.000" end="00:12:46.130" style="s2">there&#39;s these people that get mentioned for a for up for a half a paragraph or for two sentences and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.380" end="00:12:49.640" style="s2">They sometimes they don&#39;t even have a name because you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.640" end="00:12:55.489" style="s2">You&#39;re the battalion commander storming the beach at Normandy. You don&#39;t you you&#39;re not gonna name every single person but for some reason and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.100" end="00:13:02.689" style="s2">Maybe it&#39;s just my experiences of being in combat when I read about that two sentences of that guy</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.300" end="00:13:06.859" style="s2">That that gets shot that gets killed that gets blown up. I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.340" end="00:13:09.780" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.780" end="00:13:11.570" style="s2">Understand and relate to that person</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.570" end="00:13:18.439" style="s2">like I don&#39;t just see it as me being the guy that is always winning and always doing okay and always surviving I</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.170" end="00:13:22.159" style="s2">Feel and relate to those guys</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.620" end="00:13:27.830" style="s2">that didn&#39;t and and part of that is just because of my friends that I lost in combat like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.680" end="00:13:29.970" style="s2">those guys</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.970" end="00:13:32.239" style="s2">that they&#39;re they&#39;re people and and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.610" end="00:13:37.880" style="s2">Key thing of of reading it and going man every single person like when you read about these girl</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.880" end="00:13:42.350" style="s2">You&#39;re talking about millions of people that were tortured died murdered</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:48.859" style="s2">Every one of those people key word is people every one of those people is a person</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:50.970" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.970" end="00:13:52.970" style="s2">to your point</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.980" end="00:13:54.980" style="s2">every single one of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.050" end="00:13:58.279" style="s2">executioner&#39;s every single one of those murderers is</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.280" end="00:14:01.280" style="s2">Also a person, you know, there&#39;s a great book called</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.100" end="00:14:06.199" style="s2">Ordinary men. Oh, yeah. We we reviewed that on this podcast. Right, right</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.200" end="00:14:06.920" style="s2">and so, you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.920" end="00:14:11.539" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the greatest books written about what happened in the Second World War</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">I think on the end of on the atrocity end</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.990" end="00:14:17.100" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.100" end="00:14:23.719" style="s2">the author does such a lovely job of while it&#39;s a strange way of putting it in this context, but you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.720" end="00:14:30.199" style="s2">it&#39;s about this police battalion that was moved into Poland after the Germans went through and and occupied the country and they were there to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.360" end="00:14:35.990" style="s2">Establish order like police do but also to participate in the mopping up. Let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.510" end="00:14:39.859" style="s2">That was part and parcel of the war and you know, these were ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.410" end="00:14:42.060" style="s2">policemen</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.060" end="00:14:46.850" style="s2">middle-class guys most of whom had been educated and socialized before the Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.060" end="00:14:51.359" style="s2">Propaganda machine really got rolling. They weren&#39;t like Hitler Youth types</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.540" end="00:14:55.589" style="s2">Mm-hmm. They were ordinary men and they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.350" end="00:14:58.529" style="s2">Brought and they had a commander who?</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:05.130" style="s2">had made an explicit case that if they weren&#39;t able to tolerate the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.889" end="00:15:12.809" style="s2">Conditions in Poland that they could go home. So there was no top-down order that you had to do this or else and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:15.300" style="s2">Then they were you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.300" end="00:15:21.209" style="s2">first of all, they started rounding up while mostly Jewish people men between 18 and 65 and then you know,</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.209" end="00:15:23.209" style="s2">They started to participate in the entire</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.410" end="00:15:24.149" style="s2">atrocious mess</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.149" end="00:15:24.579" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.579" end="00:15:30.599" style="s2">they were they ended up many of them taking naked pregnant women out into fields and shooting them in the back of the head and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.730" end="00:15:35.399" style="s2">What the author does is outline how that happens to you?</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.399" end="00:15:41.669" style="s2">you know one step at a time and so it&#39;s a really horrifying book and it&#39;s a brilliant book because</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:45.600" style="s2">There&#39;s no attempt to make the perpetrators</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.120" end="00:15:53.669" style="s2">Like some creatures that aren&#39;t human like just pure Psychopaths and of course in in a situation like Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.670" end="00:16:00.149" style="s2">Germany and and in the horrors of the communist States there was no shortage of places for Psychopaths to prevail</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.149" end="00:16:02.189" style="s2">But that&#39;s not really the issue. The issue is</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:05.459" style="s2">Well, how does an ordinary person?</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.190" end="00:16:12.239" style="s2">Come to participate in a global horror. Let&#39;s say and what does that mean about being an ordinary person?</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:15.329" style="s2">And then the next question is well, what does it mean about how you should?</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.850" end="00:16:19.260" style="s2">Conduct your life and one of the things that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.260" end="00:16:22.769" style="s2">I think what happened to me when I read all this material in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.350" end="00:16:25.000" style="s2">was that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.000" end="00:16:26.290" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.290" end="00:16:32.459" style="s2">Convinced that there wasn&#39;t anything more important to do in the aftermath of what had happened in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:37.529" style="s2">then to try to build people who were responsible enough as</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.170" end="00:16:42.149" style="s2">truth-telling courageous responsible citizens, so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.579" end="00:16:43.390" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.390" end="00:16:44.680" style="s2">probability would</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.680" end="00:16:50.909" style="s2">Increase that if they were in a position to make a terrible choice that they would make the right one and I would say this</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.190" end="00:16:53.459" style="s2">lecture tour that I&#39;m doing which is now</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.010" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">Extended over more than a hundred cities</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.100" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">Is an extension of the same thing?</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:16:59.339" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.339" end="00:17:03.029" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the same thing that you&#39;re trying to do with your book like we were just looking at</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.240" end="00:17:06.779" style="s2">My key in the Dragons book, right and you&#39;re trying to lay out</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.230" end="00:17:09.490" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.490" end="00:17:12.419" style="s2">psychological pathway that guides people towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.240" end="00:17:17.909" style="s2">responsibility and courage and truth and all of that and that is the bulwark against tyranny, and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.039" end="00:17:21.689" style="s2">Actually the in debts actually at the individual level and we kind of know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.909" end="00:17:26.249" style="s2">Like we we know that in the West I think that&#39;s part of the core ethos of well</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.250" end="00:17:32.729" style="s2">Certainly the of the English common law system certainly of the American way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.730" end="00:17:38.549" style="s2">Is that each citizen is the bulwark against tyranny? And that&#39;s actually true</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.549" end="00:17:44.429" style="s2">It&#39;s and and that&#39;s a terrible thing to think through because it means that you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.950" end="00:17:51.569" style="s2">Responsible for the integrity or lack thereof of your state and it&#39;s it&#39;s on you, you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.570" end="00:17:56.939" style="s2">And and there&#39;s something great about that because it means that your existence actually matters</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.220" end="00:18:03.750" style="s2">To you and to your family and and to the broader community in a really major way in a way. That&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.419" end="00:18:08.129" style="s2">significant than you might think and that the your</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.130" end="00:18:11.130" style="s2">proclivity to abdicate your moral responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.130" end="00:18:17.099" style="s2">Echo&#39;s way farther than you might consider especially under some circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.169" end="00:18:23.158" style="s2">you know in Solzhenitsyn one of the things that&#39;s so amazing about the Gulag Archipelago is his stories not only of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.740" end="00:18:28.049" style="s2">absolute bloody catastrophe of the Soviet state and his</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.169" end="00:18:31.169" style="s2">Incredibly astute</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:34.829" style="s2">Documentation of the role that the utopian</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.740" end="00:18:37.419" style="s2">political and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.419" end="00:18:44.219" style="s2">Assumptions of Marxism played in creating the system right? It wasn&#39;t an aberration. It was a direct logical consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.860" end="00:18:52.829" style="s2">Collectivist viewpoint and to document all that but also to tell endless stories about people who were able at least to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.260" end="00:18:54.490" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.490" end="00:18:56.849" style="s2">not become corrupted even under</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.460" end="00:19:04.529" style="s2">Unbelievably horrific conditions, you know, and that&#39;s something you also get out of Victor. Frankel&#39;s book man&#39;s search for meaning you know on it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.049" end="00:19:06.909" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.909" end="00:19:13.559" style="s2">The the Gulag Archipelago is a story about horror in some sense, but it&#39;s more a story of the triumph</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.380" end="00:19:17.670" style="s2">The fundamental triumph of the human spirit and perhaps no more</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:24.809" style="s2">Perhaps most evident in the case of Solzhenitsyn himself because he</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:30.329" style="s2">Memorized this book in some sense while he was in the camps and then wrote it under extreme duress</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.730" end="00:19:36.329" style="s2">Afterwards and it&#39;s an immense undertaking and it&#39;s unbelievably emotionally intense the entire book</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.330" end="00:19:40.590" style="s2">It&#39;s like one, you know seventeen hundred page scream of outrage</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.590" end="00:19:44.340" style="s2">Did he just can hardly believe that someone can write at that white-hot?</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:49.830" style="s2">Intensity for such a long period of time and you know, his book had an unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.370" end="00:19:58.259" style="s2">Global impact, I think it sold 30 million copies and it definitely for at least a reasonable period of time</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:01.110" style="s2">made it completely untenable for</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.620" end="00:20:07.979" style="s2">Utopian resentful utopian intellectuals to ethically justify their</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.260" end="00:20:16.170" style="s2">Radical leftist collectivism it just blew the slats out from underneath any ethical credibility that communism</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.570" end="00:20:23.340" style="s2">That that remained of the Communist doctrine by the 1970s and that that&#39;s a hell of a thing for someone to manage on their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.890" end="00:20:25.890" style="s2">It&#39;s a pretty big task</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.790" end="00:20:30.360" style="s2">So while you were going through that I was thinking myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.360" end="00:20:32.819" style="s2">So I was talking to I still talk to</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.040" end="00:20:38.399" style="s2">Military folks and I was talking to some military leaders the young leader</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:45.990" style="s2">So like platoon level and company level leaders. So these are guys that are in charge of you know, 40 guys or maybe 150 guys</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.950" end="00:20:54.809" style="s2">And and you know you can have some real ethical problems and and one of the things that I said to this group was I</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.510" end="00:20:57.160" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.160" end="00:20:59.399" style="s2">Hey in your in your platoon</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.020" end="00:21:07.860" style="s2">You&#39;ve got a murderer in your platoon. You&#39;ve got someone in your platoon that as a sadist and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.010" end="00:21:11.010" style="s2">They were kind of looking at me</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.610" end="00:21:17.639" style="s2">Suspect, you know a little bit like oh, come on now, come on. What are you talking about?</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.400" end="00:21:21.450" style="s2">How big is the platoon a platoon is forty guys? Oh, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.450" end="00:21:21.780" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.780" end="00:21:26.160" style="s2">and he&#39;s got someone in there like that and I was I was actually gonna ask you how accurate I was and then I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.160" end="00:21:29.009" style="s2">Gonna actually say that no matter what you say how accurate is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.409" end="00:21:34.739" style="s2">Even if it was even if it wasn&#39;t one out of every thousand you have to act as a leader as if in your platoon</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.740" end="00:21:39.929" style="s2">You&#39;ve got one of those guys. That&#39;s the way you need to well you look and there&#39;s another book</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.299" end="00:21:43.319" style="s2">Mmm called The Rape of Nanking we&#39;ve covered that. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.320" end="00:21:43.720" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.720" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">so one of the things that was really horrifying about that book is so imagine that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.940" end="00:21:55.590" style="s2">Maybe let&#39;s say that there&#39;s one in a hundred just for the sake of argument that&#39;s really got cruel and psychopathic traits</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.590" end="00:21:59.130" style="s2">What do you think professionally? What do you think? That number is? Oh, I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.799" end="00:22:05.459" style="s2">1% isn&#39;t unreasonable. It could be higher than that. I mean it there&#39;s gradations. Right? Right. Yeah, there&#39;s probably a group of 40 people</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.460" end="00:22:07.460" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be one guy in there whose</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.530" end="00:22:13.079" style="s2">Proclivity in that direction is sufficiently strong so that you better keep an eye on them</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.080" end="00:22:17.069" style="s2">That&#39;s for sure and this is a group of people that joined the military, right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.070" end="00:22:20.460" style="s2">So they&#39;re already you know, you&#39;ve already gotten you&#39;ve already got a group. That&#39;s ok with</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.010" end="00:22:25.349" style="s2">With theoretically having to kill other people, right? So this is probably you know, so if it&#39;s 100</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.710" end="00:22:32.280" style="s2">That&#39;s likely an underestimate. So I think your estimate is perfectly reasonable and it might be conservative</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.650" end="00:22:40.049" style="s2">what happened in Nanking was that the most sadistic people became the targets of imitation and emulation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.450" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">That&#39;s when things really get out of hand. Yeah, right</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">so and that&#39;s the same thing with Emil I massacre and and that was so when I was talking this group and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.669" end="00:22:53.399" style="s2">I&#39;m getting and I said to him I said you&#39;re looking at me like right now like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.400" end="00:22:55.400" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about like I&#39;m crazy. Mmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.780" end="00:22:58.889" style="s2">Who knows about the meal I mascar and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.890" end="00:23:01.739" style="s2">All of a sudden it got quiet because if you know anything about the meal I&#39;m asked her</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.740" end="00:23:04.829" style="s2">It was a normal group of guys. It was a normal</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.830" end="00:23:10.860" style="s2">Group of guys there&#39;s a normal company of American soldiers and you know what? They&#39;ve been through some stress. Mmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.890" end="00:23:14.039" style="s2">They&#39;ve been through you know, they&#39;d had their friends killed and it was in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.039" end="00:23:16.030" style="s2">there was no one really to react against or to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.030" end="00:23:20.369" style="s2">Take your aggression out on because the enemy you couldn&#39;t see him. They would hide and it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:24.929" style="s2">But then they turned and they snapped and the same thing you had the leader</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.090" end="00:23:29.010" style="s2">A guy named lieutenant Calley who was the platoon leader who?</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:33.839" style="s2">I&#39;d love for you to do a psychological profile. Maybe you he&#39;s one of these guys. It was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.780" end="00:23:41.160" style="s2">It was it totally insecure about everything right? And so he got those shoulder boards on which is the way the way sultanate</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.160" end="00:23:44.759" style="s2">Yeah, right, right his his experience beautiful tune leader</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.760" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:47.579" style="s2">And what it did to him and he goes through that this boy</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.950" end="00:23:52.710" style="s2">Fantastic to hear when he talks about what he did. He know he was looking back saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.710" end="00:23:58.199" style="s2">Oh, I did this and I didn&#39;t listen to this little rampage of things that he how he acted as a commander</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.200" end="00:23:58.440" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.440" end="00:24:02.729" style="s2">I ate the food the good food right in front of my guys when they weren&#39;t good in for I was getting the good food</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.730" end="00:24:08.219" style="s2">And he took advantage of all the little all the little comforts that you got being in an officer. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.220" end="00:24:12.270" style="s2">Well, what yeah, well, he was trying in the in the whole book and especially in that section</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.270" end="00:24:18.389" style="s2">Which I think is in vol ii which I think is the greatest of the three volumes, especially the last half of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.390" end="00:24:20.390" style="s2">Which is just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.680" end="00:24:24.029" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s genius level right income</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.000" end="00:24:27.180" style="s2">Unbelievably compelling and brilliant and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.180" end="00:24:31.229" style="s2">I mean he he said that when he was in the camps that one of the things that he did</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:35.339" style="s2">Especially once he started to identify people that he truly admired</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.800" end="00:24:39.810" style="s2">was to go over his life with a fine-tooth comb and try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.020" end="00:24:44.879" style="s2">Try to remember everything that he did wrong by his own</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.070" end="00:24:51.540" style="s2">Estimation and then try to set it right in some manner and so there was a that&#39;s a repentance and then a redemption right?</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.540" end="00:24:56.639" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s a real there&#39;s a real fundamental like a medieval christian undertone to all of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:00.930" style="s2">But it what one of the things that&#39;s quite interesting. Is that when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.990" end="00:25:08.729" style="s2">issues that are this serious you&#39;re almost inevitably in a situation where you&#39;re going to find yourself compelled to use</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.950" end="00:25:10.950" style="s2">some kind of quasi religious language</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.350" end="00:25:17.790" style="s2">because you end up discussing good and evil and issues of redemption and issues of repentance and issues of conscience and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.920" end="00:25:23.399" style="s2">Sin, and all of that there isn&#39;t language that&#39;s deep enough to get at it. Otherwise and what Solzhenitsyn did was</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.310" end="00:25:27.599" style="s2">Scour his conscience and try to put himself together</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.150" end="00:25:33.119" style="s2">Partly because he was shamed he was ashamed of himself in the face of these extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.820" end="00:25:38.700" style="s2">extraordinary people who seemed to be able to keep their moral compass under circumstances where</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.070" end="00:25:42.750" style="s2">No one should ever assume that they would keep their moral compass</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.150" end="00:25:48.239" style="s2">Because certainly like I said when I was reading this the Gulag and other books like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:50.670" style="s2">I never assumed that if I was in those</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.830" end="00:25:56.040" style="s2">Situations that I would have been one of the people who kept their head and we&#39;re able to withstand</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.370" end="00:26:00.270" style="s2">the temptation to become a trustee for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.270" end="00:26:02.849" style="s2">And to take things the easy way and to lord it over the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.220" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">Prisoners and to and to adopt that position of authority, you know, it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a head slave among slaves</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.280" end="00:26:09.970" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.970" end="00:26:15.750" style="s2">You know you could say well better to be the head slave than to be the bottom slave and well that&#39;s true in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.750" end="00:26:19.560" style="s2">With regards to creature comfort but as Solzhenitsyn point out points out</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.560" end="00:26:23.669" style="s2">it might be a little bit hard on your soul and that actually turns out to be something of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.430" end="00:26:28.709" style="s2">crucial not only crucial importance psychologically, but crucial importance</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.650" end="00:26:36.719" style="s2">sociologically and politically because if you sacrifice that then you warp the structure around you which is exactly what happened in in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.090" end="00:26:42.630" style="s2">Establishment of these camps, you know in the the soviet union was just one big lie</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.700" end="00:26:48.059" style="s2">What was their old joke, they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.760" end="00:26:51.690" style="s2">the whole the whole book and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.210" end="00:26:54.780" style="s2">The whole soviet union when you when you read about it now</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.820" end="00:26:59.580" style="s2">It seems like it&#39;s it it seems like a bad joy, it seems like a bad movie</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.580" end="00:27:01.619" style="s2">You couldn&#39;t move with just the way the way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.650" end="00:27:07.769" style="s2">Stalin would do something and in the way that that order were coming out it seems like one of those cheesy. Um,</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.810" end="00:27:13.379" style="s2">You know comedic movies about these decisions that they&#39;re making and yeah, it&#39;s surreal</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.380" end="00:27:15.630" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s completely it&#39;s completely insane</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.850" end="00:27:23.370" style="s2">You know at one point he&#39;s talking about the there was a new penalty for when they call it clipping corn or or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.370" end="00:27:31.109" style="s2">They&#39;re basically a twelve-year-old kid would be starving and go into a field. Yeah and clip a cure of a corn an ear of corn</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.200" end="00:27:35.249" style="s2">Yeah that happened in the Ukraine during the decolonization, right?</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.250" end="00:27:39.690" style="s2">It was against the law to go out after the fields were were harvested</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.859" style="s2">It was against the law to go out and pick grain off the ground to feed your family</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.260" end="00:27:48.749" style="s2">Right and the prison sentence was like a tenner which is there a little word for ten years</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.750" end="00:27:53.609" style="s2">so you&#39;re gonna get you you steal a piece of corn or you pick up corn off the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.130" end="00:27:57.270" style="s2">You&#39;re getting ten years. Yeah, you can&#39;t comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.090" end="00:28:03.030" style="s2">That that is very hard to machine that yeah work. Yeah, and they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.550" end="00:28:09.819" style="s2">They you know, he&#39;d in the earlier parts of the book when he start going through the trials that they were doing on people. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.760" end="00:28:11.780" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.780" end="00:28:14.709" style="s2">Completely crazy I can grind Kalka. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.780" end="00:28:19.989" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s why I hate to see the kangaroo courts emerging all over all over the West you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.990" end="00:28:22.660" style="s2">And and and with the university sort of at the forefront of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.850" end="00:28:29.170" style="s2">so we&#39;re building these alternative court systems constantly that don&#39;t follow standard legal procedure and it&#39;s really I</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:36.189" style="s2">Mean we&#39;re messing with things that that we shouldn&#39;t be messing with and yeah the whole that I mean there are there are accounts</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:38.190" style="s2">I believe it&#39;s in the gulag of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.170" end="00:28:41.289" style="s2">Applause after ass tell in a speech</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.900" end="00:28:49.119" style="s2">right where people would stand up and applaud and and they and they&#39;d applaud until until literally the old people were falling over because if</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:54.370" style="s2">You were the first person to stop applauding then you were well, it was off to the camps with you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.370" end="00:29:01.599" style="s2">He absolutely outlines it. So that&#39;s that sounds so crazy to say and he outlines a specific thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:06.939" style="s2">It&#39;s that right there these no one will stop applauding him because they&#39;re afraid they&#39;re gonna get ratted out</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.940" end="00:29:12.730" style="s2">you know, I there but by everyone else, yeah, well been manned by the people who are in fact watching and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.730" end="00:29:19.569" style="s2">you know what by the end by the by the collapse of East Germany one third of the people were in for</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.790" end="00:29:22.929" style="s2">informers for the state and so if you had a family of six people</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.809" end="00:29:27.819" style="s2">Two of your family members were direct government informers, you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.820" end="00:29:33.939" style="s2">And it&#39;s it&#39;s so it&#39;s it&#39;s creepy in some sense and it&#39;s a very weak word to use in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.070" end="00:29:40.360" style="s2">But okay when I was at New York University talking to Jonathan hight about I don&#39;t know it was about a few months ago</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.940" end="00:29:45.010" style="s2">he just wrote that book called the coddling of the American mind, you know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.770" end="00:29:50.349" style="s2">He took me into one of the men&#39;s washrooms there and there&#39;s a poster on the wall</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.170" end="00:29:53.769" style="s2">asking students to turn each other in for</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.590" end="00:30:01.059" style="s2">instances of bias or offensive speech and they have a whole bureaucracy that&#39;s designed to do nothing else, but</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.600" end="00:30:09.219" style="s2">Adjudicate these instances of biased speech and these posters are up on the walls as if this is something to be proud of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.500" end="00:30:15.250" style="s2">You know and the same thing is happening now in Scotland where the Scottish police are doing exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.250" end="00:30:19.839" style="s2">They&#39;re asking citizens to turn each other in for for hate crimes, you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:24.310" style="s2">and the problem with that is the fundamental problem with that and the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.010" end="00:30:31.510" style="s2">Unsolvable problem is well who defines hate and and and where&#39;s where&#39;s the line drawn?</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.510" end="00:30:37.359" style="s2">It&#39;s like well anything that upsets me that you say is hate that and then it&#39;s worse than that. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.120" end="00:30:42.430" style="s2">What happens is the people who define hate end up being those who are looking?</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.040" end="00:30:49.629" style="s2">To take offense so that they can find someone they can define as a victimizer so that they can persecute them</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.180" end="00:30:51.320" style="s2">morally and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.320" end="00:30:58.210" style="s2">justify that inner sadism and those are the people who end up defining the laws and then they mask this with the morality saying while</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.210" end="00:31:00.909" style="s2">We&#39;re doing this to make our society a safe place. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.430" end="00:31:08.830" style="s2">Absolutely. It&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely dreadful and to see that happening in the UK was just it&#39;s just awful because I mean, you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.830" end="00:31:14.139" style="s2">The UK is a centre Assent the center point of the idea of free speech</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.140" end="00:31:16.040" style="s2">I mean a lot of America</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.040" end="00:31:22.450" style="s2">Obviously a lot of American ideals America is a great center of free speech but I mean it&#39;s a variation on the English system</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.670" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">So to see that happening in the UK is just it&#39;s awful and to see the police doing this and being you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.810" end="00:31:36.940" style="s2">Encouraged by the politicians and and and and to see this put forward as some sort of moral action. It&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.120" end="00:31:44.200" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s an echo of this kind of catastrophe that that we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.010" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">So I think about that sometimes and I also have a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.400" end="00:31:57.129" style="s2">Look at things and let not be too worried about it. Like hey, come on. Yeah, what&#39;s really good?</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.160" end="00:31:57.370" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.370" end="00:31:57.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.640" end="00:32:01.420" style="s2">And that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s actually part of my personality and part of that comes from my old job. Where</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.490" end="00:32:05.380" style="s2">Hey, I can&#39;t worry about these little things. Oh, there&#39;s some little problem going over there</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.450" end="00:32:09.429" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s not gonna be that&#39;s not gonna fact us it&#39;s not gonna and you got to pay attention a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.430" end="00:32:10.700" style="s2">Make sure it doesn&#39;t get out of hand</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.700" end="00:32:16.600" style="s2">But that thing about speech and and you just mentioned the the kulak that sorry still lacks. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.240" end="00:32:21.430" style="s2">They were the Ukrainian. They were the Ukrainian farmers who were good at farming when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.100" end="00:32:28.659" style="s2">Read this part it got me worried about my own personal laksa days ago attitude</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:31.090" style="s2">Towards things that I think all that&#39;s not a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.090" end="00:32:34.859" style="s2">let me let me read this little section about the about the escalation of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.500" end="00:32:38.670" style="s2">Word kulak. Yeah, and and where it started and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.460" end="00:32:42.420" style="s2">We&#39;re dead. Yeah, that&#39;s good. So here we go</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.050" end="00:32:47.699" style="s2">In Russian a Kulak is a miserly</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.309" end="00:32:53.009" style="s2">dishonest rural trader who grows rich not by his own labour, but through someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.030" end="00:32:56.050" style="s2">In</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.050" end="00:32:59.849" style="s2">Every locality even before the Revolution such cruel acts could be numbered on</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.190" end="00:33:05.070" style="s2">One&#39;s fingers and the revolution totally destroyed their basis of activity</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.740" end="00:33:10.679" style="s2">Subsequently after 1917 by a transfer of meaning the name kulak</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.530" end="00:33:17.399" style="s2">Began to be applied to all those who in any way hired workers</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.830" end="00:33:25.290" style="s2">even if it was owned Eve, even if it was only when they were temporarily short of working hands in their own families, but</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.890" end="00:33:33.119" style="s2">And that doesn&#39;t stop there the inflation of this scathingly term of this scathing term cuckoo lock</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.700" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">proceeded relentlessly and by 1930 all</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.000" end="00:33:41.819" style="s2">strong peasants in general who were being so-called all peasants</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.160" end="00:33:46.889" style="s2">strong and management strong in work or even strong merely in convictions</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.900" end="00:33:54.569" style="s2">the term Kulak was used to smash the strength of the peasantry and I gotta I gotta go a little bit further because</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.240" end="00:33:58.199" style="s2">Hell of a thing for the Workers Party to do ain&#39;t crazy</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.200" end="00:33:58.900" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.900" end="00:34:00.309" style="s2">They went further though</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.309" end="00:34:07.859" style="s2">Beyond this in every village there were people who in one way or another had personally gotten in the way of the local activists</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.250" end="00:34:13.800" style="s2">This was the perfect time to settle accounts with them of jealousy envy and insult</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.800" end="00:34:21.719" style="s2">These are the people you were just talking about a new word was needed for these new victims as a class and it was born</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.179" end="00:34:24.359" style="s2">By this time it had no social or economic</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.909" end="00:34:27.628" style="s2">Content whatsoever, but it had a marvelous sound</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.840" end="00:34:30.840" style="s2">pod kulaks, Nick and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.389" end="00:34:35.909" style="s2">That meant a person aiding the kulaks in other words. I</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.429" end="00:34:38.849" style="s2">Consider you an accomplice of the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.480" end="00:34:45.530" style="s2">Yeah, and that&#39;s all it took. Yeah. Well one of the things I tried to outline in my forward to the abridged version</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:49.400" style="s2">was I was thinking about this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.730" end="00:34:52.350" style="s2">oddly enough about</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.350" end="00:34:55.309" style="s2">Intersectionality, which is uh, like social justice idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.310" end="00:35:00.920" style="s2">you know that the social justice idea is that we&#39;re best defined by our collective identity and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.710" end="00:35:06.650" style="s2">The proper narrative in relationship to our collective identity is one of victim victimizer</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.650" end="00:35:12.650" style="s2">Which is a replay of the old Marxist doctrine of bourgeois z and proletariat. It&#39;s just in its new guys</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.320" end="00:35:19.279" style="s2">I mean and that new guys developed at least in part in response to the Gulag Archipelago because the old</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.650" end="00:35:22.729" style="s2">proletariat bourgeoisie distinction became morally untenable</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.730" end="00:35:28.340" style="s2">so it just went underground and underwent this transformation the intersectional theorists point out that your</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.070" end="00:35:36.199" style="s2">Status as a victimizer or a victim is actually the intersection of your multiple identities. And so and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:41.660" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the Achilles heel of the collectivist notion and we can get into why that is but</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.850" end="00:35:46.819" style="s2">There&#39;s a horror that goes along with that that people that&#39;s that&#39;s not obvious that I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:52.219" style="s2">contributed to exactly why the Russian Revolution went so horribly wrong and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.950" end="00:35:58.130" style="s2">So imagine that I could characterize you along five or six different dimensions of group identity</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.200" end="00:36:03.950" style="s2">It&#39;s pretty easy and while your mail your mail of a certain age your mail of a certain age and economic class</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.290" end="00:36:07.640" style="s2">Your you have a certain sexual orientation. You have a certain ethnicity</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.310" end="00:36:15.499" style="s2">You have a certain race that&#39;s six groups right there, and we could continue, you know, your parents had a certain socio-economic class</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.500" end="00:36:21.380" style="s2">and so did your grandparents and and then your ethnic group had a certain privilege or lack thereof and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.510" end="00:36:25.370" style="s2">Attractive or you&#39;re not attractive and you&#39;re intelligent or you&#39;re not intelligent and there&#39;s templeman</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.590" end="00:36:30.979" style="s2">Temperamental variability like there&#39;s all sorts of ways of characterizing you according to your group. Okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.980" end="00:36:32.980" style="s2">Now we might say that if we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.180" end="00:36:40.939" style="s2">Compassionate people that we would take one of those group identities or more and look at where your dispossessed and victimized</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.310" end="00:36:41.810" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.810" end="00:36:48.410" style="s2">And we&#39;re gonna find some dimension along which you&#39;re less privileged than some people like maybe you come from a working-class background</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.780" end="00:36:53.719" style="s2">Despite the fact that you&#39;re like a straight male and so you can be a victim on that dimension</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.720" end="00:36:57.500" style="s2">And so and that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.230" end="00:37:03.830" style="s2">An element of intersectional theory right? And that may be your your your</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.440" end="00:37:06.440" style="s2">oppression is the product of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.320" end="00:37:10.159" style="s2">your multiple victim like identities</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.290" end="00:37:17.479" style="s2">But that can easily be reversed because it&#39;s absolutely the case that I can take any person and I can do add</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.270" end="00:37:24.709" style="s2">Multi-dimensional analysis of their group identities and I can find at least one dimension along which they&#39;re the perpetrator not the victim</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.830" end="00:37:27.019" style="s2">They&#39;re the victimizer not the victim</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.020" end="00:37:31.999" style="s2">and as soon as I can identify a dimension along which they&#39;re a victimizer then that justifies their</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.190" end="00:37:37.940" style="s2">Persecution and so one of the things that you saw happening in the Russian Revolution and it&#39;s very much akin to what you just described</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.940" end="00:37:39.950" style="s2">was that the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.310" end="00:37:43.310" style="s2">borders of who</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:46.970" style="s2">Who was validly accused of being a victimizer?</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.090" end="00:37:54.139" style="s2">Essentially expanded to include everyone and and that&#39;s actually right in it&#39;s it&#39;s in a perverse sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.210" end="00:38:01.310" style="s2">It&#39;s right because if you position yourself properly in in the historical flow</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.310" end="00:38:06.259" style="s2">Then you should see yourself as a perpetrator and a victim equally. Well, it&#39;s not the right way to see yourself at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.260" end="00:38:09.020" style="s2">but if you&#39;re gonna play that game you&#39;re gonna be on both sides of it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.090" end="00:38:16.159" style="s2">Then that issue is and this is related to your idea about you know in your platoon. You&#39;ve got one person who&#39;s sadistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.290" end="00:38:18.290" style="s2">It&#39;s like, okay well</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.330" end="00:38:26.029" style="s2">let&#39;s even assume that at the beginning of the Russian Revolution that the vast majority of the people who were motivated by communism were actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.700" end="00:38:34.669" style="s2">Compassionate with regards to the dispossessed peasantry now. I don&#39;t believe that but we could say that that was even a significant minority</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.340" end="00:38:39.139" style="s2">Well, the question is did you just say on it? Mmm-hmm. What was your what was your</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.960" end="00:38:42.050" style="s2">Hypothetical percentage. Well, well, let&#39;s say well</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.050" end="00:38:49.999" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s 20% or let&#39;s even say it&#39;s 50% of people who are genuinely motivated by compassion for the dispossessed, but then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.910" end="00:38:52.260" style="s2">minority</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.260" end="00:38:56.810" style="s2">Maybe we could even say it was only 10% to begin with who weren&#39;t motivated by that at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.810" end="00:39:01.519" style="s2">they were motivated by the jealousy and the spite and the and and the resentment that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.800" end="00:39:06.350" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn describes and they were the ones who were after those to be persecuted</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.860" end="00:39:14.089" style="s2">The thing is they got the upper-hand really rapidly and it might be because the carnivorous types the predatory types are</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.280" end="00:39:18.860" style="s2">Much more dangerous and powerful than the compassionate types. Like they&#39;ll take them out instantly</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.860" end="00:39:24.650" style="s2">We&#39;re we&#39;re willing to step up and smash someone. Yes, most of the people that are saying. Oh, we just want to help</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.920" end="00:39:31.219" style="s2">Yes, exactly. Well and there&#39;s someone I actually cited a guy named. I think his name was Walter Lots us in the foreword</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.220" end="00:39:36.800" style="s2">Who who wrote wrote in a journal called Red Terror that if you were interrogating an enemy of the state?</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.140" end="00:39:42.739" style="s2">You didn&#39;t bother with niceties like their individual guilt. That was a burrs huazi</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.220" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">Conceit and that&#39;s that&#39;s a really important thing to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.160" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">What you wanted to do is to do a class-based analysis and find out well</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:55.579" style="s2">Are they a member of let&#39;s say the Kulak or the affiliates of the kulaks</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.580" end="00:40:00.440" style="s2">which is a lovely way of expanding your list of potential victims and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.780" end="00:40:05.180" style="s2">Execute accordingly and that would mean well the person that you&#39;re interrogating</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:10.700" style="s2">right or the class member that you&#39;re interrogating and then their children and perhaps also their grandchildren and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.890" end="00:40:14.539" style="s2">Latsis himself was eventually executed by the Stellan as somebody wrote to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.610" end="00:40:19.190" style="s2">after I wrote the foreword and told me that that was his eventual fate and I thought well talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.380" end="00:40:25.369" style="s2">Standing on a chair and putting the noose around your own neck and kicking it out from underneath you it&#39;s like, you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.370" end="00:40:27.370" style="s2">He basically he murdered himself</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.110" end="00:40:30.709" style="s2">Fundamentally and and you know, you could say in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.710" end="00:40:37.640" style="s2">That was the story of the Soviet Union to it to a tremendous degree. Yeah, there&#39;s one part going back to the the ever-expanding</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.120" end="00:40:41.120" style="s2">people that need to be destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.130" end="00:40:48.739" style="s2">There&#39;s a point in the book where he starts he&#39;s saying. Hey, look there&#39;s insects Stalin&#39;s just described or maybe was Lenin was describing these</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.070" end="00:40:55.400" style="s2">Certain people as insects. You don&#39;t need to be destroyed and then he just that that just starts off with</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.400" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">Hey people that are rabble rousers</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.470" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">Yeah, they&#39;re insects and and then it just expands and expands and it&#39;s got priests and then it&#39;s got engineers</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:09.049" style="s2">Oh, yeah and physicians and physicians everyone in wreckers. Yeah records</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.050" end="00:41:13.430" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s the word that they use there that he uses in the book for first basically saboteurs</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.430" end="00:41:16.789" style="s2">Yeah, and that expands beyond comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.860" end="00:41:23.039" style="s2">Yeah, because at every scene problem that there is is the fault of some person out there that sabotage</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:26.459" style="s2">Yeah, and and they they do this show trial and he talks about in the book</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.220" end="00:41:33.270" style="s2">For I think that I think the phrase that he uses or that they use at the Russian that the Soviets used was</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.330" end="00:41:41.219" style="s2">Organizers of the famine huh meaning like oh, yeah, you&#39;re starving and these people over here</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.290" end="00:41:44.429" style="s2">They&#39;re the reason you&#39;re these are the people that organized the famine</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.430" end="00:41:47.669" style="s2">They&#39;re the Wreckers of production of food, and you bet you bet</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.670" end="00:41:52.530" style="s2">well, it was either that you know, you imagine that you you you adopt a worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.140" end="00:41:55.140" style="s2">that worldview</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.150" end="00:42:01.260" style="s2">enables you to at least in principle organize yourself with other people and to provide you with a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.570" end="00:42:09.029" style="s2">Psychological stability and then things go dreadfully wrong, and then you have a choice which is to reevaluate your worldview</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.030" end="00:42:15.419" style="s2">which is of course what Solzhenitsyn does in the Gulag Archipelago in a very deep ways reorganize his entire worldview or</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.790" end="00:42:18.479" style="s2">You can look for reasons why you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:25.020" style="s2">And and these things are happening and Solzhenitsyn talks a lot in the Gulag Archipelago about see he had a moral conundrum</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.570" end="00:42:28.769" style="s2">When he was in prison, and he started his moral awakening</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.780" end="00:42:32.879" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and he was trying to figure out how to treat other people who were imprisoned</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.980" end="00:42:39.840" style="s2">He had a real moral conundrum when a committed communist was dragged into the gulag system which happened all the time</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:43.379" style="s2">he said those people were in particularly dire straits because</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.230" end="00:42:46.649" style="s2">Not only had they been subject to the entire</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.170" end="00:42:54.120" style="s2">tyrannical weight of the deceitful state but it was at the hands of their own comrades and friends and then the the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.790" end="00:43:02.249" style="s2">committed communists would enter the gulag and they would still be in there morally superior phase right that that their</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.770" end="00:43:03.700" style="s2">incarceration was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.700" end="00:43:09.270" style="s2">mistake and that things would be set right and that there was nothing wrong with the system and they would attempt to justify it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.730" end="00:43:13.260" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn was never sure how to react to these people</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.260" end="00:43:14.760" style="s2">Ethically because on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.760" end="00:43:15.240" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.240" end="00:43:21.360" style="s2">They were you know devastated because now there were political prisoners and maybe they got a 20-year sentence and they were in terrible</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.430" end="00:43:25.379" style="s2">You know stripped of their family and just ruined but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.380" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">they were still avid supporters of the very fist that had crushed them and so his eventual conclusion was that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.880" end="00:43:41.099" style="s2">until they broke and repented they they weren&#39;t to be allied with they were still essentially on the side of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.410" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">Wall of the perpetrator and it seems to me that that that&#39;s right. That&#39;s that&#39;s unrepentant. Sin. Let&#39;s say and it isn&#39;t until you</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.640" end="00:43:55.829" style="s2">What what would you say until you take responsibility for your own complicit?</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.830" end="00:44:01.259" style="s2">&#39;no sin, you&#39;re in your unfair interrogation that you get to join the ranks of of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.220" end="00:44:06.360" style="s2">Valuable and suffering humanity again, and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.230" end="00:44:15.780" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s that the the extension of the persecution is really something that&#39;s horrifying to see</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.850" end="00:44:17.320" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.320" end="00:44:25.259" style="s2">Who constituted the victimizer the ranks of who constituted victimizer just grew and grew and grew or one of the most shocking groups of?</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.840" end="00:44:28.769" style="s2">People that ended up in the gulags were the damned</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.650" end="00:44:32.730" style="s2">Soviet soldiers then it just got back. Oh, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.360" end="00:44:39.509" style="s2">That&#39;s the thing you can&#39;t make up you can&#39;t make that up a giving Solzhenitsyn who who was</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.090" end="00:44:43.529" style="s2">like in close combat with the enemy and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.080" end="00:44:49.890" style="s2">He wrote a letter to one of his buddies and said yeah, this doesn&#39;t seem like to be a great decision by Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.890" end="00:44:53.189" style="s2">Yeah, and next thing, you know, he&#39;s he&#39;s in yeah and prison. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.190" end="00:44:58.530" style="s2">Well, the stellen stellen decided that yeah, this is something that you you you can&#39;t you can&#39;t believe this</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.530" end="00:45:04.530" style="s2">Well it is there is this like it&#39;s like, you know, if there&#39;s something satanic at the bottom of this, you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.050" end="00:45:10.590" style="s2">Mythologically speaking. There&#39;s also something that&#39;s like a cosmic. It&#39;s like cosmic black humor</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.590" end="00:45:16.259" style="s2">It&#39;s like the the sign on auswitch that said work will set you free, you know, and that&#39;s a joke, right?</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.300" end="00:45:24.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole it&#39;s a terrible terrible dark joke and so much of this has the element of of exactly that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.730" end="00:45:29.010" style="s2">Surreal, I hate to say humor, but it&#39;s it&#39;s right. I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:32.190" style="s2">Stalin decided that the okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.190" end="00:45:38.760" style="s2">So the Soviet prisoners of war were not covered by the Geneva Convention for the treatment of prisoners of war castellan</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.980" end="00:45:40.690" style="s2">refused to sign that agreement</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.690" end="00:45:44.429" style="s2">So like if you were an allied prisoner of the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.430" end="00:45:49.319" style="s2">It wasn&#39;t like you were having a great time it like food was in short supply and you were treated pretty brutally</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.539" end="00:45:52.768" style="s2">But the Soviets were kept separately and they were doing so badly</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.900" end="00:46:00.239" style="s2">That the Allies used to throw food packets over the fence when that was an option. So the Soviet prisoners of war were treated absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.939" end="00:46:04.859" style="s2">dreadfully and and now and Stellan didn&#39;t care about that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.949" end="00:46:09.899" style="s2">then when they were released and went back to the Soviet Union his</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.390" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">dictum was that because they had been exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.859" end="00:46:19.348" style="s2">capitalist West or even the Nazi West for that matter that they had now been</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.229" end="00:46:24.928" style="s2">Intolerably corrupted on ideological grounds and had to be put in the prison camps</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.929" end="00:46:30.599" style="s2">So that was the that was your destiny as you know, I mean, first of all you were a frontline Russian soldier</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.599" end="00:46:32.549" style="s2">Which was just brutal beyond belief</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.549" end="00:46:38.998" style="s2">Their army was completely unprepared for Hitler&#39;s invasion because Stalin trusted Hitler in in his strange way</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.999" end="00:46:43.948" style="s2">And so they were completely unprepared and of course then fighting in the Soviet Union with its winters</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.949" end="00:46:50.789" style="s2">I mean you just you just can&#39;t imagine what that must have been like and then to be thrown in a prisoner of war camp</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.549" end="00:46:55.738" style="s2">at the bottom of the rung and then to be brought back to your country and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.989" end="00:47:03.928" style="s2">Then to be imprisoned as a traitor because as a class you&#39;d been exposed to the wrong ideology. It&#39;s like you just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.539" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:07.449" style="s2">unimaginably</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.449" end="00:47:13.379" style="s2">Vile and surreal at the same time and it is shake your head for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.689" end="00:47:17.668" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s such a shock to read the Gulag Archipelago it you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:25.109" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s like it is it&#39;s like Dante&#39;s Inferno it&#39;s like a trip into hell, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:28.978" style="s2">Yeah, and I guess your that&#39;s what I was trying to say when we started this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.079" end="00:47:31.349" style="s2">I was trying to say that it&#39;s like you&#39;re watching this</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.869" end="00:47:33.869" style="s2">Like like you said, it&#39;s like a bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.029" end="00:47:38.819" style="s2">Comedy movie and you&#39;d think well, that&#39;s that&#39;d be really that way you&#39;d think you know when you take a comedy</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.819" end="00:47:39.029" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.029" end="00:47:42.178" style="s2">One of the things one of the ways you can make people laugh is to take something ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.489" end="00:47:46.829" style="s2">And maybe make it much more extreme in the more extreme. You make it the more funny it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.219" end="00:47:51.629" style="s2">That&#39;s what like happened here. You&#39;re looking at this thing going. Hey</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.630" end="00:47:52.479" style="s2">Oh, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.479" end="00:47:59.399" style="s2">They seem to be trying to make this funny because who in could ever conceive that you could take your frontline soldiers. Who were</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.630" end="00:48:04.970" style="s2">Captured and in misery and when they return home instead of treating them like heroes</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.180" end="00:48:08.869" style="s2">Instead you put them back into a prison the worse one</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.870" end="00:48:14.029" style="s2">Even you can&#39;t even you can&#39;t even that&#39;s just that&#39;s no no, you can&#39;t make this stuff up can&#39;t make it up</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.030" end="00:48:18.620" style="s2">No, did you see I believe that movie was the death of Stalin. Did you I did not</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.620" end="00:48:18.980" style="s2">Oh, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.980" end="00:48:25.699" style="s2">but that&#39;s worth seeing because it&#39;s it&#39;s very interesting because one of the things about that movie is that it captures that</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.950" end="00:48:29.299" style="s2">surreal element because it&#39;s a black comedy, you know, and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.300" end="00:48:38.180" style="s2">There are comical things happening in the movie in that terrible dark way constantly at the same time that in the background</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.700" end="00:48:41.750" style="s2">Genuinely, terrible things are happening. So it&#39;s that horrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.560" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">It&#39;s that it&#39;s it&#39;s got that horrible satirical flavor that runs through books like The Gulag Archipelago where you think well</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:54.379" style="s2">There&#39;s just no this is so absurd that there&#39;s no possible way</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.380" end="00:48:58.940" style="s2">It could have occurred and yet that&#39;s not only did it happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.430" end="00:49:06.589" style="s2">There was like a contest to top the absurdity, you know to to to consider the engineers for example Wreckers is well</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.590" end="00:49:12.019" style="s2">These people were building the Soviet system to the degree that it was built and then to turn around and accuse</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.150" end="00:49:12.650" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.650" end="00:49:20.509" style="s2">Those people of being the ones who destroy and undermine it it&#39;s it&#39;s part of I really think that what&#39;s what underlies this</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.150" end="00:49:27.319" style="s2">whatever this is and I think this is what manifests itself in the worst of the leftist collectivism is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.660" end="00:49:31.639" style="s2">A real hatred for anything that smacks of competence at all</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:37.609" style="s2">Like I I tried to imagine those Russian villages because that come from a small town a small northern town, too</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.610" end="00:49:42.380" style="s2">so I kind of I tried to imagine so imagine that you&#39;re in an isolated village and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:46.789" style="s2">It&#39;s a peasant village and the peasants weren&#39;t freed that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.790" end="00:49:53.120" style="s2">Right, they were basically serfs until until about the the middle of the second half of the nineteenth century</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.450" end="00:49:56.990" style="s2">and so they had been emancipated and then some of those people who were</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.240" end="00:49:59.959" style="s2">Emancipated got a little bit of land and started to have a life</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.960" end="00:50:05.899" style="s2">you know started to be successful peasants and they were also the people that grew the bulk of the crops because</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.420" end="00:50:11.869" style="s2">What you see happening in any productive domain is that a small percentage of people do almost all the productive work?</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.210" end="00:50:15.960" style="s2">There&#39;s a small percentage of productive farmers who grew all the crops, right?</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.960" end="00:50:20.460" style="s2">And then there&#39;s all sorts of farmers who were only farmers by name and they weren&#39;t successful at all</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.460" end="00:50:27.540" style="s2">So you have and then there is a certain relationship between being productive as a farmer and developing some wealth</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.540" end="00:50:30.749" style="s2">They&#39;ll maybe you had a house and maybe you could hire a person or two, you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.750" end="00:50:34.949" style="s2">And which you think would be actually be a good thing, especially if you were also growing food</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.170" end="00:50:35.670" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.670" end="00:50:39.510" style="s2">So you imagine you you get a village and now there&#39;s a bit of a socio-economic?</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.910" end="00:50:40.410" style="s2">pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.410" end="00:50:46.379" style="s2">And there&#39;s some people that are doing well and they&#39;re really and they&#39;re and it isn&#39;t the crooked people that are really annoying</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.570" end="00:50:53.099" style="s2">Though people who like the genuine cool acts. Let&#39;s say that that small percentage of psychopathic types. Who were basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.430" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">Profiting criminally off the efforts of others. Those aren&#39;t so annoying those people because they&#39;re rich, but they don&#39;t deserve it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:02.909" style="s2">And so they don&#39;t stand</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.310" end="00:51:10.139" style="s2">Towards you as a moral ideal that shames you but the really annoying people are the ones who are doing well and deserve it</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:13.530" style="s2">Especially if you&#39;re someone who&#39;s doing nothing and is bitter</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.690" end="00:51:17.099" style="s2">Okay, so now so there&#39;s the village and you&#39;ve got your people who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.099" end="00:51:21.509" style="s2">All right, and then you&#39;ve got a huge strata of people who aren&#39;t upset about the people who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.510" end="00:51:21.660" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.660" end="00:51:26.639" style="s2">They might even admire them and be happy that they&#39;re around because they&#39;re making the community thrive and growing some food</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.800" end="00:51:28.830" style="s2">then you have this little this little</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.250" end="00:51:34.229" style="s2">Strata at the bottom of people who are near do wells and on the more</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.420" end="00:51:37.260" style="s2">psychopathic end of things and they are bitter and resentful and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.690" end="00:51:44.550" style="s2">Waiting for their bloody opportunity and then the communist intellectuals come into town and say, you know those people that are doing well</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.430" end="00:51:48.810" style="s2">they actually everything they&#39;ve got is ill-gotten and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.060" end="00:51:54.539" style="s2">They stole it and they stole it from you from you like and look at how badly you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.540" end="00:52:00.570" style="s2">And the reason you&#39;re doing badly is because these these people who are lording it over you and who have all this creature comfort</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.570" end="00:52:07.109" style="s2">They they took that from you it&#39;s yours by right and so then all that resentment and jealousy and hatred and rage</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.930" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">Alcohol-fueled as you might well, imagine has this moral</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.369" end="00:52:14.050" style="s2">reason to go with</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.050" end="00:52:19.679" style="s2">pitchforks and and in a mob and surround those houses and to strip them of everything they have and to rape the women and to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:25.470" style="s2">kill the occupants or to ship them off to the middle of Siberia when they&#39;re where they froze to death because there were</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.560" end="00:52:30.120" style="s2">No or died of dysentery or or whatever other plague managed to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.150" end="00:52:38.969" style="s2">Weave its way through these camps and so you have the you have the intellectuals providing the moral rationale for the worst</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.370" end="00:52:45.749" style="s2">Ethical actors in these small villages doing the worst possible things under the guise of compassion, right?</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.750" end="00:52:48.270" style="s2">And that&#39;s part of that victim victimizer narrative</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.270" end="00:52:53.430" style="s2">It&#39;s just an engineering like you could imagine that you can imagine a dark night. You can imagine the winter</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.430" end="00:52:56.129" style="s2">You can imagine the alcohol you can imagine the rage that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.680" end="00:53:01.589" style="s2">Fuels these people who are drinking too much in the pub&#39;s that have been sitting there for the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.860" end="00:53:07.559" style="s2">like what would you say eating up their own Souls with resentment and bitterness and then someone comes in and says</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.660" end="00:53:09.180" style="s2">You&#39;re the true victim here</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.180" end="00:53:13.049" style="s2">and here&#39;s the people that you can go after and then like if you play that on your</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.270" end="00:53:17.430" style="s2">Imagination you get some real sense of exactly what sort of horror that would produce</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.830" end="00:53:21.900" style="s2">you know you think about the rape for example or or just the theft or</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.970" end="00:53:25.290" style="s2">but but it&#39;s the rape that you can really think about us as</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.560" end="00:53:32.100" style="s2">absolute revenge for all that bitter resentment all fueled by the fact that you know,</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.100" end="00:53:40.049" style="s2">you&#39;d sat there for the last twenty years being completely goddamn useless and bitter and and and and angry and and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.330" end="00:53:42.190" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.190" end="00:53:49.290" style="s2">Fantasizing about the day that would come where you&#39;d have your opportunity God and then the whole country and that was the whole country. Oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.840" end="00:53:52.380" style="s2">It was just unbelievable. Yeah, and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.930" end="00:53:58.439" style="s2">He spells that out very clearly and he says it&#39;s you know what he&#39;s saying, you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.440" end="00:54:00.440" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that you got a psychopath in your platoon</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.540" end="00:54:05.729" style="s2">He&#39;s saying that psychopath all that psychopath needs to flip is</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.890" end="00:54:10.799" style="s2">Is the is someone to tell them that that&#39;s the right thing you do and that&#39;s exactly what happened what you said</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:15.689" style="s2">That&#39;s it those guys that were slightly psychopathic. Yeah, and then it becomes okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.720" end="00:54:22.110" style="s2">I&#39;m the on the head psychopath and you&#39;re in my village and you&#39;re let&#39;s say you&#39;re one of those people that are in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.330" end="00:54:27.090" style="s2">Well whose side you&#39;re gonna be on I&#39;m a psychopath if you if you&#39;re not on my side, I&#39;m gonna kill you next</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.360" end="00:54:35.069" style="s2">Yeah, so you go, huh? No, I&#39;m on your side - yeah, and that&#39;s well. It doesn&#39;t tailor kits not like it takes much pressure</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.140" end="00:54:38.619" style="s2">On people to have them fold</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.620" end="00:54:39.050" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.050" end="00:54:45.160" style="s2">Mean one of the things you see you see happening right now in our cultures that&#39;s happening to people all the time with these twitter</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.160" end="00:54:46.180" style="s2">Wars, you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.180" end="00:54:53.650" style="s2">Someone will say something they&#39;ll express an opinion and then they&#39;ll get mobbed by and but only abstractly right</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.650" end="00:54:58.269" style="s2">It&#39;s not like there&#39;s pitchfork wielding mobs at their house, and I&#39;m not making light of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.270" end="00:55:01.989" style="s2">it&#39;s no it&#39;s no pleasant thing to be mobbed on Twitter, but</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.570" end="00:55:07.239" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s an abstraction compared to these people showing up at your house, you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.240" end="00:55:12.969" style="s2">And yeah, and what will happen is that people will go through an abject apology, you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.970" end="00:55:14.440" style="s2">And they&#39;ll say well I really didn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.440" end="00:55:15.020" style="s2">and then now I</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.020" end="00:55:20.499" style="s2">understand what my privilege is and I see how what I said could have been very hurtful to people and you know,</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.500" end="00:55:25.689" style="s2">They they wander through that entire apology and fold almost instantly and and that&#39;s under almost</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.270" end="00:55:29.860" style="s2">almost no pressure compared to what real pressure is and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.530" end="00:55:35.679" style="s2">Real pressure is when the Wolves are actually at your door rather than just barking off in the distance</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:38.080" style="s2">But people will fold just when they&#39;re barking in the distance</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.780" end="00:55:44.560" style="s2">So there&#39;s one lawyer that he talks about in here is the same thing as the DES story the new scribe</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.560" end="00:55:46.719" style="s2">I forget the guys name, but this guy was like the premier</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.600" end="00:55:48.710" style="s2">prosecuting lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.710" end="00:55:54.490" style="s2">For the Soviet government and he just rips people apart over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.490" end="00:55:57.160" style="s2">And as you read about what happens to him sure enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.380" end="00:56:02.169" style="s2">He&#39;s one of the guys that that ended up on the on the defensive and yeah being executed</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.180" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">Yeah, like yeah, I see style they built they built</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.910" end="00:56:14.499" style="s2">a place of butchery and then threw themselves into it, you know, that&#39;s and now and you see</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.500" end="00:56:22.840" style="s2">Social nets and documents this very carefully. I mean Stalin killed all the people who who were foremost actors in the Russian Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.840" end="00:56:30.549" style="s2">Right. So I mean everyone was fed into the great grinding machine, so and and Stalin himself, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.580" end="00:56:33.580" style="s2">it looked to me like</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.190" end="00:56:38.740" style="s2">See, he got himself into something approximating a positive feedback loop, which is a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.260" end="00:56:43.689" style="s2">Thing to have happen and I think Solzhenitsyn does a lovely job of detailing this as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.690" end="00:56:44.870" style="s2">so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.870" end="00:56:51.099" style="s2">imagine that I have a fair amount of contempt for people to begin with and then I find that people are I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.410" end="00:56:53.269" style="s2">trusting person and I find that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.269" end="00:56:58.089" style="s2">Very paranoid about the fact that people are lying to me and then I develop a certain amount of power and a reputation</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.819" end="00:57:03.698" style="s2">Well, then people really do start lying to me all the time in every gesture, you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.699" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">because every time they come near me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:09.099" style="s2">Absolutely terrified and they&#39;re gonna tell me anything that I want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.099" end="00:57:10.939" style="s2">and of course then all that does is</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.939" end="00:57:16.299" style="s2">Validate my view of how pathetic and contemptible everyone is and so and the more that view gets</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:17.140" style="s2">validated the more</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.140" end="00:57:20.289" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s okay to destroy people because look at how pathetic and</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.390" end="00:57:20.890" style="s2">contemptible</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.890" end="00:57:26.920" style="s2">they are how they always lie and all that means is that they lie even more and so this whole thing just spirals out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.920" end="00:57:31.539" style="s2">Control and you know Stalin basically started out as a as the brutal</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.420" end="00:57:40.239" style="s2">Enforcement henchman for henchman for Lenin right the the killer for hire and not like Lenin was above that sort of thing himself</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.549" end="00:57:45.218" style="s2">But but he trained Stalin and and then Stalin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.160" end="00:57:50.139" style="s2">Proclivity to be murderous just kept expanding without limit, right?</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.140" end="00:57:50.589" style="s2">first of all</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.589" end="00:57:54.879" style="s2">It was individuals and then it was groups and then it was nations and then well by the end of his life</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.069" end="00:57:55.569" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.569" end="00:58:00.728" style="s2">What was it the plot to destroy the entire world to to to to?</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.009" end="00:58:06.039" style="s2">to initiate the third world war to wipe out Europe to maybe destroy everything and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:08.049" style="s2">And like there&#39;s no limit</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.049" end="00:58:13.718" style="s2">There was no limit to that, you know and there&#39;s some evidence that that&#39;s perhaps why he was killed, you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.719" end="00:58:18.428" style="s2">Because Stalin himself even went too far for the horrible for the horrible</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.309" end="00:58:21.309" style="s2">What semi?</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.029" end="00:58:25.029" style="s2">The corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.119" end="00:58:30.578" style="s2">compadres that he had he&#39;d arranged around himself he went too far even for them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.339" end="00:58:35.109" style="s2">thank God for that, you know, but yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.749" end="00:58:37.609" style="s2">Absolutely. I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.609" end="00:58:39.758" style="s2">thing that that the Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.939" end="00:58:47.529" style="s2">Gulag Archipelago did for me and this was also in keeping as a consequence also of reading young at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.529" end="00:58:53.018" style="s2">But but it was certainly the GU like in in large part that did it I would say that in some sense it scared me</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.019" end="00:58:58.029" style="s2">Straight I thought oh, I see the the consequences of unethical behavior</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.969" end="00:59:02.859" style="s2">Deceit the willingness to to turn a blind eye</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.430" end="00:59:11.260" style="s2">so even sins of omission rather than sins of commission just to turn a blind eye the consequences of that are so absolutely dreadful that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.510" end="00:59:13.279" style="s2">It&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.279" end="00:59:16.659" style="s2">Acceptable and I think that&#39;s the right lesson from the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.660" end="00:59:24.339" style="s2">It&#39;s that you you you you you have a much more important moral role to play in keeping things straight</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.589" end="00:59:31.119" style="s2">Then you want to believe you know, people think well, my life is basically meaningless. It&#39;s like well, that&#39;s quite terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.119" end="00:59:35.139" style="s2">It&#39;s like yeah, it&#39;s kind of terrifying but it means you don&#39;t have any responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.690" end="00:59:39.609" style="s2">So there&#39;s a big advantage to thinking that you know now if nothing you do matters</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.740" end="00:59:40.900" style="s2">Then nothing you do matters</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.900" end="00:59:46.990" style="s2">And so you can do whatever you want and and that&#39;s horrifying Anna nihilistic sort of way, but there&#39;s another kind of horror</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.180" end="00:59:48.460" style="s2">That&#39;s more associated</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.460" end="00:59:53.619" style="s2">I think with the horror of hellfire that was characteristic of the medieval christian view is which is something like</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.109" end="00:59:56.139" style="s2">And if you strip it of its metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.140" end="00:59:58.150" style="s2">It&#39;s something like no you don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.609" end="01:00:05.499" style="s2">The things you do actually do the things you do or don&#39;t do they actually do matter and they tilt the world towards</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.750" end="01:00:07.959" style="s2">You know something approximating good</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.960" end="01:00:14.139" style="s2">Let&#39;s say or towards something that very closely approximates hell and that&#39;s actually on you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.299" end="01:00:17.979" style="s2">It&#39;s literally your fault. It&#39;s literally your responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.980" end="01:00:24.699" style="s2">It&#39;s like man, that&#39;s a terrifying I that&#39;s a terrifying idea, but I can&#39;t see how you can read this literature</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.220" end="01:00:26.329" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.329" end="01:00:30.308" style="s2">Coming to that conclusion, like it wasn&#39;t one that I wanted to leap to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.309" end="01:00:30.670" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.670" end="01:00:36.789" style="s2">it&#39;s like as it sits it&#39;s sort of the ultimate in horrifying conclusions that that everybody who</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.010" end="01:00:43.329" style="s2">Participated in this system was at fault for all of it in and Dostoevsky made the same sorts of claims in in in the last</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.329" end="01:00:44.260" style="s2">part of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.260" end="01:00:47.739" style="s2">I mean, he was a very weird mystical sort of person, you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.740" end="01:00:52.389" style="s2">And he he made claims or some of his characters did but on his behalf that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.390" end="01:00:54.789" style="s2">Not only are you responsible for everything you do?</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.789" end="01:00:58.989" style="s2">But in some sense you&#39;re responsible for everything that everyone else does too and you think well</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.029" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">Obviously there&#39;s a way in which that isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.390" end="01:01:09.129" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s delusional in some sense, but there&#39;s another way in which it actually is true, you know, and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.740" end="01:01:15.590" style="s2">Well, I I wrote a book called extreme ownership and it&#39;s it&#39;s very inner soul. Also all this is a whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.650" end="01:01:23.210" style="s2">Thought here, so, you know when I read the book about face, which is not about leadership. It&#39;s not a leadership book</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.210" end="01:01:27.050" style="s2">It&#39;s a it&#39;s a book about a guy that was in the leadership position, but he doesn&#39;t say here&#39;s how you lead</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.050" end="01:01:32.359" style="s2">Here&#39;s what you do here. It&#39;s a book about his experience and what I took away from it, especially because I was in leadership positions</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:40.999" style="s2">In in the military in combat situations that I started seeing all these leadership things that he did and there&#39;s all this crossover</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.520" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:45.619" style="s2">For instance and so for me the crossover was well</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.619" end="01:01:46.109" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.109" end="01:01:50.329" style="s2">Started learning about tactics when I was a young kid because I was in the military and the SEAL Teams and you had to learn</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.330" end="01:01:52.939" style="s2">about how to fire and maneuver like that&#39;s what you do and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.550" end="01:01:57.769" style="s2">Then so you start learning about leadership and then I started training a lot of jujitsu</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.770" end="01:02:03.949" style="s2">And so those things kind of all fit together and it&#39;s very strange how those things started to weave together in my head</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.260" end="01:02:06.180" style="s2">that oh if</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.180" end="01:02:13.040" style="s2">on the battlefield if you want to attack the enemy you don&#39;t do it head-on you you flank them you distract them and then you</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.040" end="01:02:15.379" style="s2">Flank them you come in from the other side in jujitsu</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.380" end="01:02:19.880" style="s2">If you want to submit your opponent, you you don&#39;t just grab their arm</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.880" end="01:02:23.780" style="s2">no, you start to choke them and while they&#39;re defending the choke then you get their arm and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.300" end="01:02:30.589" style="s2">As a leader if you want somebody to do something you just don&#39;t bark that order at them you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.050" end="01:02:34.219" style="s2">flank them and you let them understand why it&#39;s happening and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.310" end="01:02:37.789" style="s2">you know when I started this podcast that I do I</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.369" end="01:02:41.899" style="s2">I started off by saying in the beginning I&#39;d say that&#39;s a podcast about leadership</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:45.859" style="s2">viewed through the lens of war and atrocity and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.890" end="01:02:49.700" style="s2">The more I did it it didn&#39;t take me very long when I was in waltz</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.700" end="01:02:51.700" style="s2">It&#39;s actually a podcast about human nature</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.780" end="01:02:57.349" style="s2">really is what it&#39;s actually about because the better you understand human beings the better you&#39;ll be able to do as a leader because you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.349" end="01:03:01.338" style="s2">Understand what&#39;s happening with those dynamics, which I guess is now leading me into some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.859" end="01:03:05.539" style="s2">Psychology of just kind of where you ended up with of you read this book</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.540" end="01:03:08.689" style="s2">and you said you were studying political science when you read this book and then you said oh</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.910" end="01:03:13.310" style="s2">you looked at the psychology of it and an example that you just brought up and this is just</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.830" end="01:03:18.769" style="s2">what you learn when you read and when you understand history and when you understand the way people think</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">stalin&#39;s surrounded himself with</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.560" end="01:03:24.560" style="s2">People that would say yes to him</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.700" end="01:03:29.649" style="s2">And anybody that didn&#39;t say yes to him. He killed them and I&#39;ll say this again. I&#39;ll talk to military</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.650" end="01:03:31.650" style="s2">She also killed you if you said yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.049" end="01:03:40.179" style="s2">Yeah, the UH I&#39;ll talk to military for sure but also any business leader we talk to business leaders all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.059" end="01:03:45.639" style="s2">You don&#39;t want people you don&#39;t want your subordinates or your superiors</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:49.450" style="s2">When you tell them what to do to just nod their head and say yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.490" end="01:03:54.309" style="s2">You don&#39;t want that now the the the immediate fought especially for a military guy</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.309" end="01:03:55.010" style="s2">they think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.010" end="01:03:56.690" style="s2">Nothing would make my job easier</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.690" end="01:04:01.599" style="s2">Then if I bark an order at you Jordan you work from you&#39;re a private and nama captain and I bark an order</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.599" end="01:04:04.568" style="s2">You know, you just shut up and go do it and that seems like the best thing in the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.970" end="01:04:06.710" style="s2">It&#39;s absolutely not true</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.710" end="01:04:12.099" style="s2">because there&#39;s things that you know on the front lines that I don&#39;t know and if I really want to be a good leader I</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.099" end="01:04:16.929" style="s2">Want you to push back on me and say hey boss. We don&#39;t want to do that. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.930" end="01:04:20.200" style="s2">Let me tell you the situation and instead of men you want to be able to do that</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.200" end="01:04:25.510" style="s2">You want to be able to teach your subordinates to do that without being insubordinate right? Because then it&#39;s not a power play</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.510" end="01:04:27.430" style="s2">It&#39;s that your your interests are aligned</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.430" end="01:04:32.349" style="s2">Our interests are aligned and I actually when I talk to the subordinates cuz I talked to subordinates - yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.349" end="01:04:37.088" style="s2">And I say listen, would you say something to your boss? You don&#39;t say why the hell are we doing that because</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.640" end="01:04:41.349" style="s2">You actually have to be very tacky. Yes. Yes exactly. Hey. Hey. Hey boss</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.349" end="01:04:46.749" style="s2">Um, I want to make sure I&#39;m executing this exactly how you want it. Can you explain to me why we&#39;re doing this?</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.750" end="01:04:53.469" style="s2">So I can really really make it happen out there in the field, you know, and that&#39;s a key thing. So so these ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.069" end="01:04:57.219" style="s2">You know psychology I guess now is I</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.640" end="01:05:02.859" style="s2">Hate to use that word, but because I was just calling a human nature, but these ideas they all kind of come together</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.859" end="01:05:04.859" style="s2">And so now you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.960" end="01:05:13.540" style="s2">Ownership right extreme ownership and this idea that hey I&#39;m responsible for everything. And and so here&#39;s what I&#39;m getting from a leader. Hmm</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.150" end="01:05:18.819" style="s2">They&#39;ll say well whether it&#39;s a business leader or or it&#39;s it&#39;s very easy to use a military leader</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.819" end="01:05:22.449" style="s2">So I&#39;ll get a platoon commander my machine gunner shot in the wrong direction</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.150" end="01:05:25.150" style="s2">How can that be my fault?</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.400" end="01:05:30.339" style="s2">Mm-hm because my machine gunner shot in the wrong - I&#39;m not I&#39;m not holding his weight and I&#39;m not pulling his truck</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.339" end="01:05:33.009" style="s2">How can that possibly be my fault? That&#39;s not my fault</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.280" end="01:05:35.299" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.299" end="01:05:39.549" style="s2">Who&#39;s in charge of that machine gun who&#39;s in charge of making sure he what is fields of fire?</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.550" end="01:05:43.810" style="s2">Who&#39;s in charge of making sure he understands when and where he&#39;s allowed to shoot you are you&#39;re the boss</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.109" end="01:05:46.109" style="s2">This is absolutely your fault had it</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.130" end="01:05:48.340" style="s2">another interesting example of the weather</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.400" end="01:05:55.540" style="s2">The weather is bad. We couldn&#39;t execute our mission. That&#39;s why we failed because we couldn&#39;t launch our helicopter. Yeah, it&#39;s not my fault. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.540" end="01:06:02.139" style="s2">That&#39;s a hard one to argue against. Yeah, except for the fact that if you&#39;re a good leader, you&#39;ll say hey, here&#39;s our plan</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.140" end="01:06:04.270" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna use these helicopters and here&#39;s our contingency</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.270" end="01:06:06.040" style="s2">Yeah, right if there&#39;s bad weather, you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.040" end="01:06:12.099" style="s2">If you don&#39;t take that ownership of what&#39;s going on, if you don&#39;t take responsibility for it, you&#39;re not gonna change it</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.099" end="01:06:14.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna fix it and</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.000" end="01:06:19.899" style="s2">That means you&#39;re never getting any better. You&#39;re not gonna win, right but the minute us end this and obviously</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.840" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">This applies to you know people to purple in you and you know, you tell people to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:27.579" style="s2">I&#39;ve you know, tell them take ownership, but what&#39;s going on in your world?</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.010" end="01:06:30.489" style="s2">it&#39;s this it&#39;s the same thing, but at the end well</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.490" end="01:06:32.889" style="s2">It&#39;s also it also seems to me to be the case</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.890" end="01:06:40.869" style="s2">and I think that this is part of the ethic that&#39;s embedded in in it&#39;s deeply embedded in Christianity with the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.530" end="01:06:47.409" style="s2">The idea that the ultimate sacrifice that you can offer to the world is the sacrifice of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.480" end="01:06:51.849" style="s2">It&#39;s like well imagine that you have to sacrifice something to set the world right while you do</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.040" end="01:06:56.739" style="s2">Obviously because you have to give up things now in order to make things better in the future</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.740" end="01:06:59.199" style="s2">So the sacrificial idea is a very deep one</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.330" end="01:07:03.429" style="s2">then the question might be well, well if you&#39;re gonna sacrifice something</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.430" end="01:07:05.649" style="s2">is it going to be someone else or is it going to be you and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.410" end="01:07:11.770" style="s2">I really think that&#39;s the fundamental question and the right answer to that is that it&#39;s going to be you it&#39;s your fault</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.869" end="01:07:17.799" style="s2">Right you take that on or at least you take on that responsibility and it is it&#39;s a weird thing weirdly</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.260" end="01:07:21.429" style="s2">Difficult to distinguish fault and responsibility, I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.040" end="01:07:26.050" style="s2">Responsibility is the better way of thinking about it, but it&#39;s tied in with the idea of fault</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.050" end="01:07:32.409" style="s2">If it doesn&#39;t go right if it isn&#39;t going right it&#39;s because you&#39;re not good enough now that can be crushing</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.410" end="01:07:37.750" style="s2">there is a problem with that like and you see sometimes people who develop like psychotic depression and they</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.720" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">they they suffer from a</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.210" end="01:07:48.580" style="s2">delusional condition in some sense that the entire moral catastrophe of the world is literally their fault and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.800" end="01:07:56.080" style="s2">There there&#39;s an element of that that&#39;s that&#39;s not productive. There&#39;s a truth in it as well, you know, and and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.600" end="01:07:59.709" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to find the balance so that you can take on that responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.200" end="01:08:01.340" style="s2">without it</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.340" end="01:08:06.579" style="s2">simultaneously being a crushing weight because there&#39;s a lot of things in the world that are really not good and if they&#39;re your fault well</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.580" end="01:08:08.560" style="s2">That&#39;s rather hard on you</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.560" end="01:08:14.529" style="s2">I mean one of the things that the Catholic Church does to help people with that is that it gives them the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.660" end="01:08:17.769" style="s2">To sort of wash their sins off themselves, right?</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.770" end="01:08:21.040" style="s2">You can go to church and you can say well look here&#39;s a bunch of ways that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.109" end="01:08:26.079" style="s2">Being not who I could be and the church authorities say well, you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.510" end="01:08:30.099" style="s2">That&#39;s not good and you should straighten up and all of that and fly</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.100" end="01:08:35.919" style="s2">right, but human beings are fallible and you&#39;re fallible and and and we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.890" end="01:08:38.890" style="s2">crush you because of your</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.530" end="01:08:43.659" style="s2">insufficiency so we&#39;ll wash the slate clean and you can go out there and try again and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.760" end="01:08:50.829" style="s2">It&#39;s very hard to get the balance between those things right so that you can take the responsibility on without being crushed by it</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.830" end="01:08:56.740" style="s2">but but it&#39;s still the case that it seems to me that it&#39;s either your fault or it&#39;s someone else&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.930" end="01:09:00.399" style="s2">as soon as it&#39;s someone else&#39;s then you better be careful because that</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.710" end="01:09:05.140" style="s2">idea that it&#39;s someone else&#39;s is definitely going to appeal to the worst in you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.240" end="01:09:08.289" style="s2">definitely going to happen and if you don&#39;t see that then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.990" end="01:09:16.179" style="s2">Naive or willfully blind and and all that. It&#39;s gonna do all that&#39;s all that that is going to do is make the situation worse</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.910" end="01:09:22.749" style="s2">Yeah, especially because if it&#39;s not my fault and it&#39;s your fault and I can&#39;t control you. What do I do about it?</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.750" end="01:09:29.950" style="s2">I sit there and it just suffer the consequences of the situation as opposed to okay, here&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.950" end="01:09:33.729" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna take responsibility and ownership for it. I&#39;m gonna change it you make it happen you</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.120" end="01:09:39.819" style="s2">talked about turning a blind eye and earlier you talked about turning a blind eye to</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.660" end="01:09:43.930" style="s2">The truth to a situation and I know</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.049" end="01:09:47.049" style="s2">There&#39;s a point in this book where?</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:53.709" style="s2">He talks about the he&#39;s got a buddy that says amnesty is coming right amnesty is coming</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.230" end="01:10:00.399" style="s2">Let&#39;s just keep our mouths shut. Let&#39;s do what we&#39;re told to do and we&#39;ll get, you know, we&#39;ll get out and coming and</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.850" end="01:10:03.850" style="s2">you know Solzhenitsyn says</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.960" end="01:10:06.540" style="s2">He&#39;s an okay. Yeah, and then he says to himself. Wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.180" end="01:10:09.070" style="s2">if I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.070" end="01:10:13.320" style="s2">if I&#39;m not living in order to live</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.530" end="01:10:16.980" style="s2">Then is it worth it? Mmm-hmm. And</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.650" end="01:10:21.900" style="s2">This is a question that I get asked a lot because people get themselves into situations</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.010" end="01:10:31.620" style="s2">Where they&#39;ve lost some kind of control whether it&#39;s they&#39;re in a crappy job or they&#39;ve got a bad boss yeah or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.770" end="01:10:34.660" style="s2">Maybe they&#39;re in a bad relationship</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.660" end="01:10:37.769" style="s2">Maybe their families met but they&#39;re they&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.410" end="01:10:41.219" style="s2">and they and they don&#39;t know what to do and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.640" end="01:10:48.359" style="s2">Part of them. I think anticipates the answer from me to be listen</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.360" end="01:10:53.910" style="s2">Hey, listen, if you&#39;re not if you&#39;re not living in order to live than you, that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.440" end="01:10:59.339" style="s2">But what I actually tell them</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.580" end="01:11:02.580" style="s2">universally almost and there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.550" end="01:11:07.350" style="s2">situations where it goes outside this but you it&#39;s like what I tell them is</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.780" end="01:11:10.770" style="s2">What you need to do right now is you need to play the game</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.290" end="01:11:17.489" style="s2">You need to play the game to get the situation to a point where you can act right?</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.620" end="01:11:21.180" style="s2">So if you&#39;re you got a bad boss, right? Yeah. Oh you okay. You got a bye boss</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.180" end="01:11:24.029" style="s2">I want to tell this guy to go screw himself. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, guess what?</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.030" end="01:11:27.989" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do when my boss tells me something to do that. It doesn&#39;t make much sense. You know what I&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.989" end="01:11:32.339" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do it and I&#39;m gonna do it well and what am I doing? I&#39;m building that relationship with him</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.340" end="01:11:35.549" style="s2">He&#39;s starting to trust me and he&#39;s gonna tell me up to do something else. Now these things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.550" end="01:11:40.739" style="s2">Massive Qatar&#39;s catastrophes. It&#39;s like he&#39;s telling me to do something. Maybe there&#39;s a better way to do it</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.739" end="01:11:42.600" style="s2">You don&#39;t know how to do it that way. Mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.600" end="01:11:47.459" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna play that game and I&#39;m gonna build up that relationship now when eventually he tells me to do something that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.700" end="01:11:53.789" style="s2">Totally stupid or it&#39;s gonna cost you no lives or money then when I say hey boss</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.580" end="01:11:58.799" style="s2">That&#39;s not a great way to do it. I think I know a better way couldn&#39;t we try something else?</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">He actually will listen to me. So I&#39;m gonna play the game a little bit and I&#39;ll tell you my gut instinct</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.719" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">if now I</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.760" end="01:12:11.460" style="s2">guess it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to look from the outside and say hey if I was in this prison camp my gut instinct is like</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.460" end="01:12:15.450" style="s2">Okay, Jacque would you know you&#39;ve been through these kind of things before play the game? You&#39;re gonna play the game</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.480" end="01:12:17.480" style="s2">Which is horrifying</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.480" end="01:12:24.130" style="s2">Mm-hmm, because part of playing that game to the fullest extent here or in a Nazi prison camp would become in a capital. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.130" end="01:12:26.440" style="s2">Oh, you&#39;re playing the game. Yeah. Yeah, you&#39;re playing the game</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.440" end="01:12:30.699" style="s2">Yeah, so and that&#39;s really the outlying that the things that I said that are outlying</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.700" end="01:12:35.740" style="s2">I always make the caveat that if you&#39;re getting asked to do something that&#39;s immoral illegal or unethical</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.260" end="01:12:38.709" style="s2">Then you actually have a duty to say no. I&#39;m not gonna do that</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.860" end="01:12:44.409" style="s2">No, that&#39;s the that&#39;s the line which you know, which you reach that line in the sand with Bill c16</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.600" end="01:12:46.959" style="s2">But which is hey, I&#39;m not going to do this</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.050" end="01:12:50.050" style="s2">but the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.060" end="01:12:51.650" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.650" end="01:12:56.709" style="s2">You got to play the game and yeah, well, that&#39;s even from you when you just said to me you said well</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.710" end="01:13:02.110" style="s2">you know, sometimes you it&#39;s not right to turn a blind eye on things and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.310" end="01:13:07.479" style="s2">Sometimes you have to if you want to get yourself to a position</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.150" end="01:13:11.920" style="s2">like my well, it seems to me that you&#39;re making a distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.530" end="01:13:18.369" style="s2">Discipline and strategy like and and and and like impulsive moral responding</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.370" end="01:13:18.640" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.640" end="01:13:24.249" style="s2">Like let&#39;s say that you are in a situation where you have a boss who&#39;s intolerable and maybe what you&#39;d like to do?</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.350" end="01:13:24.970" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.970" end="01:13:28.599" style="s2">the resentment has built up over five years and you&#39;d like to go in there and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.790" end="01:13:32.920" style="s2">Yell at them and tell them everything you think and you think well, that&#39;s the truth</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.920" end="01:13:39.489" style="s2">It&#39;s like well, it&#39;s actually it&#39;s not a very sophisticated truth because you&#39;re doing as shallow and the impulsive</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.160" end="01:13:44.170" style="s2">analysis of this situation like it would have been the case that</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.510" end="01:13:45.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.500" end="01:13:46.940" style="s2">compromised yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.940" end="01:13:53.559" style="s2">500 ways and I&#39;ll get back to the playing the game issue because you do have to discipline yourself to and and you have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.630" end="01:13:55.430" style="s2">discipline yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.430" end="01:14:02.800" style="s2">some degree by allowing yourself to do arbitrary things that are part of the system, right that&#39;s necessary part of discipline and</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.070" end="01:14:06.070" style="s2">discriminating that from</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.560" end="01:14:11.320" style="s2">Compliance with unethical activity is very difficult. So that&#39;s a hard situation</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.630" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:18.459" style="s2">You&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re going to counsel someone who has an intolerable boss and they come in and they&#39;re right at the end of their tether</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.460" end="01:14:22.690" style="s2">Because maybe that&#39;s why they come for counseling they say I really want to tell that son of a bitch what I think of him</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.690" end="01:14:26.049" style="s2">And you think well, wait a second here. Okay, first of all</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.720" end="01:14:28.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.570" end="01:14:33.879" style="s2">Eradicated from the list of reasonable possibilities that</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.550" end="01:14:36.050" style="s2">decision by</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.050" end="01:14:38.050" style="s2">Failing to say small things</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.150" end="01:14:43.569" style="s2">That you could have said all the way along and it&#39;s not like you can just all of a sudden blurt all of that out</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.570" end="01:14:48.279" style="s2">Now and that wipes the slate clean and that constitutes truth, it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.830" end="01:14:53.889" style="s2">Unsophisticated, so let&#39;s think okay. So what is it that you want? Well, I don&#39;t want this job anymore</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.489" end="01:15:01.209" style="s2">It&#39;s like okay now, let&#39;s actually have a strategy about this then you don&#39;t want this job anymore. Can you get another job?</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.570" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">Well, I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:09.279" style="s2">Well, so you can&#39;t just quit. Well, no, I can&#39;t because then I don&#39;t have any money and my family depends on the job</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:10.030" style="s2">It&#39;s like, okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.030" end="01:15:15.909" style="s2">so you can&#39;t just stop this that that&#39;s not a viable solution you go out of the frying pan into the fire or</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.980" end="01:15:22.959" style="s2">You know, you suck you you substitute one set of unethical actions for another set of unethical actions that are even worse</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.150" end="01:15:29.020" style="s2">That&#39;s not helpful. All right, so let&#39;s start thinking about what exactly it is that you want</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.020" end="01:15:35.679" style="s2">It&#39;s like well, maybe I want a better job. I want to work for someone who&#39;s more reasonable. Ok. So what&#39;s stopping you?</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.860" end="01:15:41.020" style="s2">Well, I don&#39;t have my CV in order. My resume isn&#39;t up to date. Well, why is that?</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.020" end="01:15:43.569" style="s2">Well, I haven&#39;t done it for five years and I don&#39;t like doing it</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.570" end="01:15:48.460" style="s2">Well, why is that well because I&#39;m kind of embarrassed about it because it has holes in it then it shows where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.250" end="01:15:53.350" style="s2">Lackadaisical and where I&#39;m not prepared it&#39;s like ok. How many things are there like that?</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.350" end="01:15:58.419" style="s2">Well, there&#39;s a bunch of things and they&#39;re all associated with how I procrastinated in the past. It&#39;s like ok</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.420" end="01:16:03.219" style="s2">What are we going to do to rectify that so I&#39;ll say to people why don&#39;t you update your CV?</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.440" end="01:16:08.230" style="s2">That&#39;s what we&#39;ll do first. Because if you&#39;re going to look for a different job, I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re gonna look for a different job</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.780" end="01:16:11.170" style="s2">But if you&#39;re going to look for a different job</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.199" end="01:16:17.469" style="s2">You&#39;re not going to unless your CV s updated one is not going to unless you can get a good recommendation from this boss</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.469" end="01:16:21.969" style="s2">That&#39;s a Terran and so that&#39;s right. There&#39;s you gotta play. There&#39;s Tanis strategic</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:29.170" style="s2">actions that you&#39;re gonna have to take in order to make yourself able to move laterally or up and the truth is</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.960" end="01:16:33.609" style="s2">Isn&#39;t going in and yelling at your boss and telling them everything you think about them</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.610" end="01:16:34.610" style="s2">the truth is</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.610" end="01:16:36.759" style="s2">trying to figure out the very very</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.860" end="01:16:43.569" style="s2">Difficult process of how you put yourself in a better position and that out like one of the things that&#39;s quite fun about this lecture</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.570" end="01:16:44.290" style="s2">tour</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.290" end="01:16:48.519" style="s2">Is the letters that I receive or the stories that people tell me about switching jobs</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.890" end="01:16:52.269" style="s2">Because they do realize that there and I often talk to people about</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.030" end="01:16:55.030" style="s2">Consulting their resentment</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.400" end="01:16:58.089" style="s2">Resentments are really useful emotion. Like it&#39;s really dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.000" end="01:17:01.839" style="s2">It&#39;s one of the most dangerous psychological states</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.840" end="01:17:08.440" style="s2">I believe but it&#39;s unbelievably useful because resentment usually only means one of two things it either means</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.500" end="01:17:11.150" style="s2">quit whining and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.150" end="01:17:18.190" style="s2">Take it on because you&#39;re immature or it means you&#39;re allowing yourself to be taken advantage of and you have something to say or do</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.190" end="01:17:18.740" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.740" end="01:17:24.339" style="s2">so you want to sort out the first part and find out if you&#39;re just being immature and you can think that through and you</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.340" end="01:17:26.340" style="s2">can talk to people</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.540" end="01:17:29.379" style="s2">And but in that but if it&#39;s the second it&#39;s like no you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.450" end="01:17:34.599" style="s2">Compromised yourself in a variety of ways and you have to figure out how to get out of that. And if you&#39;re resentful that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.060" end="01:17:38.410" style="s2">Evidence that you have in fact done that okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.410" end="01:17:43.299" style="s2">So now that issue would be well, how can you set your life up so that you can be without that resentment?</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.300" end="01:17:49.780" style="s2">And so that&#39;s when you start to develop a strategy for you know, and and it there&#39;s actually an adventure in this tool</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.780" end="01:17:55.269" style="s2">I mean, I&#39;ve had a number of clients who have been in jobs that they didn&#39;t like at all and you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.270" end="01:18:01.780" style="s2">They were terrorized by someone for example, and they were also working below their hypothetical level and we&#39;d put together a plan</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.780" end="01:18:05.679" style="s2">It&#39;s like okay, you&#39;re gonna make three times as much money in in five years</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.810" end="01:18:08.769" style="s2">That&#39;s the plan but like that&#39;s not gonna be simple</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.770" end="01:18:15.129" style="s2">So you there&#39;s education you got to educate yourself maybe formally because you&#39;ve got holes you got to fix up your resume</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.530" end="01:18:18.819" style="s2">You&#39;ve got to you&#39;ve got to overcome your fear of being interviewed</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.160" end="01:18:25.539" style="s2">You have to start sending out like 50 resumes a week on a regular basis and be prepared for a 99%</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.730" end="01:18:28.209" style="s2">Rejection rate you. You&#39;re going to look for a different job</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.210" end="01:18:32.319" style="s2">It&#39;s probably going to take six months to a year and almost all of that is going to be rejection</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.320" end="01:18:38.710" style="s2">You got to steal yourself from for that and prepare and maybe this is going to be a three year process. It&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.230" end="01:18:41.150" style="s2">trivial thing but you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.150" end="01:18:42.910" style="s2">It&#39;s almost inevitably</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.910" end="01:18:48.939" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember a single example where the consequence of that very careful</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.370" end="01:18:51.579" style="s2">detailed strategic thinking wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.850" end="01:18:55.269" style="s2">massively substantive improvement in</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.910" end="01:18:59.919" style="s2">socio-economic positioning and a great movement towards a an</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.650" end="01:19:07.539" style="s2">improving trajectory and and and there&#39;s advantages even along the way because even before that happens the fact that you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.999" end="01:19:10.329" style="s2">Genuine steps to put yourself in a better situation</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.969" end="01:19:13.928" style="s2">Immediately starts to reduce your resentment</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.929" end="01:19:15.439" style="s2">Even if it isn&#39;t having positive</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.439" end="01:19:21.099" style="s2">Consequences to begin with but you have to be realistic about it&#39;s like look it&#39;s gonna be hard to update your CV because you&#39;re embarrassed</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.099" end="01:19:24.279" style="s2">About it, and you should be. Alright. It&#39;s no wonder you&#39;re embarrassed about it</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.280" end="01:19:25.510" style="s2">And then well, of course</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.510" end="01:19:29.949" style="s2">You don&#39;t want to go be interviewed because you&#39;re not very good at it and there&#39;s holes in your story</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.949" end="01:19:34.958" style="s2">And and your and you can be made nervous easily and you&#39;re not a very good advocate for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.959" end="01:19:37.449" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of improvement that needs to be done there and</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.209" end="01:19:41.379" style="s2">and then you have to withstand the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.229" end="01:19:48.188" style="s2">The punishment of being constantly rejected when you apply for jobs because the baseline rejection rate</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.189" end="01:19:54.819" style="s2">You know for the for the typical job applicant is like 99 percent. It&#39;s like the rejection rate for everything is this gonna work?</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.979" end="01:19:59.769" style="s2">No, but if you do it a hundred times, it might work once that&#39;s all you need</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.769" end="01:20:00.860" style="s2">That&#39;s exactly it</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.860" end="01:20:03.999" style="s2">You you you only need that once and so the truth</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.999" end="01:20:07.509" style="s2">There isn&#39;t to yell at your boss the truth there is to get your life together. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.380" end="01:20:14.769" style="s2">Play the game. You gotta play the game sometimes to to get a strategic win to me</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.769" end="01:20:17.529" style="s2">And that&#39;s and another interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.530" end="01:20:22.539" style="s2">Here is as I say you don&#39;t want to surround yourself with yes-men when you&#39;re a leadership position</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.820" end="01:20:24.650" style="s2">You also don&#39;t want to be your own</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.650" end="01:20:31.509" style="s2">Personal yes-man that just thinks you&#39;re great and agrees with everything that you&#39;re doing and and won&#39;t tell yourself the hard truth</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.510" end="01:20:31.840" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.840" end="01:20:36.219" style="s2">You can&#39;t lie to yourself everything every little one of those things that you just listed off are</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.499" end="01:20:40.539" style="s2">The kind of things that people just lie to themselves and say yeah, you know what? Well you</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.389" end="01:20:45.518" style="s2">Don&#39;t really need that that person didn&#39;t learn anything and that in that course</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.519" end="01:20:51.668" style="s2">Why should I go to it that you know, it&#39;s like if you don&#39;t tell yourself the truth about your what your situation is</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.669" end="01:20:55.119" style="s2">It&#39;s gonna be problematic just like if you don&#39;t have people on your team</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.489" end="01:20:59.888" style="s2">Above you or below you in the chain of command that tell you the truth that&#39;s gonna be problematic as well</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.309" end="01:21:03.909" style="s2">Which is something here, which is something that&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.850" end="01:21:10.040" style="s2">So the playing the game thing. So are you thinking about that as a consequence of necessary discipline?</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.040" end="01:21:15.229" style="s2">you know like because they&#39;re weak because it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.750" end="01:21:21.259" style="s2">You&#39;re making two cases at the same time right one is that you should obviously not undertake unethical actions</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.260" end="01:21:26.810" style="s2">But then by the same token and and you have to subordinate yourself to the realities of the situation</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.000" end="01:21:32.839" style="s2">And and I think that that&#39;s psychologically true because you&#39;re always in a situation where if you&#39;re in an organization</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.390" end="01:21:39.650" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of an arbitrary and tyrannical aspect to it because it&#39;s never working perfectly and then and then there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.780" end="01:21:43.670" style="s2">Positive aspect to it too. And so whenever you&#39;re doing a job</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.550" end="01:21:48.020" style="s2">it could be that you&#39;re you&#39;re called upon to do things that</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.410" end="01:21:53.360" style="s2">What would you say that are a necessary part of the operation of the machinery?</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.360" end="01:21:58.699" style="s2">I guess that would be particularly true in military situation. Yes and let me give you well, just a broad example, right?</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.460" end="01:22:01.460" style="s2">you know my personality and</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.220" end="01:22:04.220" style="s2">my reputation is</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.490" end="01:22:08.510" style="s2">That you know when I was in the military, it&#39;s like oh, it&#39;s Jocko</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.510" end="01:22:13.040" style="s2">hey, he&#39;s not gonna you know, he&#39;s if someone tells him to do something doesn&#39;t want to do he&#39;s just gonna you know,</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.040" end="01:22:16.279" style="s2">say screw you yeah, we&#39;re not doing we&#39;re doing it my way, you know, um</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.280" end="01:22:17.790" style="s2">I got the nut butt</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.790" end="01:22:21.769" style="s2">And that was kind of the impression people would get from me if they didn&#39;t know me from the outside</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.770" end="01:22:24.770" style="s2">They think oh this guy&#39;s a knuckle dragger. He&#39;s gonna go forward</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.290" end="01:22:30.319" style="s2">He&#39;s gonna make things happen and he&#39;s not gonna listen anyone else. That was the impression from the outside</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.840" end="01:22:35.630" style="s2">The reality is a you you can&#39;t do that and and be the reality is</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.600" end="01:22:40.160" style="s2">What my actions right I&#39;d have, you know a young lieutenant would come to me and say hey, you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.160" end="01:22:44.599" style="s2">My bosses do tell me to do this this and this and what they think I was gonna say is like, bro</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.600" end="01:22:46.340" style="s2">You don&#39;t do that right end up</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.340" end="01:22:52.190" style="s2">You tell him screw you that doesn&#39;t make any sense and maybe they get this look in their eyes of surprise</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.220" end="01:22:57.770" style="s2">Yeah when I&#39;d say, oh your boss wants you to do that do it do it. Well play the game</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.770" end="01:23:00.619" style="s2">That&#39;s what I&#39;m telling to do is play the game because these things are meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.620" end="01:23:04.910" style="s2">It&#39;s something you know is something is patheticness like oh you got to fill out a form a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.910" end="01:23:08.420" style="s2">It&#39;s like hey, shut up and play the game. Look even Maya</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.420" end="01:23:10.609" style="s2">So is that a Madol matter of picking your battles?</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.890" end="01:23:17.540" style="s2">it certainly is a matter of picking your battles and you as that&#39;s part of strategy right like everything can&#39;t be the war a</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.830" end="01:23:19.040" style="s2">exactly and</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.040" end="01:23:23.890" style="s2">It&#39;s exactly what it is, but you know a good example and we wrote about it in in</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.010" end="01:23:32.079" style="s2">Dichotomy leadership, which is, you know, my friend my guy that worked for me Lafe babban. We were getting told to do all this paperwork</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.870" end="01:23:37.390" style="s2">You gotta you gotta fill out these forms. You&#39;ve gotta you gotta have a serialized inventory of everything</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.390" end="01:23:38.770" style="s2">It&#39;s gotta be signed off this many days</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.770" end="01:23:44.859" style="s2">we need to know the the qualifications of each and every person and when their qualifications come up due and all these just</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.080" end="01:23:48.280" style="s2">Ridiculous paperwork and Lafe came to me</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.280" end="01:23:52.839" style="s2">And with with the other platoon commander guy named Seth that came to me and said ah man this is bullshit</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.970" end="01:23:56.649" style="s2">Why do we got to do all this paperwork? We&#39;re we&#39;re here training for war</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.650" end="01:24:01.480" style="s2">we&#39;re getting ready for war why we got to do this and you know life will tell you his and</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.270" end="01:24:03.910" style="s2">Expectation was that I was gonna be like you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.910" end="01:24:08.320" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go to the commanding officer and tell him screw this we&#39;re not doing this stuff. This is crap</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.320" end="01:24:12.639" style="s2">We&#39;re trying to prepare because we were in training getting ready to deploy to Iraq. This is crap</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.640" end="01:24:15.160" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing this and I looked at him and said</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.160" end="01:24:19.329" style="s2">Oh, we&#39;re doing all of this paperwork and not only were you gonna do this paperwork?</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.330" end="01:24:23.289" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do it better than anyone else and we&#39;re gonna turn it in before it&#39;s even do</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.840" end="01:24:26.380" style="s2">You know, we both him and Seth were kind of taken aback</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.380" end="01:24:31.810" style="s2">then the fact that I wasn&#39;t standing up and saying we&#39;re not doing this crap and</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.780" end="01:24:38.469" style="s2">Then I explained him. Here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing. We&#39;re building a relationship with my commanding officer with our commanding officer</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.660" end="01:24:40.630" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna do these little things for him</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.630" end="01:24:46.450" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna play the game because at some point two things are gonna happen. Number one. We want to build trust with my boss</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.450" end="01:24:49.329" style="s2">I want my boss to look at me and when he tells me to do to fill out paperwork</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.420" end="01:24:51.760" style="s2">He knows gonna be filled out if he wants me to take down a building</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.760" end="01:24:55.869" style="s2">He knows it&#39;s gonna get taken out if he wants me to execute up a larger mission. I&#39;ll go and get it done</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.930" end="01:24:58.329" style="s2">We&#39;re built if I can&#39;t fill out paperwork correctly</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.700" end="01:25:03.220" style="s2">How can you trust me to go on and on a real operation and have guys lives at risk?</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.590" end="01:25:10.780" style="s2">So the idea is like hey, we&#39;re gonna play the game and I think sometimes people start to hear me</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.780" end="01:25:16.749" style="s2">They start to listen to me and their first instinct is Jaco wouldn&#39;t put up with them shit. Yeah, and</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.390" end="01:25:20.589" style="s2">That&#39;s why these you know, they&#39;ll hit me up the same thing. They&#39;ll write me an email</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.590" end="01:25:23.740" style="s2">They&#39;ll write me a letter and say here&#39;s the situation. I&#39;m in on</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:30.399" style="s2">Whether it&#39;s a boss, whether it&#39;s a military, it&#39;s any of them whether it&#39;s their wife like like my wife</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.210" end="01:25:35.919" style="s2">It&#39;s me not to change it to something as stupid as that like my wife won&#39;t let me train. It&#39;s driving me crazy</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:42.190" style="s2">It&#39;s really starting to bother me, but why won&#39;t she well, what&#39;s the problem? Hey, have you taken her out for dinner?</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.280" end="01:25:46.420" style="s2">You mean like play the damn game a little bit so that you can win</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.670" end="01:25:50.440" style="s2">Strategically and it&#39;s the same thing I think with your with the 12 rules</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.440" end="01:25:52.480" style="s2">We were like, hey, tell the truth or at least don&#39;t lie</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.480" end="01:25:53.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.870" end="01:25:54.650" style="s2">Get it</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.650" end="01:25:58.359" style="s2">but there&#39;s a dichotomy in that statement and that is if you run around telling</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.430" end="01:26:04.329" style="s2">the absolute truth that everyone it&#39;s gonna be like that Jim Carrey movie where he can&#39;t say anything that&#39;s not 100% true and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.550" end="01:26:09.580" style="s2">You know Gert woman says good morning, and he says you look fat, you know, it&#39;s like one of those like very not good</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.100" end="01:26:14.950" style="s2">And so you gotta learn to play the game and and I guess again going back to this book. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.220" end="01:26:20.920" style="s2">That&#39;s a tough call to make in these situations. How much do you play the game?</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.920" end="01:26:24.819" style="s2">And there&#39;s an ethical line that you could cross at some point if I become a capo</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.550" end="01:26:32.230" style="s2">Hey, hmm, you just you played the game and you went too far with it and just like in a leadership situation</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.750" end="01:26:38.020" style="s2">If Ike if you&#39;re my boss, and I&#39;m just kissing your ass and do wonder every to my guys lose respect for me</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.020" end="01:26:40.120" style="s2">Yeah, my team will lose respect for me</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.120" end="01:26:43.569" style="s2">If you tell me to do something completely stupid and I say hey guys, that&#39;s what the boss says</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.570" end="01:26:44.080" style="s2">We&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.080" end="01:26:47.499" style="s2">my guys will lose respect for me and I won&#39;t be I</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.690" end="01:26:54.370" style="s2">Won&#39;t be able to execute missions the way I should if when the pushback is proper I say hey. Hey boss</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.370" end="01:26:58.209" style="s2">Yeah, that doesn&#39;t make any sense. We shouldn&#39;t do that and I go to the guys and say listen</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.210" end="01:27:03.069" style="s2">I told I talked to him we&#39;re gonna see what he says, but trust me if we have to do this</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.070" end="01:27:09.190" style="s2">We&#39;ll we&#39;ll figure out a way to make it work because if you&#39;re just the guy that&#39;s totally on board if you&#39;re a brown-noser, right?</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.710" end="01:27:13.930" style="s2">You&#39;re Pete your guys will lose respect for you 100% They will they&#39;ll lose respect for you</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.970" end="01:27:18.070" style="s2">If you don&#39;t play the game at all and you push back on everything that your boss says</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.770" end="01:27:21.999" style="s2">You&#39;re gonna you&#39;re not gonna get fired. Yeah, that&#39;s another DEATH achill situation</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.000" end="01:27:24.000" style="s2">Like if my mom if you&#39;re my boss and you tell me to do something</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.260" end="01:27:27.310" style="s2">that&#39;s I don&#39;t believe in or it&#39;s like a bad plan and</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.740" end="01:27:31.840" style="s2">I may I draw the line in the sand and say screw you Jordan. We&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.840" end="01:27:35.770" style="s2">You can fire me. You&#39;re like, okay fine. You fire me you get some yes-man to come in</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.770" end="01:27:38.620" style="s2">He takes my guys out on the mission and get some all killed</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.680" end="01:27:46.109" style="s2">He didn&#39;t mitigate the risk properly it better for me. Ethically to say. Hey look Jordan. I don&#39;t agree with this plan</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.110" end="01:27:49.769" style="s2">I really wish we could do it another way. Is there any way I could flex on it? You say nope</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.770" end="01:27:54.450" style="s2">You&#39;re doing it this way. It is better for me in many situations to say, okay. Oh, I got it</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.480" end="01:27:58.110" style="s2">an indication of the complexity of the truth</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.110" end="01:28:00.509" style="s2">I mean one of the rules of thumb that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.610" end="01:28:07.529" style="s2">think is worth abiding by and I guess this is something that makes me somewhat conservative in some ways is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.230" end="01:28:12.600" style="s2">you should do what everyone else does unless there&#39;s a very good reason not to and</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.790" end="01:28:17.280" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s the same idea that you&#39;re putting forward, which is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.040" end="01:28:24.810" style="s2">If you if you do fight back against everything then you&#39;re just too rebel without a cause right and you and you discredit yourself entirely</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.810" end="01:28:29.249" style="s2">And if you accept everything well, then you&#39;re not even there. And so there&#39;s some judicious</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.770" end="01:28:35.910" style="s2">Analysis of the situation that helps you understand when the time for action is right and most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.490" end="01:28:41.880" style="s2">What you&#39;re doing in life is you&#39;re doing what other people do and that&#39;s going along with the game</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.100" end="01:28:43.240" style="s2">That&#39;s part of being</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.240" end="01:28:48.449" style="s2">socialized but there&#39;s going to be times when the right thing to do is to break a rule and to do it very carefully and</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.580" end="01:28:50.470" style="s2">so and</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.470" end="01:28:51.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.970" end="01:28:53.760" style="s2">There&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a scene</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.760" end="01:28:59.039" style="s2">I think this is a New Testament scene, but it might be in some of the apocryphal right apocryphal writings</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.040" end="01:29:02.850" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember so Christ is walking down the road on the Sabbath and</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.640" end="01:29:04.990" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.990" end="01:29:08.670" style="s2">There&#39;s a ditch by the road and it&#39;s very hot and in the ditch</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.670" end="01:29:10.560" style="s2">There&#39;s a hole and in the hole. There&#39;s a sheep</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.560" end="01:29:13.890" style="s2">And so the Sheep is stuck in the hole and this guy</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.990" end="01:29:17.940" style="s2">Shepherd is trying to get the Sheep out of the hole and Christ walks by and he says if</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.310" end="01:29:23.130" style="s2">You don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re a transgressor of the law and you&#39;re cursed</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.130" end="01:29:26.039" style="s2">But if you do understand what you&#39;re doing then you&#39;re blessed</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.650" end="01:29:32.789" style="s2">So it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a perfect example of that a because it&#39;s it&#39;s like if you&#39;re okay now, here&#39;s your situation</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.790" end="01:29:36.870" style="s2">You&#39;re a shepherd and you&#39;re supposed to be taking care of that sheep, right? But it&#39;s the Sabbath day</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.870" end="01:29:39.840" style="s2">so you&#39;re not supposed to be working now if you have</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.170" end="01:29:44.129" style="s2">Decided you&#39;ve thought this through you think it&#39;s the Sabbath day</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.290" end="01:29:48.900" style="s2">This is something that everybody needs because everybody needs to take a rest and this is a rule</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.900" end="01:29:53.400" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t break because everybody needs to take a rest or things degenerate and</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.800" end="01:29:56.699" style="s2">I understand and I have a lot of respect for it</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.860" end="01:29:59.250" style="s2">But I think that in this situation</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.250" end="01:30:05.550" style="s2">It&#39;s still morally appropriate for me to break that rule in this slight way and get this poor sheep out of this hole then</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.190" end="01:30:09.899" style="s2">While Christ&#39;s judgment was well, then you&#39;re exactly on the right track</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.900" end="01:30:13.530" style="s2">But if you&#39;re doing it carelessly and stupidly you&#39;re breaking that rule then</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.780" end="01:30:18.749" style="s2">You&#39;re a transgressor of the law and you&#39;re cursed and I think that&#39;s exactly at the essence of what you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.750" end="01:30:21.120" style="s2">It&#39;s like you play by the rules</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.700" end="01:30:27.869" style="s2">but then there&#39;s a meta rule which is now and then you break the rules and you do that very very carefully because when you</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.870" end="01:30:32.399" style="s2">Break the rules you&#39;re breaking the rules and the rules are what keep? Peace</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.530" end="01:30:35.699" style="s2">They&#39;re what keep peace and order and so you break them</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.890" end="01:30:41.669" style="s2">only in the service of a higher peace and order and so that seems to be and I think that&#39;s you see this in</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.220" end="01:30:48.479" style="s2">in well the sorts of stories that are influencing even the things that you&#39;re writing like in the Harry Potter series, for example</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.030" end="01:30:51.030" style="s2">Harry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.040" end="01:30:57.060" style="s2">Friends and campaig treats are quite disciplined Hermione in particular because she&#39;s an absolute master of her craft</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.250" end="01:31:03.000" style="s2">but they still break rules when it&#39;s necessary only when it&#39;s necessary and that&#39;s what makes them more than</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.670" end="01:31:10.440" style="s2">the people who are just breaking rules all the time the villains so to speak and also makes them more than the people that are</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.450" end="01:31:12.510" style="s2">just being good by being</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.420" end="01:31:15.420" style="s2">conformist so you need that that</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.970" end="01:31:23.639" style="s2">Touch of rebellious nut. It&#39;s got to be a flavoring and not the whole diet. Absolutely. I&#39;ve actually talked about that on this podcast before</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.340" end="01:31:28.920" style="s2">the there&#39;s people in the military that they are like</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.620" end="01:31:34.620" style="s2">Meta rule-followers. These are people that have been following rules or whole lives. Yeah, they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.230" end="01:31:38.220" style="s2">perfect grades and they were the team can do all these things and</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.890" end="01:31:42.899" style="s2">They&#39;re gonna make really good solid leaders like they&#39;re gonna be great leaders</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.900" end="01:31:46.680" style="s2">Yep, but then there&#39;s this like one group above them</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.680" end="01:31:51.749" style="s2">Yeah have that same thing, but they also have that little bit of rebellion that they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.750" end="01:31:58.439" style="s2">You know what? We&#39;re not doing that. It doesn&#39;t make any sense and that is really an important</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.990" end="01:32:02.429" style="s2">Factor to have yeah, but you know, that&#39;s one of the reasons I like this guy Colonel. David, hackworth</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.580" end="01:32:07.530" style="s2">This guy was the ultimate rule follower for his whole career at the end</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.290" end="01:32:10.000" style="s2">in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.000" end="01:32:13.830" style="s2">He did an interview and said if we keep fighting this way, we&#39;re not gonna win this war</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.870" end="01:32:16.349" style="s2">Mm-hmm, and they drove him out of the army. Mhm, but</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.900" end="01:32:21.270" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s the thing that because all along the way there was other times where he do that, you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.270" end="01:32:24.120" style="s2">His guys weren&#39;t getting taken care of. He&#39;d break a rule and bring him beer or he do, you know?</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.120" end="01:32:24.420" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.420" end="01:32:26.420" style="s2">He&#39;d do that along the way not not</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.650" end="01:32:30.660" style="s2">So far outside the bounds that it would jeopardize his career because if he would do that</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.660" end="01:32:35.669" style="s2">Then you&#39;re not in charge of these guys anymore. Yeah now you&#39;re not gonna have any impact. Yeah, so let&#39;s not get fired</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.710" end="01:32:40.410" style="s2">Right, right. Let&#39;s not get stupidly fired. Right? That&#39;s not an improvement</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.199" end="01:32:43.409" style="s2">Exactly. Well, that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.350" end="01:32:45.690" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.690" end="01:32:52.230" style="s2">I guess we I know you got to go so I can&#39;t think that we could get to a better little crust of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.380" end="01:32:55.560" style="s2">Little capstone of the conversation than right there</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.500" end="01:33:01.049" style="s2">Thanks for coming on again. Hey, my pleasure, man. I&#39;m glad we got a chance to talk about this book</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.050" end="01:33:03.050" style="s2">this is a book that everybody should read and</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.340" end="01:33:09.840" style="s2">And you you I ordered the I ordered a copy of yours with a Ford yet from Europe. Yep</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.870" end="01:33:12.749" style="s2">You can&#39;t buy it from Amazon here, you know yet from Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.750" end="01:33:14.759" style="s2">So it&#39;ll be here when will it but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.760" end="01:33:18.449" style="s2">We&#39;re still negotiating the rights cuz the rights holders differ in North America</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.449" end="01:33:20.400" style="s2">And so that&#39;s the issue at the moment sofa</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.400" end="01:33:20.890" style="s2">so I</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.890" end="01:33:27.569" style="s2">Worked with an English publisher penguin in in the UK that that put out the I think it&#39;s Vantage books if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.570" end="01:33:30.060" style="s2">I should just check and make sure that that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.180" end="01:33:33.180" style="s2">Harper Perennial modern classics</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.730" end="01:33:37.169" style="s2">That is not that&#39;s not the British one. Oh, that&#39;s no that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.810" end="01:33:41.910" style="s2">British one hasn&#39;t gotten to my house. Yeah. I&#39;m so shit. Yeah, it has to be ordered</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.910" end="01:33:46.680" style="s2">It has to be ordered through Amazon UK and we&#39;re working on a couple of things maybe two also</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.930" end="01:33:50.699" style="s2">Maybe get the audio rights to the abridged version because I&#39;d like to read it</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.770" end="01:33:56.339" style="s2">Nice, and that would be good so that people could listen to it. And so because it&#39;s it&#39;s an absolutely necessary book</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.370" end="01:34:00.749" style="s2">Yeah, and it&#39;s written actually what I like because it&#39;s written very conversation</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.780" end="01:34:06.300" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s cracking jokes in there and he&#39;s making it&#39;s a brilliant piece of literature as well as I mean</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.300" end="01:34:13.890" style="s2">It&#39;s a very readable book. Although it&#39;s unbelievably harsh and and and demanding and and draining to read but it&#39;s it&#39;s brilliantly written</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.890" end="01:34:15.890" style="s2">It&#39;s an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.000" end="01:34:21.689" style="s2">Engrossing read and in the most horrible possible way but and and it is the case</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.850" end="01:34:25.720" style="s2">it&#39;s written at this white-hot pace, you know, it&#39;s like talking to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.540" end="01:34:31.689" style="s2">Righteously not self righteously angry, but righteously angry four four ball</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.690" end="01:34:37.690" style="s2">Four four four dozens of hours and you just can&#39;t believe the levels of outrage that are that are being</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.950" end="01:34:41.450" style="s2">That are being</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.450" end="01:34:48.220" style="s2">So incredibly well expressed and so effectively expressed and and and again, I think it&#39;s also worth</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.160" end="01:34:51.160" style="s2">emphasizing the fact that you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.200" end="01:34:52.190" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.190" end="01:34:59.740" style="s2">contribution in many ways was to lay the catastrophe at the feet of the doctrine and not to say no this is this wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.020" end="01:35:06.879" style="s2">Aberration because of Stalin or you know, Lenin being the great leader and then Stellan being the monster because Lenin was plenty monster himself</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.640" end="01:35:11.709" style="s2">And Stalin was the logical conclusion to Lenin not not an aberration</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.140" end="01:35:16.780" style="s2">but to say that no the horrors of what happened in the Soviet Union were were</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.330" end="01:35:18.980" style="s2">implicit in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.980" end="01:35:22.149" style="s2">collectivist system utopian system that gave rise to the</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.610" end="01:35:26.050" style="s2">Philosophy to begin with and that that&#39;s also an explanation. Why the same?</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.330" end="01:35:32.470" style="s2">Catastrophes occurred wherever the Soviet system was applied everywhere else in the world. It&#39;s something we really need to know</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.470" end="01:35:37.720" style="s2">I mean, we fought a whole Cold War over that we put damn near put the world to the torch because of this and</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.270" end="01:35:45.580" style="s2">the idea that these ideas are the fact that these ideas are creeping back is really it&#39;s unbearable as far as I&#39;m concerned, so</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.940" end="01:35:53.830" style="s2">Hopefully people read in this book and the the re-release of this book with your ford will prevent that from happening</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.170" end="01:35:58.670" style="s2">In the</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.670" end="01:36:01.000" style="s2">Other people can put drops into as well</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.000" end="01:36:06.640" style="s2">And so i&#39;m hoping I mean, I think the book has sold 15,000 copies since the beginning of november</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.640" end="01:36:09.039" style="s2">Which is pretty good for the reissue an old classic</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.040" end="01:36:15.399" style="s2">But like it it it&#39;s required reading for an informed citizen of the 21st century</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.520" end="01:36:18.430" style="s2">It&#39;s not optional. You need to know this material</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.560" end="01:36:25.749" style="s2">You&#39;re not you&#39;re not you don&#39;t understand your position in society as an individual or a citizen without</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.970" end="01:36:32.439" style="s2">Knowing this material so it&#39;s like not knowing about what happened in Nazi Germany. It&#39;s not acceptable to not know</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.180" end="01:36:39.839" style="s2">Read the book thanks for coming good. Really. Good. See again, man. Absolutely. Yeah be better appreciate it</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.750" end="01:36:42.750" style="s2">and with that</p>

<p begin="01:41:26.780" end="01:41:29.259" style="s2">And um, you know, he used to tell me</p>

<p begin="01:41:35.780" end="01:41:41.919" style="s2">And then when you started talking about it, like literally the day you start talking I start taking it</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.440" end="01:41:46.030" style="s2">And he was like he didn&#39;t care. It kind of went right over his head and I was like, oh</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.030" end="01:41:48.030" style="s2">So did you feel the difference?</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.440" end="01:41:50.440" style="s2">You know, like that&#39;s what he was concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.090" end="01:41:55.090" style="s2">Also on top of that you got Moke</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.520" end="01:41:57.410" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.410" end="01:42:04.300" style="s2">Which is mulk basically that&#39;s what it is. It&#39;s a it has protein in it. You mix it with milk</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.300" end="01:42:07.179" style="s2">I got a man I to make that statement if you mix it with well</p>

<p begin="01:42:12.350" end="01:42:14.350" style="s2">If you mix it with water</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.420" end="01:42:16.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.340" end="01:42:21.249" style="s2">not jumping up and down about it and telling you it&#39;s the most delicious thing in the world if you mix it with milk whole</p>

<p begin="01:42:43.210" end="01:42:48.010" style="s2">It&#39;s got the little crappy marshmallows in it. Yeah, that&#39;s not this a non-starter for me. Yeah, so that&#39;s kind of the point there</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.010" end="01:42:53.919" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s sorta that you know along the same lines where it said cool do it and it&#39;s okay you can do it</p>

<p begin="01:47:41.619" end="01:47:45.909" style="s2">Like why does it work every single time and here&#39;s part of it, even you, you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.909" end="01:47:50.138" style="s2">Like when you get hypnotized, I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re we should have I should have asked I should have asked Jordan this question</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.300" end="01:47:52.989" style="s2">Yes, and you&#39;d agree with this I think okay. I think that</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.050" end="01:47:56.050" style="s2">goes bro fear</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.219" end="01:48:04.538" style="s2">So, you know like being hypnotized for example, yeah you I&#39;ve never been hypnotized. Yeah me neither</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.760" end="01:48:09.820" style="s2">So what but then again, it&#39;s real what happens - so have you ever said a volunteer did not get that?</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.820" end="01:48:16.570" style="s2">Okay me neither same thing. So hypnotism from what I understand is you have to like be what he call like successful</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.209" end="01:48:20.229" style="s2">Open to it. Yeah open to it. Yeah, so if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.979" end="01:48:26.529" style="s2">Suggestible person that&#39;s like you have a certain kind of mind and then on top of that even more consciously</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.719" end="01:48:29.348" style="s2">You have to volunteer to be hypnotized a guy</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.349" end="01:48:35.049" style="s2">I mean, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s methods that you can sort of hypnotize someone without them knowing it or something but usually</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.039" end="01:48:40.509" style="s2">Even say I&#39;m sure but oh, yeah, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.110" end="01:48:45.039" style="s2">Right, you can even there&#39;s Owen and then or not nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.860" end="01:48:47.860" style="s2">usually the hypnotic</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.869" end="01:48:51.639" style="s2">Sequence goes through. Hey you volunteer like consciously. Yeah. Sure</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.639" end="01:48:55.299" style="s2">I&#39;ll be hypnotizing you sit there and you&#39;re up to ten and you&#39;re closing your eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.820" end="01:48:59.889" style="s2">Breathing anyway, so you consciously volunteered to be hypnotized</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.889" end="01:49:06.429" style="s2">So you&#39;re open to being hypnotized and then blah blah blah. So psychological warfare. It&#39;s like hey you recognize. Okay, I have this weakness</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.429" end="01:49:10.808" style="s2">I&#39;m about to skip this workout right now. You&#39;re basically saying hey, I need a help. I need nothing</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.809" end="01:49:12.819" style="s2">You know, I need a little spark volunteering for help</p>

<p begin="01:57:16.500" end="01:57:18.500" style="s2">Started out this podcast today</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.500" end="01:57:24.560" style="s2">Pretty heavy pretty rough. And I think it&#39;s important to remember</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.440" end="01:57:32.179" style="s2">Something that I always refer back to and that is that evil does exist in the world. It&#39;s out there and</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.820" end="01:57:35.480" style="s2">With that I&#39;d like to thank all the military personnel</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.179" end="01:57:37.920" style="s2">throughout the globe</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.920" end="01:57:45.109" style="s2">That stand up to evil in the world and thanks to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs</p>

<p begin="01:57:58.770" end="01:58:03.949" style="s2">If things are tough and I know they get tough life is hard</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.179" end="01:58:08.179" style="s2">But there&#39;s still reason to be thankful</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.449" end="01:58:11.479" style="s2">Be thankful. You&#39;re not in a gulag</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.290" end="01:58:19.759" style="s2">Be thankful that you&#39;re not being tortured be thankful that you have food to eat be thankful. You have a bed to sleep on</p>

<p begin="01:58:21.780" end="01:58:24.830" style="s2">Then do your best to watch out for those?</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.620" end="01:58:28.459" style="s2">Little seeds of evil that are planted</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.100" end="01:58:32.749" style="s2">around you and plant it in you and</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.560" end="01:58:37.700" style="s2">Keep those seeds of evil in check</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.510" end="01:58:43.700" style="s2">By going out into the world and doing good</p>
