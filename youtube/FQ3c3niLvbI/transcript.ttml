<p begin="00:00:06.080" end="00:00:09.760" style="s2">so john i thought we&#39;d start</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.839" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">kind of giving context about how you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:12.880" style="s2">i met</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">i was a student at the university of</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:15.759" style="s2">toronto and i actually never took one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">your classes</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.759" end="00:00:20.480" style="s2">but i was a student in your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:22.000" style="s2">sessions that you had a lunch break</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.480" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">which was great</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.000" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">and about maybe a year ago you came on</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">my podcast intellectual explorers</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:31.599" style="s2">and then when we had follow-up breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:33.520" style="s2">i&#39;m mentioning to you these different</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.599" end="00:00:35.200" style="s2">conversational modalities that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:38.239" style="s2">experiencing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.200" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">engaging in like uh verbal aikido</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.239" end="00:00:43.760" style="s2">circling um what is it like</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:44.800" style="s2">inside dialogue stuff like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:46.960" style="s2">you got captured</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.800" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">by that sort of conversation and then we</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.960" end="00:00:51.760" style="s2">decided to go on a research</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:52.239" style="s2">project together um kind of get not only</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.760" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.239" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">reading the primary material but</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">actually engaging in the practices</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">themselves so just kind of curious that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:01.280" style="s2">what is your sort of thoughts on this</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">journey so far that you and i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.280" end="00:01:03.920" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">so there was two things there was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.920" end="00:01:07.520" style="s2">criticism that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">jonathan pageau had made of my work a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">very good criticism you know that it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:13.280" style="s2">for all of my criticism of autodidactism</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:15.040" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t talking very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.280" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">about you know collective uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">and so shortly after jonathan made and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">you know jonathan&#39;s criticisms are</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:25.840" style="s2">always made</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">um in good faith um but um uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.840" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">shortly after he made that criticism you</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">and i spoke and that&#39;s why we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.720" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">like ah</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">and then as i got into doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">the the work with you and started</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2">reading some of the literature and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">starting to do some of the practices</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:41.200" style="s2">with you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">um this was starting to gel with</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.200" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">uh ideas that were emerging in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">conversation i was having</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">uh initially the and and importantly</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">because it was very provocative it was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">conversation i was having with jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">hall</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">and he i was trying to get understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">his notion of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">and then he proposed the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">metapsychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:01.360" style="s2">i was thinking that the metapsychotic</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">knowledge in the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">was dialectic which um</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">which you know and and and it has all</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">these dimens and i knew it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">and all these dimensions to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">i thought oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">so first of all jordan&#39;s idea hit me</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">like you know like that wow that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">and you know and there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">between the meta psycho technology for</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">and the meta heuristic for individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">wisdom cultivation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">and that was all the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">between those was was integral to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">um dialectic and so that sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">really grabbing me and i thought ah what</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">i want to do after</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis is i</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">want to start developing a series that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">explores that because i thought what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">could do is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">let&#39;s like let&#39;s really understand that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">very deeply and then bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">dialogue with all of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">emerging modalities and see if we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">you know create what jordan says we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">which is the metaphysical technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">that would coordinate with the meta</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">heuristic of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">and then of course you know the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">at rebel wisdom start taking up</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">this this idea you know uh about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">collective intelligence and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">important it is and so i just feel like</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t have any uh any beliefs about</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">destiny or t loss or anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">but it&#39;s like everything was everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">is just sort of really</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:23.440" style="s2">um you know folding together in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">sort of mutually</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">um affording fashion and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">time i i i</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">i&#39;m starting to uh you know participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">in more and more of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">conversations with jordan and with</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">with guy personally for me it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">expanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">in terms of like what&#39;s it mean for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">my own personal ecology of practices i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">trying to see how does it work with</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">things like lectio divina how does it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">work with the contemplative practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">how does it work with the moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">because you know a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.640" style="s2">modalities bring in embodiment bring in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.640" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">so bring in a new way of trying to even</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">relate to language</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">um so it&#39;s just been it&#39;s just been i</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">feel really really privileged</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">and again the timing for me is i want</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">i&#39;m on sabbatical</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">so i could just like i could just go</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">crazy on this it&#39;s just been wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">just wonderful and like one thing i just</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">want to like to send you gratitude and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">love your way</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">uh because you know dave and i were</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">talking about the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">and how some of that that dialogue there</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">just seems fossilized</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">people are kind of like attached to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">their viewpoints but</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">seeing you like dialogue with jordan</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">hall or</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">guy or in the in-person intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">explorers club</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">i see your insights in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">just those like aha moments that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">and i almost see you rewriting your map</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious like uh why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">that is for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">oh uh that&#39;s a really good question i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">well these are different aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">figure of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">and the practice that he had um so</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s very a socratic dialogue often</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">in an argumentative conclusion instead</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">what&#39;s often happened is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">you know eporia a kind of profound</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">insight that challenges people to change</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">uh to enter into an aspirational project</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">so um i&#39;ve from the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">i was interested in the connection</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:27.199" style="s2">inference and insight and so i developed</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">my teaching style and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.199" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">my way of doing scientific theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">in which i really tried to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">both insight</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">and inference together and then as i</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">developed mindfulness skills brought</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">those to bear</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">um and and so i very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">i i like i very much try to get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">i think it&#39;s often is into a flow state</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">teaching and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">that is often best afforded if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">more dialogic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">with my students and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">that got taken up into and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">in in these dialogues i&#39;m having with</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">people and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">that&#39;s really important to me and thank</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">you for for for what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a model that&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">in my mind um</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">and it goes to an argument that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">already been presenting in the series</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">intelligence and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">and that the way you get rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">by having intelligence to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">to sort of you know recursively applied</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">to itself</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">and improve its own application and one</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">of the hallmarks</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">of rationality is to care about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">as much if nf and at times more than the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">right it&#39;s the opposite of bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">and so what i&#39;m starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">is that and it&#39;s very good that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">starting to create psychotech</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">and practices for you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">coalescing and accentuating uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">collective intelligence but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">bring in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">the psychotech that gets that collective</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">intelligence into what i would call</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">rationality again i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">rationality doesn&#39;t mean logicality et</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">cetera it&#39;s it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">comprehensive notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">so and so moments of insight</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">are often very much about that when i</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">right where there&#39;s there&#39;s been like</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">sort of this going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">dialogue and then there&#39;s an insight and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.240" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">i it&#39;s like a problem reformulation</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.240" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not see the key to insight</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">what happens in insight is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">reformulating the problem you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">much more attention to how the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">is formulated</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">before you&#39;re going for the answer and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">so insight is when the dialogue is going</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">through something like a restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">or reformulation</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">process and that&#39;s an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">to to intervene for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">cultivating the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:07.280" style="s2">collective rationality although you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m working hard to try and open</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.280" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">the notion of rationality up to be much</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">but i sometimes are now i i now use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">word like</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">collective wisdom now because i&#39;m that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the sense of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">i i&#39;m trying to point towards so insight</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">is both personally uh optimizing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">moving into something like the flow</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">state but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">like and it&#39;s tapping into uh the stage</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve internalized socrates</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s also pointing forward to like</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">how are we gonna how how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">relate to and inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">the space of collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">reshape it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">so that we can start to we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">enact</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">collective wisdom and do what you see in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">the platonic dialogues turn that wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">central and important topics and issues</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">that concern human beings right</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">you said that struck me is that you said</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">the bottom line thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">and uh you know it seems like uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">what&#39;s neutered is the opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">us to gain insight in an intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">dynamic and i wanted to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">about like i it relating with martial</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">braun&#39;s term</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">environment which is sort of like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">they say game a</p>

<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">to get something so i&#39;m treating you as</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">term by uh see right mills i think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">marketing mentality it&#39;s not only am i</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">making you an instrument i&#39;m making</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sense like people wearing</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">a mask there&#39;s this existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">loneliness a hunger for something more</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">uh and this is prevalence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">yeah as an art form now</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">right um so yeah a convergence of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">yeah i mean so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">you know the iet or what from would call</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">the the having mode the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">categorical representation manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">control it&#39;s oriented around problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">solving</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">right and this is something i think we</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">should i&#39;m going to make a point that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">we should start refining our discourse</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">about this practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">um so i&#39;m going to make a proposal to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">you i often hear people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">the kind of practices</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">we&#39;re doing as being sort of motivated</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">by curiosity and i propose that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be using that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">i propose that we should be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">about wonder a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">and this is important because socrates</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">famously said that wisdom begins</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">in wonder because wonder puts wonder is</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">a state where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re opening up a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">so that you&#39;re confronting mystery</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">you&#39;re conf</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">you&#39;re calling into question yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">and your world so that they both can</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">undergo the restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">that you and i were talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">moment ago</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">and wonder can be deepened into awe</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">which is a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">you know has a powerful ability to to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">pull people</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">beyond their egocentrism that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">the you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">one of the features of awe is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">reliably is it takes people out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">egocentrism they feel humbled</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">right they get a sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean this majority by being put</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">in their place and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">and their that that their world view</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">their world and their self is too small</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">for the reality that they&#39;ve confronted</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">and i see what was happening in plato is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">you know you&#39;re trying to you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">to deepen wonder into awe and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">and get that going and that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">feel is happening when i&#39;m doing these</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">right whereas it&#39;s not curious i know</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">what curiosity&#39;s like and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">here&#39;s a pro you know here&#39;s a here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">gap in the knowledge and i run an</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">experiment and i try and close it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">you know that and that&#39;s important you</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">know it&#39;s how you get</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:16.959" style="s2">how you deal with ignorance but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">not trying to solve problems here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">uh i think in invoke um our</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">participation and wonder</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">so that we actually platform people</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">going through</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">a transformative process and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">i think we should in order to break out</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">of the eye</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">yet and get into i thou we need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">much more careful attention to the terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">and the states</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to inhabit i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">becoming more familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">participatory knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">wonder is a way of moving into an i thou</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">relationship where i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">confront</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">that space in which restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:01.839" style="s2">of identity both my identity and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">identities in the world is possible so</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.839" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">i can fulfill the developmental needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">that are central to the viewing mode</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">we need to start we need to start</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s part of why you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">doing what we&#39;re doing we need to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">more careful language</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">and more careful thought uh because</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">we&#39;re i think we should start</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">thinking about moving beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">inception stage</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">and and the promotion stage of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">modalities to as i said</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">can we start to integrate them with</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">good cognitive science and move them</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">in in a particular direction</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">there&#39;s this term that came up just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">there&#39;s wonder phobia in society at</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">it seems like um and you and i were</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">like experimenting with these modalities</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">and even like maybe experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">creating new</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">ones um and there&#39;s a sense that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">might be needs to be bridges</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">that we have to build like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">anti-debates that we&#39;re experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">here at the international explorers club</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">do you have any tuitions about how to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">um yeah i i i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">one one of the intuitions is uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">to get people to realize that it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">uh to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">see the words are so loaded but to enter</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">into argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">without entering into if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">this without entering into dispute</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">uh uh so what do i mean by that what i</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">is like uh getting people to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">the difference between opponent</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">processing and adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">processing right and so plato had a term</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">for this you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">philia sophia which is we come together</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">and we we each recognize we have bias</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">and then i realized that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">things your bias is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">really good for is pulling me out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">mind and vice versa and so we can fit</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">together we can do that opponent</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">and create a logos that has us doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">something we can&#39;t do for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">because our biases are trapping us and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">making us stuck but if we coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">them in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">we can actually call each other beyond</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">our biases</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s a point of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">processing and that that&#39;s that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">possibility for people</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">in contra in contrast to the mentality</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">of adversarial processing you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">fight with what plato called philly and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">ikea the love of victory</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">where so it&#39;s an adversarial winner take</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">all crush the opponent</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">because that attitude actually right</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">removes the possibility that that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.800" style="s2">you i think i and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">possibility is very much dependent on us</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.800" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">a kind of opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">the possibility of self-correction again</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">if people of people can</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">start to move to that idea that they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">right they can be in opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">without being adversaries</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">um and and so i think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">important thing that&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">bridge now what that looks like in terms</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">of a specific practice i&#39;m not i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">know yet i</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">like i see it happening in individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">uh conversations and dialogue where and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:07.920" style="s2">it often happens around when people will</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">bring this topic up for me they&#39;ll bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.920" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">it up</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">and then you can see that they they they</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.639" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">get it and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">they shift because they want to try they</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:18.959" style="s2">at least want to try it</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">and i i found it very powerful uh a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.959" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">of those times</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got we have to start</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">bringing bringing into it and if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">could get people to realize again</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">all right this sounds so trite right but</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">if we can get people to realize again</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">how much</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">we need each other uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">in this um as opposed to needing to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">um that that could be been a beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">bridge</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.839" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s like there is a sense that of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">fatigue i&#39;m noticing and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">term i quite like uh by scott aikens and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">robert tully&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">uh called the dialectic fallacy where</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s like this gesturing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">here to have uh you know a good faith</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">but really we&#39;re just trying to score</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">points with our tribe yeah right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">just trying to win</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">type of thing and and there&#39;s incentives</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">for why that is of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">uh but there&#39;s i think there&#39;s an area</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">to be playful here in</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">this idea of the anti-debate where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">sort of have this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">confrontational aspect about it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:18.799" style="s2">you&#39;re gamifying understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.199" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">to give people a taste of sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.799" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">an eye that way of relating well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">and i think the isla</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">relating right and bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">rationality as i would describe it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">about can we get people</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:31.760" style="s2">if we get them to understand opponent</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">processing can we get them back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.760" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">valuing the process for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">so i&#39;ve adopted some practices i do i</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:40.480" style="s2">you know okay how do i know if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:41.039" style="s2">really listening i know if i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.480" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">listening</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.039" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">if another person triggers an insight in</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">so so it&#39;s a marker for me if i if i can</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">go oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">restructuring and that didn&#39;t or</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">originate with me</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">that so i look for that and i try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">sensitize myself for it and i try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">i try to sort of as much as i can set</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">things up so people uh will feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">free to sort of be more playful and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">possibly afford an insight so i i do</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">i do something like that also i try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">of course not insincerely but where i</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">can step back</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">and exemplify self-correction and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">that was a mistake or that was imprecise</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">and where i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">trying to again do some sneaky sly</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">things so i can then trap you into</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">the conclusion i want you to come to but</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.320" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh right what i ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">want for this is to engage in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">of self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">this self-organizing self-correction now</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:45.919" style="s2">you have to be sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">where you&#39;re interacting like when i</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.919" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">there&#39;s certain arenas</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">where that confrontation has to be more</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">uh combative i mean like so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">in the scientific arena</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">like you have to come to conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">because for reasons of funding and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">publication and blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:04.720" style="s2">and that you know and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">accept that but if we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.720" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">if we&#39;re not so much pursuing knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.000" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">if you allow me this distinction but</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">cultivating wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">i think we can like we can shift over to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">trying to and i&#39;m not saying that what i</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">just proposed to you is exhausted this</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">is stuff i&#39;m just working out right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">but can we give people a list of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">that they can pay attention to that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">markers</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">that they&#39;re oriented to the process and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">they&#39;re in opponent processing rather</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">than adversarial combat so can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">explain what opponent processing means</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">yeah so uh let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">example uh from um</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">uh your own nervous system and the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">it connects you to the world and helps</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:47.200" style="s2">you cope and care about the world uh so</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">this is your autonomic notice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">self-governing that&#39;s what autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">your autonomic nervous system this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">this part of your system that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">regulating your level of arousal not</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">your sexual arousal</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">your level of arousal how much metabolic</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">energy are you expending</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">right now and the point is there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">algorithm for that because sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:08.320" style="s2">need to be really or</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">sometimes and you you can&#39;t be canadian</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.320" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">like just sort of middling all the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">so well what what and this is just an</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:15.840" style="s2">example you can see this in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">scales throughout</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">biology with like within your own uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">within your own uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">physiology but let&#39;s do it with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">autonomic nervous system so what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:25.919" style="s2">have is</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">it&#39;s divided into two subsystems there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">a sympathetic system and what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">it tries</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s biased it&#39;s biased it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.960" style="s2">interpret as much of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">as it can as as many stimuli as it can</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">it&#39;s indicating that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">arousal should be raised the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">parasympathetic system is the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to interpret as much of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">environment as it can it has a</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">opposite bias as no arousal should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">diminished and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">so they&#39;re working sort of opposite to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">each other they have opposite biases</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">but they&#39;re conjoined together causally</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">so as the sympathetic system tries to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">ramp up it tries to shut down</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">right it tries to down regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:05.080" style="s2">parasympathetic and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">so what that you got is this constantly</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.080" end="00:21:09.159" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">moment by moment fine-grained</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.159" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">self-organized recalibration</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">of right the best interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">environment and the most appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">level of arousal that you should have</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">couple and it&#39;s coupled together</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">and so that&#39;s opponent processing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">would be it would be insane</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">if like like if the sympathetic nervous</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">system no</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">my view is right what i have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">kill the parasite you would then die</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">and the capacity for self-correction and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">dynamically and fluidly</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">count recalibrating on the fly your</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">level of arousal</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">uh would would be lost i mean i was in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">conversation this morning and what one</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">of the people said oh yeah that would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">like cancer like where one set of cells</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">is now i&#39;m going to win at all costs and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">has stepped outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">of you know opponent processing into</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">adversarial so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">if we could if we if we could if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">could mimic</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">that right interpersonally what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">happening intrapersonally</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what i that&#39;s what i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">opponent processing so you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">sort of doing circling together on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.840" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">regular basis we&#39;re not just researching</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">we&#39;re practicing it participant</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">observation hopefully getting an</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">enough ethnography out of it right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">unlike</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">our last circling i&#39;ve had like insights</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">and it was powerful</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">and was interesting because there&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:25.919" style="s2">insights within</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s constitutive insights</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.919" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">that are in so i i&#39;ve argued elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">with leo ferraro and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">adrian harren bennett that flow is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">sort of an in</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">inside cascade i think i&#39;ve mentioned to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">guy this that i think what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">in circling</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">is you&#39;re trying to get a flow state</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">going in distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">and what so you get you get constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">insights these are insights that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">prompt the circling and keep it going</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">and then there&#39;s these meta insights</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">where you step back right like we do</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">when we&#39;re checking out or reflecting at</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">and you sort of you get insights about</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">the process itself you understand the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">difference here</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">between the constitutive insights that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">generate the flow and then the meta</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">insights where you sort of take away and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:02.159" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">i have an insight about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.159" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">there and and in our last circling i had</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">a pow i had both of those in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a very powerful degree so just for</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">have no idea what circling is and i know</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">uh david&#39;s interview guy</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">and you can watch videos on it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">really hard to describe like an elevator</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">pitch but</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:23.360" style="s2">what would you say uh circling is for</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">someone who&#39;s not really aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">people often use mindfulness but i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">they they use a meditative</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">analogy which i think isn&#39;t as good so</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">let me try an</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">analogy here because often if you give</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">people an analogy and then you you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">specified into</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">more technical terms so i&#39;m a tai chi</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">chan player seriously</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">right and you&#39;re always trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">this bi-directional awareness going they</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">talk about like having two eyes</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">so one is an awareness that&#39;s going deep</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">into your body</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">and into your mind not into your</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">thoughts but sort of tasting your mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">what it&#39;s what&#39;s its temperature</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">and texture and tempo so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this inner eye</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got an outer eye looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">out at the environment</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">and then you know the way your left and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">right visual fields do stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">fusion so you get depth perception</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">what you learn to do in tai chi is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">initially you&#39;re doing both of these and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">you&#39;re moving back and forth but</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">eventually you get that stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">fusion the inner</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">and the outer right fuse together and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">you that&#39;s part of how you cultivate she</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">and what you get then is uh this</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">this way in which you get very coupled</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">simultaneously to your embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">and then to the environment and then of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:38.400" style="s2">course you move and what you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.400" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">with the movements is you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">create um flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">because the the point of the movements</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">is they yin and yang they expand and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">contract</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">and your attention is expanding and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:51.679" style="s2">contracting and right and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">all of this is this is very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.679" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">uh to try and get you into a flow state</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:57.520" style="s2">and now i think the same thing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">happening in circling but instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.520" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">movements being</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:02.320" style="s2">movements of body there are largely</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">movements of discourse</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.320" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">so what&#39;s happening is you know you if</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">you to get into circling</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">uh you&#39;re you&#39;re bringing this inner</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">awareness a kind of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">but it is you&#39;re trying to get it fused</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">in this dynamic sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">with an outer awareness of what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">going on in other people and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">trying to make movements</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">that get that into a collective flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">so what happens often in circling is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">people they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re doing a thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">can see that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">they&#39;ll give a little bit more attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">to right what&#39;s going on inside</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">and then a little bit more out and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">they also do the zoom out what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">whole group</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">what&#39;s the individual and so i i find it</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">very analogous</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">uh to the practice of touch you because</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">the zooming out the zooming in and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the attempt to fuse</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">the outer awareness and the inner</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">awareness so they&#39;re mutually affording</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">each other and then this is all being</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">so you&#39;re getting something like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">collective flow state</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">that accesses and i think accentuates</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:06.640" style="s2">um the the power of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">cognition it engenders</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.640" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">collective intelligence right there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">to ground it for people</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">who might not have experienced it before</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">uh sometimes it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">intersubjective meditative practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">and you get in a circle an actual circle</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">and then you have these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">conversational</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">uh kind of experiences and they have</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">these neat little warm-up exercises yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">we do beforehand right</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">uh one of them i quite like is called</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">the imagination game and so we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">kind of sitting across from each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">and then i&#39;m imagining</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">something about your reality right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">yeah whether what you&#39;re feeling or what</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">and then i state it and then you confirm</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">that&#39;s true or false yes and then you do</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">it to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">and then if you do this back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">your intuition muscles gets quite strong</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">yeah you build up what segal called</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">mindsight and i built a little bit on</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">that on the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.400" style="s2">mine site resonance so mindset is your</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">ability to pick up um</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">on other people&#39;s mental states and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">what human beings</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">do um is and we&#39;re doing it now so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">i i start to pick up on your mental</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">state and then you start to give me cues</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">often embodied cues like the nod or as i</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">pick up on you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">you right give me cues to help me pick</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">up more on you and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">what i then do is i tailor my myself to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">allow you uh to pick up more on me and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">so what starts to happen is i read you</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">and then that helps me</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:26.399" style="s2">uh better present myself so you can read</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">me better and then you&#39;re reading me</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.399" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">and then you present and then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">resonate and so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">what what&#39;s happening with uh a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">the warm-up exercises for circling is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:39.120" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">uh mine site resonance right and um</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">because if i know your mental state it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">right i i&#39;m much more successful</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">at restructuring my communication so</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">you&#39;ll get me</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">and then vice versa we loop right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">there&#39;s like like you&#39;re saying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">insights that are flowing in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">sessions that we&#39;re having and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">you&#39;re dropping some amazing bombs</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">one of them that happened the last</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">session uh you had to play on words of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">peer</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">yeah right so if uh you&#39;re someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">peer you have the the capacity to peer</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">through them</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">but you&#39;re also allowing them to peer</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">through you yes and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">that that that play so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">playfulness that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">so that was one of the like yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">like it was like a constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">uh like that really that really helped</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">me stay in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">uh i also i that very same time i had</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">i had that what i would call a meta you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">i met an insight because i was coming to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">the realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">uh well i had the experience that when</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">when you&#39;re in when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">circling people that you get that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">salience glow that you&#39;re in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.120" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">state or when people are in psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">experience right and so i asked other</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">people it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">it was that the case and you were there</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">and other people saying yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">and then there was a report that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">this is often reported and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">and i thought okay well i know what</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">psilocybin is doing on the brain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">getting areas of the brain to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">that don&#39;t normally talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">and i was one and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s a big there&#39;s all the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">scanning synchrony studies when people</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">are doing this interpersonal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">the brain starts they start</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">synchronizing in important ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">so i would you know i i i&#39;m not claiming</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">this is the case but</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">this is a really interesting hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">to explore</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">that what&#39;s happening is circling gets</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">patterns of connection to be novel and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">restructured</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">and we&#39;re and we&#39;re communicating in</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">ways we don&#39;t normally do</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">and then that gets internalized as areas</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">talking and communicating to each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">in ways they don&#39;t normally do and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">that feeds back out to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">help the restructuring of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">interpersonal and then that feeds back</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">to help the restructuring of the inter</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">and then you get that loop going and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve already got a mine site resonance</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">going you could see why that would</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">loop so powerfully right and um like</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">what comes to mind is this this circling</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">in particular it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">a gym to practice truthfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">daniel schmuckenberger had this</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.880" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">interesting distinction between you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">truth versus truthfulness where truth is</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">like the correspondence theory of truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">your map of reality accurately maps over</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">to reality so it&#39;s like you arrived in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">where truthfulness is that process the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">ongoing process of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">and one&#39;s a property and the other uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">the other is an ideal right</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">and and then this mapping process it</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:21.440" style="s2">sort of it localizes it in circling to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">the immediate moment where your felt</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.440" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">senses your thoughts and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s very good i mean but</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">one of the things i would like</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">i suppose for our project</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t want to mess with</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">circling it is what it is and it has the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">values it does</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">and i want to continue practicing it but</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">it would be nice if we could</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">if we could bring like so in tai chi</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">if if all i&#39;m ever doing is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">reflecting on my</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">right then i can&#39;t actually ever like i</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">couldn&#39;t ever spar</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">say is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">yes we get all this coordination going</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">and we come into the present moment but</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">you have to be able to come into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">present moment so you can do</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">something there other than find another</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">present moment that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">you like that&#39;s what the so if you&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">with the the tai chi metaphor and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:18.159" style="s2">is what i see happening in socratic doll</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.159" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">you know socrates will say did you did</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">you do you believe that right now or did</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:25.840" style="s2">you just hear somebody say that if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">just heard somebody say it don&#39;t say it</p>

<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">socrates is doing that but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">doing it just to keep people in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">present moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">he&#39;s keeping him in the present moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">getting this loop that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">about going</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">so then they can then turn that like</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like i feel sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a worry like you know we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re building this powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">machine and then we&#39;re just looking look</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">at how beautifully it runs</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">look at that what you know let&#39;s oil it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">some more let&#39;s oh and so it&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">better and better</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">and you have to do that you have to care</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">about but like what do we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">what i want to do with this right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">and is it would be nice like i say if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">could use it</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">if we could if we could if we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:13.120" style="s2">collective intelligence up into</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:15.760" style="s2">collective rationality and then we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.120" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">turn that powerful self-correcting</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.760" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">insightful</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">machine of your llama this analogy onto</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">issues like what is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">what is a good life what is meaning like</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">that we need to have good discussions</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">about right now because all of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">things have fallen into impoverishment</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the things driving the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">meaning crisis but we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">like we could re revitalize them in</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">really powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">and so you and i have sort of a like</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">to-do list of all these modalities to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">check out</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">so we&#39;re engaging in circling right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.279" style="s2">we have something of insight dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">we have empathy circles restorative</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.279" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">circles by dominic barter</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">and my read is that all these are</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">deliciously incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">yes you know and we&#39;re getting a taste</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">of them but they&#39;re hyper focused on one</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">thing one&#39;s on empathy one&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">connecting</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">yeah and you mentioned this in uh the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">last time you came to the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">explorers club is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">like a call to arms for like</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.039" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">philosophers and scientists but also</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">artists and entrepreneurs to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:17.519" style="s2">play with this and see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">discover something new</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.519" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">yeah totally i mean and again um</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">not to hammer on this point but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:25.279" style="s2">exactly also what you see in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">socratic</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">right dialogues socrates oh well he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">talk to philosophers he&#39;ll talk to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">parmenides or</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">but he&#39;ll talk he also talks to generals</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">like he talks to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">well i think these issues in one sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">are philosophically profound</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">i think they are philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">profound not in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">academic uh conceptual clarification or</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">i think they&#39;re philosophically profound</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">in the in the ancient sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">in which they concern trying to get an</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">right an understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">that can really help people aspire as i</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">said to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">to wisdom and to enhancing meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">life and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">i think um you know if we&#39;re going if</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">effective it has to help like what</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">socrates does it has to be able to reach</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">everybody who wants to be less</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">more connected and i i this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">platonic</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">conceit on my part i think that deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">down everybody does</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">want that um and so yeah i think very</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">um we&#39;ve got it we&#39;ve got to engineer</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">this and reverse engineer</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">uh this so they can do exactly that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">we can say look we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">we need this term is so uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">so our terms like well this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">need right so many of our terms have</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">emptied and rendered thin but but we we</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">need a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">you know cognitive diversity so that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">can enrich</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">the ecology of practices as much as</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">possible so that the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">of right the abilities that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">seeking are</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">are optimally afforded that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what we need we need we need a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">lot of people involved</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">right and it&#39;s like it&#39;s not just you</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">in one of the videos that he did with uh</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:05.359" style="s2">that so uh i&#39;m not i&#39;m not making any</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">accusations i&#39;m i&#39;m saying</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">i think are urgent they&#39;re exigent</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">that practice generates stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">as a way of life as you know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:49.119" style="s2">eventually reaches to the height</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">of the roman that the emperor become</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">like a stoic philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s like so i run the stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">toronto group here and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">and i try to practice dosing as best as</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">we&#39;re having a discussion on what does</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:06.560" style="s2">the stoa mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">right a stol is this place not versus</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.560" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">stoics talk and you know they can</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">you know just geek out about stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a place where anyone can come to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">philosophize about what&#39;s most important</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a roman emperor</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">or you&#39;re a roman slave like marcus</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">yeah exactly exactly and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">then and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">and the dialectic also gets taken up</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">in into the church because you when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">like how does thomas aquinas write he</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">writes like a dot</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">in dialectic form where there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">question and answers and back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">that gets taken up into so these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">have the potential to be fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">uh like capable of fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">the the cultural cognitive grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">major institutions</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">like the emperor or like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">the pope</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">right like so that&#39;s what i&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">i mean wow that&#39;s really hubristic right</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">but that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s what i want as a as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">of the aristocrats um sitting in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">salons</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">discussing things endlessly right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">you mentioned the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">meta crisis and how i hold that is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">we&#39;re faced as a species with all these</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">existential risks that are incon</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">interconnected with each other uh you</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">know whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">economy or the environment or agi</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">and coupled with that is our inability</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">to sense make the is an odd of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.599" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">yes right and and sort of all these sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">of minimatic tribes that uh i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">tracking through the culture wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">term by the way great</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">thank you for giving us that thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:42.960" style="s2">um whether it&#39;s extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">or effective altruism or some of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.960" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">reactionary tribes when they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">the black pill</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re all looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">same reality the same meta crisis but</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">they&#39;re hyper focused on one area</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">they&#39;re not talking to each other right</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">so this is like what you get in children</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">according to piaget you have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">um like there&#39;s a kind of fixation</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">so what development often means is</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">right opening up the number of variables</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">that you find relevant and salient and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not just about that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">primarily a belief thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a perspectival participatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a developmental thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">right opening up the number of variables</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">and how they&#39;re related in order to stop</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">falling prey to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:26.079" style="s2">a certain kind of bias and so i hope i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">hoping</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">that what we can do is get people to to</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">and to that right where no no</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">there&#39;s like the way i was describing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">to you notice there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to in the phenomenology i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:42.160" style="s2">trying to pick out what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:44.960" style="s2">dimensions going on in dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.160" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">right and and how can we how can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.960" end="00:39:47.440" style="s2">teach people to coordinate them so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">the kid that goes from centration to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">adult they can pay attention to multiple</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">variables like</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">as the child is to the adult the adult</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">is to the sage that&#39;s one of the you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">know the ways of understanding wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s what that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">right and when we were talking last time</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">i mentioned it seems like to me you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">operating in two intellectual ecologies</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">right now one in the academic essence</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">you&#39;re doing formal research</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">and then there&#39;s sort of this wild west</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">i like that too but yeah yeah and in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">wild west is sort of what you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">doing this research in the strange</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:21.839" style="s2">attractor there seems to be this</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">authentic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.839" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">you know this is like the antidote to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">the meta crisis yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">well i think i think there&#39;s there&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">mean i think there&#39;s deep reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">uh i mean i so what the what the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">academic</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">research is showing is like what what</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">are the kinds of things that actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">contribute to the people&#39;s uh a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">and i so i think what people are</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">looking for when they&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">i i i find the term authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">problematic uh but</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">what people are looking for when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">looking for i&#39;m gonna use it in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">title of the series but</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">what people are looking for is as</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">a form of discourse that brings in all</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">of these levels</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">like all these kinds of knowings so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">underneath the communication there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.960" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">communing because</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">people need to feel a deep connected a</p>

<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">right and it also is flow affording if</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">we&#39;re connecting that way other than</p>

<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">is how often you have flow in it because</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:24.480" style="s2">you again it&#39;s the sense of being really</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">and i think why that&#39;s important because</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">i think well i argue</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:33.599" style="s2">that the mental fog that is preventing</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">right is the meaning crisis we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">we&#39;re in scarcity mental</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">and so it just it just it&#39;s like you get</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">lot you&#39;re like the kid you centrate and</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">that is necessary for reformulating and</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">the problem in a way we need to solve we</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">like you know</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">like a diagram and you look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like a bought and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">it flips right all the information is</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">there what changes isn&#39;t the information</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">what changes</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">is what&#39;s salient what what aspects come</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">forward what aspects received</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">and where we need we need an aspect</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what and i think people have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:57.920" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s got to be an</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">aspect shift coming from collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.920" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">intelligence the kind of restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:04.000" style="s2">that you and i have been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">and just to use the the simple metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.000" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">of the you know the blind men and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">elephant</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">yeah we all have our hands on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">elephant but we&#39;re not talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">other we&#39;re yelling at each other</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">so how do we get into dialogue with each</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">other but if i if i would have if i were</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">to understand that i&#39;m in one spot</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">and i had therefore of a bias this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">again kids kids who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">egocentric and what you have to do as an</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">adult is learn that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">you know you are seeing this room</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">differently than i am right now and take</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">that into consideration as i move around</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">or as i&#39;m talking to you you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">something analogous there it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">well you know i know that i&#39;m biased and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">i know you&#39;re a boss but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">things your bias can do is call me out</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">of my bios</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">and we were talking earlier about how</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">both of us feel kind of pulled</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:46.720" style="s2">towards this whatever this is um and i</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">just want to say that i&#39;m incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.720" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">grateful for being</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">pulled alongside it with you my friend</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">oh thank you very much my friend</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">me too i mean i i mean i i think this</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">goes back</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">to something primordial i like</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">i want to challenge the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">individualism this which is different by</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">the way from individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">which is uh you know a moral requirement</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:09.920" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">but the idea that we&#39;re all self-made is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.920" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">ridiculous because what actually made us</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">so able to kill it i mean look at us</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">individually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.079" end="00:44:20.480" style="s2">we&#39;re fragile and kind of badly designed</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">as animals we don&#39;t have good claws</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.480" end="00:44:23.440" style="s2">we&#39;re not particularly fast we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">standing in this way in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.440" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">always perpetually falling</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">exposing our throat and and our vital</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">organs to predation</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">well what do we have well what we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">is we can coordinate together sharpen</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:35.599" style="s2">some sticks and get some dogs and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">we can kill anything on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.599" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">what made us so powerful was this</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">ability to tap</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">into collective intelligence and</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s our great ability our adaptive</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">across speciation was our ability to</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">and create you know distributed</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">to to to achieving goals that are far</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">of us as individuals there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">been recent research</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">right where they&#39;ve taken they&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">rat brains the sounds are welling but</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">and they&#39;ve actually linked them</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">together electronically</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">and the bra the rats are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">solving problems that the individual</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">rats can&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s been some recent experiments</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">humans this is how this you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.480" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">distributed cognition and the power of</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">collective intelligence is a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">and i think because it was you know our</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">advantage across</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">species across speciation in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">we are wired to find to seek it out and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">to find it inherently valuable</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">and deeply motivating and deeply</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">and and so like i think like</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.440" end="00:45:55.119" style="s2">religions were were masterful at this</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">like</p>

<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">were able to do was to take that</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">need i would argue if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">bring about the restructuring the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">fundamental aspect shift we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to address the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">crisis in such a way that&#39;s why i use</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">the word awakening</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">not solving it&#39;s an aspect shift out of</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">which it&#39;s fogging our mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">so that we can get to the mental</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.720" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">flexibility the mental wherewithal</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">so that we can restructure and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">reformulate the metacrisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.640" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve been talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">sense of urgency with this project as</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">we&#39;re going to kill ourselves i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">uh i was talking to david the other day</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">about this i think there&#39;s sort of two</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">senses of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s the existential</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">urgency and then there&#39;s what i would</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">call chirotic</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">urgency there&#39;s a kairos here and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">got we</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">and kairos is they they that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why spirit is the wind</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">it comes and goes as it will who has</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">seen the wind neither you nor i</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">right but you know but what is it when</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">the trees are bowing down</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">the wind is passing by or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:29.200" style="s2">famous poem is but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">it comes and goes as it will jesus says</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.200" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">that in the gospels too</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">the kyros is here i think that&#39;s but we</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">can&#39;t count</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">on it staying it will it it&#39;s spiritus</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">it will come and go as it will and if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">don&#39;t get the spiritual sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:47.839" style="s2">to pick up on it we&#39;ll lose it</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:49.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s also that urgency and the two</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.839" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">urgencies are not</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.200" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">independent of each other they</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">accelerate and exacerbate each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">if you like that video i&#39;ll be using</p>
