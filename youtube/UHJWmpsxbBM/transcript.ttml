<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">sort of a to put it simply like a way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">being and then there&#39;s authentic</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.710" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">I&#39;d say it&#39;s largely considered as</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">circling is an authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:10.280" style="s2">practice so for us when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">authentic relating or what we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.280" end="00:02:13.370" style="s2">or what we mean when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:16.370" style="s2">authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.370" end="00:02:17.810" style="s2">is what we&#39;re striving for with our</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.370" end="00:02:20.269" style="s2">authenticity z&#39; that our outward</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.810" end="00:02:23.269" style="s2">expression i&#39;m more accurately reflects</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.269" end="00:02:25.819" style="s2">our inner experience that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.269" end="00:02:27.530" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of getting at is you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.819" end="00:02:31.400" style="s2">another way of looking at looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.530" end="00:02:33.110" style="s2">that as maybe transparency so something</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.400" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">about that doesn&#39;t quite fit so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.110" end="00:02:40.099" style="s2">really like how much are we able to were</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:42.590" style="s2">willing to put into words to express</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.099" end="00:02:44.150" style="s2">what we&#39;re experiencing when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:45.590" style="s2">relationship with somebody else whether</p>

<p begin="00:04:46.430" end="00:04:52.730" style="s2">trainings just because the amount of</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.470" end="00:05:09.650" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:11.900" style="s2">talk about circling maybe explain for us</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.650" end="00:05:14.720" style="s2">what it is but so you said circling is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.900" end="00:05:16.640" style="s2">part of authentic relating do you do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:18.620" style="s2">circling the main part of your your</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.640" end="00:05:20.780" style="s2">business so to speak or do you do do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.620" end="00:05:23.150" style="s2">do events and activities outside of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.780" end="00:05:26.570" style="s2">circling yeah we definitely do things</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.150" end="00:05:28.970" style="s2">outside is circling much like the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.570" end="00:05:30.580" style="s2">experiment the project and dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.970" end="00:05:33.830" style="s2">that Joan and I were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.580" end="00:05:35.780" style="s2">currently running that under authentic</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.830" end="00:05:38.480" style="s2">relating Toronto although I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.780" end="00:05:40.310" style="s2">if it will stay there that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.480" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">decided but it&#39;s been really good to use</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.310" end="00:05:45.500" style="s2">people that have these circling</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:49.760" style="s2">capacities into this just new type of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.500" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">conversation but in terms of circling an</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.760" end="00:05:54.050" style="s2">authentic leading practice yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:56.260" style="s2">say that&#39;s circling like one way to look</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.050" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">at is circling as sort of the marathon</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.260" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of the main event and to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:03.590" style="s2">authentic relating practice is going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">the gym and working the muscles so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.590" end="00:06:08.300" style="s2">you can do the the marathon the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:10.190" style="s2">framing I usually hold for authentic</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.300" end="00:06:12.200" style="s2">relating practices it&#39;s you know you go</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.190" end="00:06:14.870" style="s2">to a gym to sort of work on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.200" end="00:06:17.060" style="s2">physical fitness to me authentic</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.870" end="00:06:22.810" style="s2">relating is going into a gym to work</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.060" end="00:06:26.120" style="s2">your emotional interior self awareness</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.810" end="00:06:28.130" style="s2">muscles so we&#39;ll do a particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.120" end="00:06:30.370" style="s2">experiment it has various constraints</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.130" end="00:06:33.380" style="s2">like a piece of equipment in a gym would</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.370" end="00:06:35.690" style="s2">and sometimes some of the gym equipment</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.380" end="00:06:38.090" style="s2">feels really weird and contrived and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.690" end="00:06:39.710" style="s2">like really restrictive but you know it</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.090" end="00:06:42.710" style="s2">you do the motion and you keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.710" end="00:06:43.700" style="s2">you get stronger in that area so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.710" end="00:06:45.620" style="s2">sort of the frame that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.700" end="00:06:48.890" style="s2">holding for a long time and then when</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.620" end="00:06:52.490" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you know this great physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.890" end="00:06:55.190" style="s2">or emotional fitness then I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.490" end="00:06:57.710" style="s2">available encircling is is almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.190" end="00:06:58.600" style="s2">limitless so that&#39;s one frame I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.710" end="00:07:02.120" style="s2">hold for it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.600" end="00:07:07.340" style="s2">so so so are there other but what other</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.120" end="00:07:12.650" style="s2">activities other than circling would one</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.340" end="00:07:14.210" style="s2">do in these in these sessions yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.650" end="00:07:17.600" style="s2">the type of events that we have that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.210" end="00:07:20.360" style="s2">aren&#39;t circling specific we run events</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.600" end="00:07:22.940" style="s2">called tea groups which is sort a short</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.360" end="00:07:25.310" style="s2">for training groups which comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.940" end="00:07:28.490" style="s2">sensitivity training groups from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.310" end="00:07:31.250" style="s2">1950s and 60s so that&#39;s been around for</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.490" end="00:07:35.420" style="s2">a while to the highly present moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.250" end="00:07:37.460" style="s2">based exercise and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.420" end="00:07:40.130" style="s2">intention of that exercise is to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.460" end="00:07:43.130" style="s2">start to notice the impact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.130" end="00:07:45.590" style="s2">on others through being stubbornly</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.130" end="00:07:47.480" style="s2">committed to the present moment so</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.590" end="00:07:48.950" style="s2">that&#39;s one type of practice that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.480" end="00:07:50.750" style="s2">been doing for a while we&#39;re one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.950" end="00:07:53.390" style="s2">few authentic relating communities in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.750" end="00:07:58.100" style="s2">the world that seem to be consistently</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.390" end="00:08:01.760" style="s2">doing T group and I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.100" end="00:08:04.180" style="s2">great sort of feather in the cap you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.760" end="00:08:06.680" style="s2">know to use John&#39;s phrasing a great</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.180" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">practice for an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.680" end="00:08:12.350" style="s2">that would help you say better at</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:14.120" style="s2">circling and then we learn things called</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.350" end="00:08:16.130" style="s2">connection labs which I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.120" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">just general authentic relating practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.130" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">where we do sort of a series of small</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:24.380" style="s2">exercises you can call them experiments</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:26.390" style="s2">in sort of relating we might do that in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.380" end="00:08:28.790" style="s2">pairs you might do it in triads as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.390" end="00:08:30.590" style="s2">whole group but we usually do an evening</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.790" end="00:08:32.570" style="s2">of that and run through you know a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.590" end="00:08:34.910" style="s2">half-dozen different exercises</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.570" end="00:08:37.990" style="s2">sometimes around a theme you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.910" end="00:08:40.630" style="s2">the themes depth maybe the themes</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.990" end="00:08:44.120" style="s2">sexuality maybe the themes awkwardness</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.630" end="00:08:46.340" style="s2">and we just sort of orient the exercises</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.120" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">around people having those experiences</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.340" end="00:08:52.840" style="s2">in relationship with one another and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2">recently back in December I started</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.840" end="00:08:58.280" style="s2">making workshops which is not something</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">that we offered before and I managed to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.280" end="00:09:04.550" style="s2">create two new workshops one and as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:06.650" style="s2">introduction to shadow work and I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.550" end="00:09:08.570" style="s2">going to I started working on the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.650" end="00:09:12.050" style="s2">one and then the pandemic sort of was</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.570" end="00:09:14.150" style="s2">coming online and I decided to do an</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.050" end="00:09:16.610" style="s2">actual proper introduction to authentic</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.150" end="00:09:19.160" style="s2">relating Toronto that we&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.610" end="00:09:20.690" style="s2">had you know people sort of come in they</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.160" end="00:09:22.190" style="s2">might come in from circling because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.690" end="00:09:23.720" style="s2">heard about circling or they might come</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.190" end="00:09:25.610" style="s2">in through connection lab and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.720" end="00:09:27.770" style="s2">they&#39;ll never attend circling it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.610" end="00:09:29.780" style="s2">actually kind of interesting how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.770" end="00:09:31.700" style="s2">happens and some people just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.780" end="00:09:32.930" style="s2">really understand like they&#39;ll all get</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.700" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">emails like how do I become a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.930" end="00:09:38.030" style="s2">facilitator like I don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:39.530" style="s2">do this work and I guess whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.030" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">have on our websites just not clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.530" end="00:09:44.840" style="s2">enough so I wanted to sort of really</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:47.750" style="s2">clarify our message and what our</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.840" end="00:09:52.820" style="s2">intention is and what&#39;s available so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.750" end="00:09:54.290" style="s2">that&#39;s still in process but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.820" end="00:09:57.500" style="s2">getting a lot clearer about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.290" end="00:10:01.310" style="s2">up to so my last question before I open</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.500" end="00:10:04.610" style="s2">it up so so John talked quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.310" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">about circling in in awaking me from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.610" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">meaning crisis but he he doesn&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:12.350" style="s2">that much detail some people here may</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:14.090" style="s2">have more or less an awareness of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.350" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">certainly is but could you just take us</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.090" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">through what what is circling</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:32.390" style="s2">I said is that the end of our hour yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.540" end="00:10:34.070" style="s2">yeah yeah when we do an intro a night</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.390" end="00:10:35.720" style="s2">and we introduce people due to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.070" end="00:10:37.280" style="s2">practice it generally takes an hour</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.720" end="00:10:39.980" style="s2">before a ready to actually start doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.280" end="00:10:41.720" style="s2">the practice I&#39;ll take I&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.980" end="00:10:45.130" style="s2">little stab at it that hopefully doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.720" end="00:10:48.050" style="s2">take too long I&#39;ll keep it a bit generic</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.130" end="00:10:50.450" style="s2">so the type of circling that we we tend</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.050" end="00:10:52.760" style="s2">to offer in our drop-in events is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.450" end="00:10:56.810" style="s2">called birthday circling it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.760" end="00:10:58.010" style="s2">facilitated practice and somebody sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.810" end="00:11:00.290" style="s2">of volunteers to have the group&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.010" end="00:11:01.940" style="s2">attention and we keep bringing our</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.290" end="00:11:04.580" style="s2">attention like they become the focus of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.940" end="00:11:06.070" style="s2">our attention and what we&#39;re attempting</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.580" end="00:11:08.440" style="s2">to do is</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.070" end="00:11:11.470" style="s2">you sort of get and so much as we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.440" end="00:11:14.440" style="s2">get what it&#39;s like to be them right here</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.470" end="00:11:16.750" style="s2">right now with us and we do that by</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.440" end="00:11:18.850" style="s2">asking them what it&#39;s like to be with us</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.750" end="00:11:21.790" style="s2">and we share the impact of what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">like for us to be with them so we sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.790" end="00:11:28.420" style="s2">of start to notice what&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:30.100" style="s2">between us in the present moment another</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.420" end="00:11:32.890" style="s2">way to put it is it&#39;s an inter</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.100" end="00:11:34.030" style="s2">subjective meditative practice meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.890" end="00:11:37.720" style="s2">we&#39;re generally talking about our</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.030" end="00:11:40.180" style="s2">subjective first-person experience from</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.720" end="00:11:42.430" style="s2">the interior and it&#39;s a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.180" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">because we&#39;re noticing what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.430" end="00:11:47.380" style="s2">in us during the circle we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:49.510" style="s2">information about what&#39;s happening for</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.380" end="00:11:52.570" style="s2">the circle we and the others in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.510" end="00:11:54.970" style="s2">circle and we also start to notice the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.570" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2">space between us or the the we space or</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.970" end="00:11:59.530" style="s2">the collective space so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.920" end="00:12:01.080" style="s2">meditative part of it that&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.530" end="00:12:03.940" style="s2">best I can do in a couple minutes</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.080" end="00:12:07.030" style="s2">great well thank you very much so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.940" end="00:12:10.620" style="s2">open it up to two questions who has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.030" end="00:12:10.620" style="s2">question for Taylor</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.329" end="00:12:26.439" style="s2">don&#39;t be shy just just throw them out</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.239" end="00:12:29.449" style="s2">there Taylor I was wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.439" end="00:12:32.059" style="s2">circling in general you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.449" end="00:12:36.170" style="s2">is the end goal like what things do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.059" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">think circling helps with alright that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.170" end="00:12:40.069" style="s2">sort of an I mean it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:42.799" style="s2">and then the question makes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.069" end="00:12:44.839" style="s2">sense one thing I want to sort of say</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.799" end="00:12:46.249" style="s2">about is when I talk about circling I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.839" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">sort of gotten this feedback and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.249" end="00:12:49.339" style="s2">not specific to me I&#39;ve heard other</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:51.399" style="s2">people say it about other circling</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.339" end="00:12:54.199" style="s2">leaders is that we sound sort of vague</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.399" end="00:12:55.850" style="s2">and there&#39;s like this suspicion from</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.199" end="00:13:00.170" style="s2">some people not everybody that like</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.850" end="00:13:04.249" style="s2">we&#39;re like hiding something and I could</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.170" end="00:13:06.739" style="s2">talk a bit though sort of why we do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.249" end="00:13:09.879" style="s2">in a way and but it sort of depends on</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.739" end="00:13:12.470" style="s2">what frame were sort of holding about</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.879" end="00:13:15.199" style="s2">about sort of how we experience things</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.470" end="00:13:19.899" style="s2">and how we experience reality and things</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.199" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">like that but what I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.899" end="00:13:28.519" style="s2">the the most simple answer I can give I</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:32.679" style="s2">think for circling about what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.519" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">wanting for people in the practice is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.679" end="00:13:40.569" style="s2">freedom and what I mean by that is sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:44.540" style="s2">of like the day of choice that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.569" end="00:13:47.329" style="s2">notice their subjective patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.540" end="00:13:50.899" style="s2">start to create choice to move it more</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.329" end="00:13:52.459" style="s2">into the objective so I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.899" end="00:13:53.809" style="s2">sort of the thing that I wish for</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.459" end="00:13:56.299" style="s2">everybody and that I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.809" end="00:13:57.649" style="s2">practice is really good at doing like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.299" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">lot of people will do circling because</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.649" end="00:14:03.649" style="s2">they get reflections back like a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:05.749" style="s2">about what we call the water you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.649" end="00:14:07.999" style="s2">swimming in sort of highlighting the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.749" end="00:14:10.040" style="s2">blind spots of our way of being and how</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.999" end="00:14:16.119" style="s2">we&#39;re impacting people which is why I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.040" end="00:14:20.600" style="s2">think T group is a great associative</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.119" end="00:14:23.869" style="s2">practice to circling but what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.600" end="00:14:27.799" style="s2">doing in the moment is we&#39;re just trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.869" end="00:14:29.089" style="s2">to me more fully here and present so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.799" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">know there&#39;s that I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.089" end="00:14:30.950" style="s2">that&#39;s saying I think it&#39;s attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:32.360" style="s2">allow so</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.950" end="00:14:34.850" style="s2">but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.360" end="00:14:37.280" style="s2">actually his there&#39;s that saying that if</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.850" end="00:14:40.190" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re worried you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.280" end="00:14:41.570" style="s2">in the past or sorry know if you&#39;re yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.190" end="00:14:42.980" style="s2">if you&#39;re depressed you&#39;re living in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.570" end="00:14:44.990" style="s2">past if you&#39;re anxious you&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.980" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">the future but if you&#39;re at peace you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.990" end="00:14:53.660" style="s2">in the present moment and you know early</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.120" end="00:14:56.060" style="s2">on after I I found circling after my my</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.660" end="00:15:01.190" style="s2">wife or my then-girlfriend sort of had</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.060" end="00:15:03.590" style="s2">showed or introduced me to this I I read</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.190" end="00:15:07.420" style="s2">a book called a guide to the present</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.590" end="00:15:10.100" style="s2">moment no particularly popular author</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.420" end="00:15:12.980" style="s2">but what I really just sort of got from</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.100" end="00:15:14.870" style="s2">that is there&#39;s that idea of the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.980" end="00:15:16.850" style="s2">of happiness and some argument about</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.870" end="00:15:18.860" style="s2">whether or not that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.850" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">pursuit something that you should</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.860" end="00:15:24.380" style="s2">actually pursue but what I noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:26.150" style="s2">through reading that book and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.380" end="00:15:29.180" style="s2">mapping it out to my experience as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.150" end="00:15:34.130" style="s2">circling in the early days of it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.180" end="00:15:35.960" style="s2">that it seems like happiness like in its</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.130" end="00:15:40.340" style="s2">purest form is only available in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.960" end="00:15:44.270" style="s2">present moment so I think circling is is</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.340" end="00:15:47.540" style="s2">a way to help us get really present</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.270" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">really aware of what&#39;s here between any</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.540" end="00:15:53.090" style="s2">sized group of people to really get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:55.970" style="s2">the deepest truth of the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.090" end="00:15:58.910" style="s2">there&#39;s just something extremely freeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.970" end="00:16:01.300" style="s2">and for a lot of people although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.910" end="00:16:04.520" style="s2">not our general orientation to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.300" end="00:16:07.010" style="s2">steer people toward it in this way but a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.520" end="00:16:10.850" style="s2">very spiritual experience for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.010" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">people so yeah there&#39;s a sort of quality</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.850" end="00:16:16.070" style="s2">of experience that can be had in</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:19.700" style="s2">circling and I think that&#39;s why a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.070" end="00:16:21.140" style="s2">people continue to do it there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.700" end="00:16:23.630" style="s2">that introspection learning about</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.140" end="00:16:26.150" style="s2">themselves and then there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.630" end="00:16:27.860" style="s2">different way of being with other people</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.150" end="00:16:30.100" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t really know was</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.860" end="00:16:30.100" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.690" end="00:16:42.180" style="s2">hey Taylor thanks for doing this I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.960" end="00:16:44.460" style="s2">a theory that almost everyone with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.180" end="00:16:46.170" style="s2">name similar to Tyler turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.460" end="00:16:51.210" style="s2">pretty swell person can you confirm or</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.170" end="00:16:53.640" style="s2">deny this well considering that I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.210" end="00:16:56.580" style="s2">referred to as Tyler for most of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.640" end="00:16:59.400" style="s2">childhood yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.580" end="00:17:01.140" style="s2">fantastic so when I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.400" end="00:17:04.620" style="s2">easiest ways to alleviate the potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.140" end="00:17:07.339" style="s2">fears that any new practice may brush up</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.620" end="00:17:09.810" style="s2">against is to outline some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.339" end="00:17:12.060" style="s2">negative effects that we may have seen</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.810" end="00:17:14.069" style="s2">unfold from them are there any serious</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.060" end="00:17:16.439" style="s2">complaints that people may have had once</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.069" end="00:17:18.329" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone through the process or any</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.439" end="00:17:21.930" style="s2">noticeable negative effects that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.329" end="00:17:27.110" style="s2">that you&#39;ve seen yourself I like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.930" end="00:17:30.210" style="s2">question yeah appreciate that I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.110" end="00:17:31.890" style="s2">what do I want to say about that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.210" end="00:17:34.380" style="s2">interesting thing about circling is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.890" end="00:17:38.460" style="s2">no two circles are the same and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.380" end="00:17:40.020" style="s2">if we were say circling you and we did</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:41.190" style="s2">it today and let&#39;s say we did it with</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.020" end="00:17:44.370" style="s2">this group of people that are here</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.190" end="00:17:46.380" style="s2">listening and then say two hours from</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.370" end="00:17:48.570" style="s2">now or tomorrow I don&#39;t know we notice</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.380" end="00:17:50.130" style="s2">I&#39;m sent out again circle is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.570" end="00:17:51.330" style="s2">completely different what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.130" end="00:17:55.260" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be complete like they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.330" end="00:17:57.540" style="s2">snowflakes and some of the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.260" end="00:17:59.160" style="s2">that is well primarily is because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.540" end="00:18:00.900" style="s2">different in every moment there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.160" end="00:18:02.760" style="s2">something else that&#39;s sort of happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.900" end="00:18:04.170" style="s2">for us like when we do it again you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.760" end="00:18:05.640" style="s2">have the experience of the first one</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.170" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">carried over into this one and it will</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.640" end="00:18:11.040" style="s2">shift how you experience it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason why we try not</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.040" end="00:18:16.670" style="s2">to really assert too much about what</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">people are gonna get out of circling so</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.670" end="00:18:23.070" style="s2">for example you know encircling we will</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.730" end="00:18:25.950" style="s2">do often a short meditation to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.070" end="00:18:27.690" style="s2">connect to ourselves and the default of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.950" end="00:18:30.330" style="s2">that meditation is usually to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.690" end="00:18:31.650" style="s2">focus on you know on our breath and just</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.330" end="00:18:33.870" style="s2">sort of notice the breath moving through</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.650" end="00:18:36.660" style="s2">the body they&#39;re very basic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.870" end="00:18:38.700" style="s2">breath meditation but the thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.660" end="00:18:42.120" style="s2">that this meditation isn&#39;t comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.700" end="00:18:43.650" style="s2">for everybody and things can come up</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.120" end="00:18:46.410" style="s2">even just in the meditation we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.650" end="00:18:47.820" style="s2">even into the circling practice yet so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.410" end="00:18:48.690" style="s2">think there&#39;s something about circling</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.820" end="00:18:52.050" style="s2">the sort of review</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.690" end="00:18:56.070" style="s2">a uniqueness or things that make us</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.050" end="00:18:58.650" style="s2">unique and in that we can all have very</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.070" end="00:19:04.170" style="s2">very different experiences being circled</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.650" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">and some people who are maybe if we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.170" end="00:19:07.920" style="s2">to label them I like a bit more avoid</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:10.050" style="s2">and the process of circling can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.920" end="00:19:11.580" style="s2">really confronting even though we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.050" end="00:19:13.050" style="s2">agreements in the first agreement just</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.580" end="00:19:14.610" style="s2">honor yourself and you don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.050" end="00:19:18.900" style="s2">or say anything you don&#39;t want to and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.610" end="00:19:21.750" style="s2">yet we don&#39;t all fully possess or stand</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.900" end="00:19:24.030" style="s2">within that that power and autonomy so</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.750" end="00:19:27.030" style="s2">to varying degrees in a circle we might</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.030" end="00:19:28.770" style="s2">sort of give our power away to other</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.030" end="00:19:31.560" style="s2">people in the circle to the facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.770" end="00:19:33.270" style="s2">like we&#39;re just all so different and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.560" end="00:19:37.560" style="s2">outcome of circling can be also</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.270" end="00:19:39.390" style="s2">different so if I would say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.560" end="00:19:41.790" style="s2">anything that&#39;s like a consistent</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.390" end="00:19:43.920" style="s2">outcome that I would label or</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.790" end="00:19:47.130" style="s2">potentially label as negative is some</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.920" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">people realizing they&#39;re not ready like</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.130" end="00:19:53.430" style="s2">they&#39;re not ready to really look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:55.680" style="s2">what&#39;s already there</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.430" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">and I would say that&#39;s that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.680" end="00:20:01.050" style="s2">reasonably consistent in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:03.630" style="s2">people who don&#39;t don&#39;t come back and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.050" end="00:20:06.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not even so much that the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.630" end="00:20:09.690" style="s2">circle itself or the energies any way</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.270" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">hostile or anything like that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.690" end="00:20:15.900" style="s2">you know we&#39;re inviting people into</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:18.120" style="s2">vulnerability and some of us are more</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.900" end="00:20:19.920" style="s2">used to it than others and some of us</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.120" end="00:20:23.100" style="s2">are okay with a vulnerability hangover</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.920" end="00:20:24.330" style="s2">and some of us are like oh my god they</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.100" end="00:20:27.320" style="s2">almost think I&#39;m an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.330" end="00:20:29.910" style="s2">and they just don&#39;t come back anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.320" end="00:20:33.030" style="s2">but I would still say that&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.910" end="00:20:36.630" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fairly rare sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.030" end="00:20:38.220" style="s2">that happens and you know some circles</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.630" end="00:20:40.980" style="s2">are just boring I&#39;m like they can</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.220" end="00:20:45.140" style="s2">actually just be boring right why isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.980" end="00:20:46.820" style="s2">what&#39;s that what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.140" end="00:20:48.230" style="s2">sorry I haven&#39;t microphone troubles here</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.820" end="00:20:50.150" style="s2">no no I was just just agreeing with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.230" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">yeah but there&#39;s a wide range that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.150" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">go back and forth of me interaction</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:56.270" style="s2">right yeah yeah exactly so I mean some</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.260" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">of them can even be boring and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.270" end="00:21:02.090" style="s2">for for those who you know come in</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.090" end="00:21:06.260" style="s2">don&#39;t have that expectation that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.580" end="00:21:08.390" style="s2">know they might not come back I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.260" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty common for most practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.390" end="00:21:13.730" style="s2">like you know we get out of the practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:15.320" style="s2">will we put into it and if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.730" end="00:21:18.140" style="s2">really really ready for the practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.320" end="00:21:20.630" style="s2">then we&#39;re probably not gonna come back</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.140" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">to it period so I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.630" end="00:21:26.620" style="s2">circlings unique in any particular way</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:30.620" style="s2">other than you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.620" end="00:21:34.580" style="s2">socialized sort of way in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.620" end="00:21:36.230" style="s2">be where people are threatening people</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.580" end="00:21:39.830" style="s2">can be really exciting but they can also</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.230" end="00:21:43.550" style="s2">be really threatening and if we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.830" end="00:21:47.090" style="s2">some like a real fear of judgment and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.550" end="00:21:51.230" style="s2">maybe not a lot of resiliency in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.090" end="00:21:53.390" style="s2">area you know we might freeze up or or</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.230" end="00:21:56.600" style="s2">just realize like oh yeah no I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.390" end="00:21:58.280" style="s2">that was way too scary I mean well I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.600" end="00:21:59.810" style="s2">definitely a different person same</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.280" end="00:22:01.490" style="s2">content could be shared and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.810" end="00:22:04.160" style="s2">like oh yeah like why don&#39;t we start</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.490" end="00:22:07.430" style="s2">taking our clothes off you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.160" end="00:22:09.950" style="s2">a really wide spectrum of what people</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.430" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">are looking for in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.950" end="00:22:14.690" style="s2">people in the practice and the cool</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:17.690" style="s2">thing about it is the practice is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.690" end="00:22:19.220" style="s2">flexible and that&#39;s also in some ways a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.690" end="00:22:20.750" style="s2">detriment because I can&#39;t actually tell</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:23.270" style="s2">you what&#39;s going to happen in the circle</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.750" end="00:22:25.670" style="s2">you may not want to actually reveal much</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.270" end="00:22:28.910" style="s2">about yourself and we&#39;ll actually spend</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.670" end="00:22:31.460" style="s2">most of the time in the circle in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.910" end="00:22:33.650" style="s2">resistance of not wanting to share like</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.460" end="00:22:36.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing we&#39;ll be with so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.650" end="00:22:38.300" style="s2">actually necessarily learn not that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.740" end="00:22:40.580" style="s2">wherever there for content we know but</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.300" end="00:22:42.230" style="s2">we&#39;re not necessarily gonna like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.580" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">not going to be necessarily vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.230" end="00:22:47.030" style="s2">about the thing that you&#39;re resisting</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:48.500" style="s2">being vulnerable about but maybe if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.030" end="00:22:53.210" style="s2">can like more fully be with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.500" end="00:22:55.400" style="s2">resistance that can that can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.210" end="00:22:57.299" style="s2">interesting it can also be again this</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.400" end="00:22:59.399" style="s2">sometimes can be boring yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.299" end="00:23:01.379" style="s2">Tomica yeah and it really sounds like it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.399" end="00:23:05.059" style="s2">may depend on the skill of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.379" end="00:23:08.220" style="s2">facilitator or whoever is helping to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.059" end="00:23:09.779" style="s2">shape that process it it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.220" end="00:23:11.549" style="s2">there there is a great deal of variance</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.779" end="00:23:13.139" style="s2">there with regards to how people will</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.549" end="00:23:14.360" style="s2">respond to it as they come into it for</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.139" end="00:23:17.100" style="s2">the first time</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.360" end="00:23:18.179" style="s2">totally yeah totally I mean and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.100" end="00:23:22.139" style="s2">why we have a training course a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.179" end="00:23:24.840" style="s2">certification process you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.139" end="00:23:27.869" style="s2">number of groups out there that call</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.840" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing circling and I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.869" end="00:23:33.720" style="s2">necessarily call what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.220" end="00:23:38.580" style="s2">circling so you know that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.720" end="00:23:41.009" style="s2">a it&#39;s the word like a result of the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.580" end="00:23:44.639" style="s2">in which it was not her had not been</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.009" end="00:23:46.440" style="s2">regulated you know had been no attempt</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.639" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">to sort of regulate it and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.440" end="00:23:49.470" style="s2">was a very I know if you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:52.830" style="s2">with integral theory but it&#39;s you know a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.470" end="00:23:54.299" style="s2">very sort of green seeming process even</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.830" end="00:23:56.309" style="s2">though I think it&#39;s an integral practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.299" end="00:23:59.129" style="s2">it&#39;s a very green seeming process you</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.309" end="00:24:03.419" style="s2">know like I think it attracts people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.129" end="00:24:08.190" style="s2">were more in a green mindset and from</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.419" end="00:24:09.869" style="s2">that place it you know there starts to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.190" end="00:24:11.609" style="s2">be things but now you should be like</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.869" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">sort of free for everybody you know like</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.609" end="00:24:15.419" style="s2">let&#39;s you know let&#39;s not regulate it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">like we&#39;re sort of blind to the things</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.419" end="00:24:18.960" style="s2">that happen when somebody turns around</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:21.419" style="s2">and does bad therapy or something and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:23.999" style="s2">calls it circling like it it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.419" end="00:24:27.809" style="s2">potentially devalues the thing that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.999" end="00:24:29.730" style="s2">people who know what they&#39;re doing are</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.809" end="00:24:31.710" style="s2">doing or an offering so it&#39;s this sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.730" end="00:24:33.539" style="s2">of a tricky thing when you have like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.710" end="00:24:36.749" style="s2">generis Peschel II such a generic term</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.539" end="00:24:38.190" style="s2">like the word circling right right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.749" end="00:24:41.999" style="s2">that seemed destined like a serious</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.190" end="00:24:44.039" style="s2">branding issue and well how do you solve</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.999" end="00:24:47.460" style="s2">that that&#39;s that is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.039" end="00:24:49.769" style="s2">question because then the authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.460" end="00:24:52.440" style="s2">of it is in like the the procedure</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.769" end="00:24:57.210" style="s2">itself right like in the and the acting</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.440" end="00:24:58.980" style="s2">out of it yeah definitely definitely and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.210" end="00:25:01.460" style="s2">I think the way we&#39;ve tried to address</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.980" end="00:25:04.950" style="s2">is just to take more responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.460" end="00:25:09.749" style="s2">how circling showing up in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.950" end="00:25:10.440" style="s2">based on what we&#39;re bringing forward I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.749" end="00:25:11.669" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.440" end="00:25:15.659" style="s2">noticing all the beeps and I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.669" end="00:25:16.980" style="s2">wondering how I could stop those so</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.659" end="00:25:19.830" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the approach that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.980" end="00:25:22.110" style="s2">taken and sort of expanding our training</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.830" end="00:25:24.330" style="s2">deepening our training having different</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.110" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">prerequisites for people ready to ready</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.330" end="00:25:30.049" style="s2">to start to practice with the general</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.070" end="00:25:32.940" style="s2">public we have a certification process</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.049" end="00:25:36.210" style="s2">so that&#39;s sort of we feel like the best</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.940" end="00:25:38.460" style="s2">that we can do and as we continue to</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.210" end="00:25:40.350" style="s2">sort of grow as leaders and teachers you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.460" end="00:25:44.129" style="s2">know that the training gets better it</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.350" end="00:25:45.899" style="s2">gets sharper and yeah I mean that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.129" end="00:25:47.730" style="s2">feel like that&#39;s the best that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.899" end="00:25:53.629" style="s2">in terms of what circling is and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.730" end="00:25:56.909" style="s2">continue to to do what we&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.629" end="00:25:59.309" style="s2">trusting it like really trusting the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.909" end="00:26:02.190" style="s2">process you know sharing it with other</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.309" end="00:26:04.440" style="s2">people listening to feedback getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.190" end="00:26:07.110" style="s2">feedback listening to the feedback that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.440" end="00:26:09.629" style="s2">other circling leaders or communities</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.110" end="00:26:12.929" style="s2">are getting and I&#39;m just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.629" end="00:26:15.769" style="s2">navigating that way I like that strategy</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.929" end="00:26:19.049" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like being so bright that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.769" end="00:26:24.419" style="s2">any inauthentic competitor seems dull by</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.049" end="00:26:26.690" style="s2">comparison yeah and you know I feel a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.419" end="00:26:28.919" style="s2">little bit protective of anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.690" end="00:26:33.690" style="s2">you know whose hearts in the right place</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.919" end="00:26:35.759" style="s2">but maybe hasn&#39;t you know hasn&#39;t gotten</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.690" end="00:26:39.779" style="s2">a really good training or has</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.759" end="00:26:43.830" style="s2">prioritized a certain aspect of circling</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.779" end="00:26:45.720" style="s2">over something else like you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.830" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">the things about circling that&#39;s maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.720" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">little bit different than a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">modalities is the facilitator at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">in the style of circling we do the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:57.860" style="s2">facilitator is also a participant so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:27:01.320" style="s2">facilitators actually in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.860" end="00:27:03.000" style="s2">with the circle II so that means when</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.320" end="00:27:05.940" style="s2">I&#39;m facilitating like I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.000" end="00:27:09.240" style="s2">myself forward what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.940" end="00:27:11.669" style="s2">if I&#39;m haven&#39;t done my work you know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.240" end="00:27:13.409" style="s2">I if I have particular maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.669" end="00:27:15.179" style="s2">developmental trauma or something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.409" end="00:27:18.750" style="s2">happening in the circle that I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.179" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">subject to or reactive to I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.750" end="00:27:24.029" style="s2">bringing that into a relationship as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:25.739" style="s2">facilitator so</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.029" end="00:27:27.389" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing you know it&#39;s it&#39;s led</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.739" end="00:27:30.809" style="s2">to us creating ethics documents and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.389" end="00:27:32.700" style="s2">everything else so that we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.809" end="00:27:34.409" style="s2">doing this practice in a responsible way</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.700" end="00:27:36.269" style="s2">because we&#39;re inviting people into</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.409" end="00:27:39.269" style="s2">vulnerability we&#39;re inviting people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.269" end="00:27:42.389" style="s2">explore and ask themselves questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.269" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">that a lot of us don&#39;t tend to ask and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.389" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">they can be really revealing and it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:48.059" style="s2">be really confronting that can also be</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:50.639" style="s2">amazingly healing and therapeutic as</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.059" end="00:27:53.609" style="s2">well you know so that&#39;s a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.639" end="00:27:55.139" style="s2">reason why why we do the exploration but</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.609" end="00:27:56.909" style="s2">we also have to be conscious that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.139" end="00:27:58.139" style="s2">know not everybody is ready and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.909" end="00:28:00.779" style="s2">sometimes things are going to come up</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.139" end="00:28:02.549" style="s2">and you might have a facilitator it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.779" end="00:28:05.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have much experience in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.549" end="00:28:09.299" style="s2">practice isn&#39;t even aware of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.549" end="00:28:11.580" style="s2">sensitivity you know and you can have an</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.299" end="00:28:14.129" style="s2">interesting situation on your hands with</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.580" end="00:28:15.779" style="s2">less experienced people who maybe didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.129" end="00:28:17.669" style="s2">learn circling from the school maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.779" end="00:28:19.109" style="s2">just watched a few videos online and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.669" end="00:28:21.749" style="s2">thought like I hadn&#39;t got the gist of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.109" end="00:28:23.460" style="s2">this and you know that&#39;s fine you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.749" end="00:28:24.989" style="s2">if you&#39;re like hanging out with your</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.460" end="00:28:27.330" style="s2">friends or whatever but you know when</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.989" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">you&#39;re creating an event and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.330" end="00:28:30.599" style="s2">putting it under a name and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:34.889" style="s2">this structure trying to build a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.599" end="00:28:38.759" style="s2">community trying to to grow awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.889" end="00:28:40.499" style="s2">a practice yeah I want to be really</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.759" end="00:28:44.070" style="s2">careful like I just don&#39;t want anybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.499" end="00:28:45.749" style="s2">to be hurt and I don&#39;t want that in any</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.070" end="00:28:47.339" style="s2">practice but you know this is one that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.749" end="00:28:49.619" style="s2">I&#39;m actually teaching this is one that</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.339" end="00:28:51.629" style="s2">I&#39;m actually facilitating so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.619" end="00:28:54.749" style="s2">taking trying to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.629" end="00:29:01.259" style="s2">what it is that I&#39;m putting it there for</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.749" end="00:29:02.909" style="s2">such potent work yeah well you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.259" end="00:29:06.059" style="s2">maybe we could say more on that hurt</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.909" end="00:29:07.409" style="s2">part because like as you were rightly</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.059" end="00:29:09.299" style="s2">pointing out before there I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.409" end="00:29:11.969" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of discomfort there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.299" end="00:29:13.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of yeah and it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.969" end="00:29:16.289" style="s2">a lot of discomfort in the revealing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.559" end="00:29:19.619" style="s2">the unveiling of of these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.289" end="00:29:21.719" style="s2">try to run from so often so I think it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.619" end="00:29:24.450" style="s2">maybe is it&#39;s almost the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.719" end="00:29:27.330" style="s2">confrontation of these these dark parts</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.450" end="00:29:30.839" style="s2">of ourselves seem almost inevitable as</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.330" end="00:29:32.639" style="s2">an aspect of this deep authentic</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.839" end="00:29:36.059" style="s2">relation process for at least for most</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.639" end="00:29:37.980" style="s2">of us so I think yeah I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.059" end="00:29:40.740" style="s2">feel like the the presentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.980" end="00:29:43.140" style="s2">whole thing if it&#39;s conversant with with</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.740" end="00:29:45.240" style="s2">like the full experience it acknowledges</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.140" end="00:29:47.370" style="s2">that there is some aspect of this which</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.240" end="00:29:50.070" style="s2">which may prick a little or may may</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.370" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">bruise or at least begin massaging a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.070" end="00:29:57.090" style="s2">bruise that&#39;s long been hurting perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:59.370" style="s2">yeah yeah definitely yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.090" end="00:30:01.620" style="s2">sort of the nature of the exploring you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.370" end="00:30:05.250" style="s2">know like I think so many what is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.620" end="00:30:07.650" style="s2">Stan takun says 99 he&#39;s a relational</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.250" end="00:30:09.570" style="s2">psychotherapist there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.650" end="00:30:14.090" style="s2">relationship work I&#39;m he wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.570" end="00:30:17.070" style="s2">called he&#39;s written a few books actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.090" end="00:30:20.970" style="s2">around relationships in love and now he</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.070" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">says 99 or 98 percent of everything that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.970" end="00:30:27.540" style="s2">we do is automatic like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:32.730" style="s2">reactive beings there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.540" end="00:30:34.620" style="s2">conscious thought throughout our day so</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.730" end="00:30:37.230" style="s2">we&#39;re just reacting to things that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.620" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">integrated into our body system and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.230" end="00:30:44.910" style="s2">know as we grow up and develop certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:47.640" style="s2">we want to call them contractions you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.910" end="00:30:49.380" style="s2">know can get formed through the growing</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.640" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">up and through the developmental process</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.380" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">and these sort of become maybe to use a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:59.070" style="s2">nice term like a sticking point for us</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:01.799" style="s2">in relationship you know usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:04.440" style="s2">somewhere where as a child you were sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.799" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">of told your way of being is not okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.440" end="00:31:08.429" style="s2">you know your expression is not okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:10.049" style="s2">you&#39;re too much or you&#39;re not enough or</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.429" end="00:31:14.130" style="s2">whatever that is you know and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.049" end="00:31:16.890" style="s2">really integrated and and then as we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.130" end="00:31:19.020" style="s2">sort of grow up and move into you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.890" end="00:31:22.380" style="s2">adulthood and we move into that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.020" end="00:31:25.169" style="s2">real busyness that real 99% of our day</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.380" end="00:31:29.250" style="s2">being automatic and sort of engrained</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.169" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">and like a real habit and pattern it can</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.250" end="00:31:35.340" style="s2">be confronting just to sit in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.740" end="00:31:37.290" style="s2">in silence and slow down like just to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.340" end="00:31:39.780" style="s2">sort of like okay you don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.290" end="00:31:42.270" style="s2">anything right now we&#39;re just you just</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.780" end="00:31:45.299" style="s2">need to be in so much if you can allow</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.270" end="00:31:47.700" style="s2">yourself to be in this moment in just</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.299" end="00:31:50.630" style="s2">that by itself like just that slowing</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.700" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">down can bring up things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.630" end="00:31:55.460" style="s2">the awareness of a stress that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:57.770" style="s2">that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve pushed back or pushed</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.460" end="00:31:59.450" style="s2">aside because we had a job to do or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.770" end="00:32:01.610" style="s2">kids needed to get to school or I need</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.450" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">to make dinner or I&#39;ve got papers due or</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.610" end="00:32:06.100" style="s2">whatever that is you know whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:09.530" style="s2">business of our life distracts us from</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.100" end="00:32:12.470" style="s2">from what&#39;s already here so even just</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.530" end="00:32:13.940" style="s2">that you know opening part of a circle</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.470" end="00:32:16.220" style="s2">for sometimes I&#39;ve been in I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.940" end="00:32:18.710" style="s2">some circles but we sit down we come out</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.220" end="00:32:21.410" style="s2">of the meditation and immediately the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.710" end="00:32:23.000" style="s2">circle he&#39;s crying and like that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.410" end="00:32:24.860" style="s2">know they they weren&#39;t doing that five</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.000" end="00:32:27.350" style="s2">minutes ago so something in the slowing</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.860" end="00:32:30.850" style="s2">down something in the witnessing or</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.350" end="00:32:33.260" style="s2">being witnessed um in that place just</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.850" end="00:32:37.100" style="s2">that name itself can open things up for</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.260" end="00:32:41.480" style="s2">people and that opening can be a real</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.100" end="00:32:45.830" style="s2">release can be a real amazing experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.480" end="00:32:48.650" style="s2">to sort of just feel like you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.830" end="00:32:51.140" style="s2">accepted as you are in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.650" end="00:32:53.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to do anything in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.140" end="00:32:56.210" style="s2">and itself can be such a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.240" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">for some people and for others it can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.210" end="00:33:01.640" style="s2">super confronting because you know their</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:04.280" style="s2">third day today is managing and trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.640" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">to keep it together and you know when</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.280" end="00:33:08.420" style="s2">you&#39;re in the circle and you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:12.140" style="s2">to do anything you don&#39;t have to really</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.420" end="00:33:13.940" style="s2">care take anybody you don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.140" end="00:33:16.610" style="s2">really have a destination other than to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.940" end="00:33:20.290" style="s2">be more fully here with each other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.610" end="00:33:23.420" style="s2">those things open up yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.290" end="00:33:27.140" style="s2">amazing and cool and it&#39;s just not a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.420" end="00:33:30.170" style="s2">that a lot of us are it&#39;s not a place</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.140" end="00:33:32.180" style="s2">that we visit frequently if at all so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.170" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">once we do once we start to do that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.180" end="00:33:40.940" style="s2">it can be confronting for sure yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:45.110" style="s2">said thank you thank for that I&#39;ll step</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.350" end="00:34:15.210" style="s2">mentioned that you have run groups that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.540" end="00:34:19.409" style="s2">have been like a consistent week to week</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.210" end="00:34:21.330" style="s2">same set of people as opposed to groups</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.409" end="00:34:24.750" style="s2">where you know it&#39;s just kind of random</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.330" end="00:34:26.550" style="s2">each each time what what have you</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.750" end="00:34:30.929" style="s2">noticed in those groups where there has</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.550" end="00:34:34.890" style="s2">been that consistency yeah yeah no for</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.929" end="00:34:38.640" style="s2">sure yeah so what we&#39;ve noticed is and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.890" end="00:34:40.409" style="s2">what consistently happens is the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.640" end="00:34:45.060" style="s2">that I would phrase it is we start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.409" end="00:34:47.550" style="s2">get I start to feel a little more safer</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.060" end="00:34:49.080" style="s2">and I sort of you can&#39;t see me because</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.550" end="00:34:54.929" style="s2">this is in that video but I put quotes</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.080" end="00:34:56.640" style="s2">around the word safer because number one</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.929" end="00:34:57.990" style="s2">when we&#39;re in the group or no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.640" end="00:35:01.770" style="s2">gonna see the other people in the group</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.990" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">next week so when it comes to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:05.310" style="s2">revealing something or like sharing</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">something that might be really edgy like</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.310" end="00:35:09.380" style="s2">to turn around and tell somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:11.490" style="s2">I&#39;m really annoyed that you said that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.380" end="00:35:14.570" style="s2">like that can be really hard for</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.490" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">somebody to say especially if they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.570" end="00:35:20.850" style="s2">conflict avoidant um however you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.710" style="s2">based on the agreements that we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.850" end="00:35:24.600" style="s2">hold in the space and the knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.710" end="00:35:30.450" style="s2">that person is committed to being there</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.600" end="00:35:33.110" style="s2">again I&#39;ve seen it allow more</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.450" end="00:35:36.750" style="s2">possibility and what people will share</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.110" end="00:35:38.940" style="s2">because of this safety and this trust</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.750" end="00:35:41.700" style="s2">either trust based on how the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.940" end="00:35:44.850" style="s2">people in being in the group have been</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.700" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">responding to them or interfacing with</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.850" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">them or trust in that like I know at</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:50.700" style="s2">least I&#39;m going to see you next week and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:54.300" style="s2">even though there&#39;s only five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.700" end="00:35:57.360" style="s2">left in our call like we can clean this</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.300" end="00:36:01.350" style="s2">up next week so those sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.360" end="00:36:04.590" style="s2">really seem to free us up to to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.350" end="00:36:05.400" style="s2">start to have these maybe riskier</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.590" end="00:36:08.940" style="s2">expression</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.400" end="00:36:13.559" style="s2">and from that place we are more able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.940" end="00:36:17.069" style="s2">go deeper into sort of our experiences</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.559" end="00:36:19.979" style="s2">or our truth in the in the group in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.069" end="00:36:23.249" style="s2">relationship so that&#39;s a very consistent</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.979" end="00:36:26.039" style="s2">thing that we see in that group which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.249" end="00:36:28.529" style="s2">why we you know run the group a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.039" end="00:36:30.420" style="s2">bit smaller too so it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.529" end="00:36:33.660" style="s2">more intimate when we run the circles in</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.420" end="00:36:36.180" style="s2">those groups whereas you know if we do a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.660" end="00:36:38.519" style="s2">drop-in event we might have you know ten</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.180" end="00:36:43.769" style="s2">people in a circle or as when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.519" end="00:36:45.180" style="s2">doing the core practice group we you</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.769" end="00:36:48.119" style="s2">know we only have about five or six</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:50.339" style="s2">people in each circle and the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.119" end="00:36:53.099" style="s2">piece too is like you can you can carry</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.339" end="00:36:57.450" style="s2">on a thread or you can start to notice</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.099" end="00:37:00.119" style="s2">patterns and sort of like oh what is it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.450" end="00:37:02.819" style="s2">about this guy I&#39;m always like getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.119" end="00:37:06.410" style="s2">butt up with with you know with Tom over</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.819" end="00:37:08.759" style="s2">here we always seem to be sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.410" end="00:37:11.969" style="s2">avoiding each other you know like it</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.759" end="00:37:14.789" style="s2">takes repeated sort of time in these</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.969" end="00:37:16.920" style="s2">relationships to start to notice these</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.789" end="00:37:18.690" style="s2">things unless you&#39;re like have a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.920" end="00:37:23.009" style="s2">good and high capacity of self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.690" end="00:37:25.259" style="s2">and perception so so yeah it&#39;s just more</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.009" end="00:37:26.700" style="s2">like more is available in the committed</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.259" end="00:37:29.339" style="s2">groups beyond the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.700" end="00:37:32.460" style="s2">actually doing you know over a quarter</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.339" end="00:37:34.200" style="s2">you know 40 hours or so circling over</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.460" end="00:37:35.999" style="s2">that span of time compared to a drop-in</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.200" end="00:37:39.719" style="s2">event where we might do just under two</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.999" end="00:37:42.569" style="s2">hours of it there&#39;s that more obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.719" end="00:37:44.969" style="s2">some more practice but we can just sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.569" end="00:37:47.369" style="s2">of deep and what&#39;s already there because</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.969" end="00:37:50.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve had all these past experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.369" end="00:37:53.460" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing a similar thing also happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.660" end="00:37:56.329" style="s2">in the experiment that I&#39;m running to -</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.460" end="00:38:00.569" style="s2">John and I were talking about the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.329" end="00:38:05.009" style="s2">recent branch of it that I I started</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.569" end="00:38:08.700" style="s2">with with Josh Stein we&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.009" end="00:38:10.650" style="s2">series of three sessions about two and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.700" end="00:38:13.859" style="s2">half hours of peace and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.650" end="00:38:15.809" style="s2">noticing is in these you know collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.859" end="00:38:18.920" style="s2">intelligence campfires that were calling</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.809" end="00:38:18.920" style="s2">them in these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.980" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">more is available there&#39;s less filtering</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.110" end="00:38:28.050" style="s2">as we go into the subsequent sessions so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:29.910" style="s2">more seems to be available in the space</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.050" end="00:38:33.240" style="s2">there&#39;s more energy there&#39;s more what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.910" end="00:38:35.070" style="s2">would call lifeforce and that&#39;s I just</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.240" end="00:38:36.390" style="s2">think that&#39;s you know that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.070" end="00:38:39.480" style="s2">ingredient that we&#39;re really looking for</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.390" end="00:38:51.270" style="s2">that that makes these practices so</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.480" end="00:38:54.540" style="s2">exciting things that people have</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.270" end="00:38:56.490" style="s2">reported that have helped them you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.540" end="00:39:01.190" style="s2">that after circling like what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.490" end="00:39:04.050" style="s2">improvements they see yeah well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.190" end="00:39:07.890" style="s2">yeah I would say they they run the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.050" end="00:39:09.690" style="s2">gamut but I know one thing that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.890" end="00:39:11.160" style="s2">noticed is you know there&#39;s some people</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.690" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">that sort of have a bit more of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.160" end="00:39:19.380" style="s2">punitive part of themselves and people</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:21.810" style="s2">being able to sort of manage or be more</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.380" end="00:39:23.670" style="s2">a choice about that or to feel an easing</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.810" end="00:39:27.330" style="s2">of that voice about critical voice in</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.670" end="00:39:29.640" style="s2">themselves I&#39;ve definitely heard a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.330" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">of reflections of that improving for</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.640" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">them like it being lasts or being more</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:37.770" style="s2">manageable so that&#39;s certainly one one</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:43.530" style="s2">example that I can think of certainly</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.770" end="00:39:46.200" style="s2">with the experience of feeling accepted</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.530" end="00:39:48.450" style="s2">as you are you know what we say when we</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.200" end="00:39:50.490" style="s2">do circling as we say circling is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.450" end="00:39:52.740" style="s2">therapy like we&#39;re not here to change</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.490" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">you we&#39;re not actually here to like heal</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.740" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">you like if you have a pro league it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:40:01.050" style="s2">not a support group and you know an</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:04.230" style="s2">underlying theory on I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.050" end="00:40:08.910" style="s2">accepting somebody as they are can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.230" end="00:40:10.970" style="s2">seen in Gestalt therapies the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.910" end="00:40:13.710" style="s2">paradoxical theory of change and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.970" end="00:40:15.660" style="s2">one sort of suggests that the more in</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.710" end="00:40:17.580" style="s2">which we try to get somebody to change</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.660" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">the more they dig their heels in and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.580" end="00:40:22.890" style="s2">it&#39;s only when we can come to acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:24.660" style="s2">of them that they can start to accept</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.890" end="00:40:29.070" style="s2">themselves and the real transformations</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.660" end="00:40:30.350" style="s2">possible and we&#39;ve seen that we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.070" end="00:40:32.900" style="s2">that a lot I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.350" end="00:40:35.000" style="s2">just for me has been massive and my own</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.900" end="00:40:37.820" style="s2">development the anecdote that I usually</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.000" end="00:40:40.520" style="s2">share about circling is before I came</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.820" end="00:40:42.470" style="s2">into it I felt very misanthropic like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.520" end="00:40:44.180" style="s2">really didn&#39;t like people and I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.470" end="00:40:46.660" style="s2">blamed everybody out there for</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.180" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">everything that was wrong in my life</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.660" end="00:40:51.980" style="s2">something that I inherited I lovingly</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:54.830" style="s2">from my father but nonetheless embodied</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.980" end="00:40:56.750" style="s2">quite wholeheartedly and sort of through</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.830" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">the practice of circling and being with</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.750" end="00:41:04.850" style="s2">other people and you know we see how how</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:07.940" style="s2">alike and also how different we are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.850" end="00:41:09.950" style="s2">a beautiful way of getting a different</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.940" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.950" end="00:41:16.250" style="s2">I remember having some experiences with</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:18.350" style="s2">people of different races and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.250" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">hearing that firsthand accounted being</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.350" end="00:41:23.450" style="s2">with them I get the way in which were</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:25.640" style="s2">with somebody encircling about an</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.450" end="00:41:29.120" style="s2">experience that I I can&#39;t have as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.640" end="00:41:32.950" style="s2">middle-aged white guy but I can really</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.120" end="00:41:35.810" style="s2">feel and be with and get a real taste</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.950" end="00:41:38.060" style="s2">through through the practice of what it</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.810" end="00:41:39.650" style="s2">was like for those people to go through</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.060" end="00:41:42.890" style="s2">some of the experiences that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.650" end="00:41:46.010" style="s2">shared encircling and I can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.890" end="00:41:48.920" style="s2">although I can&#39;t confirm but I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.010" end="00:41:51.290" style="s2">imagine feeling heard and seen in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.920" end="00:41:55.820" style="s2">place by somebody who normally can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.290" end="00:41:57.490" style="s2">relate to that is it&#39;s got to be well</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.820" end="00:42:01.610" style="s2">calling it special is probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.490" end="00:42:04.190" style="s2">undercutting it a fair bit so so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.610" end="00:42:06.650" style="s2">mean even even just some people starting</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.190" end="00:42:08.390" style="s2">to bring more self awareness in being</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.650" end="00:42:10.520" style="s2">able to notice distinctions and their</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.390" end="00:42:12.410" style="s2">emotions you know like rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.520" end="00:42:14.660" style="s2">being mad it&#39;s like I know it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.410" end="00:42:17.750" style="s2">frustrated actually no no it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.660" end="00:42:20.930" style="s2">quality of an annoyance um actually no</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.750" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s more like I&#39;m flustered like even</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.930" end="00:42:25.580" style="s2">just adding on to an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:28.340" style="s2">vocabulary and sort of self awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.580" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">what somebody&#39;s feeling and being able</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.340" end="00:42:32.900" style="s2">to notice that in the moment and then do</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:38.990" style="s2">that translation into articulating it in</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.900" end="00:42:42.130" style="s2">real-time is huge for having deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.990" end="00:42:44.920" style="s2">grounded immediate conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.130" end="00:42:48.099" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s a handful of things but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.920" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">mean people are transformation like</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.099" end="00:42:56.200" style="s2">actual transformation is possible with</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:58.750" style="s2">encircling I&#39;ve seen it all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.200" end="00:43:01.480" style="s2">it&#39;s happened to me as well so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.750" end="00:43:02.920" style="s2">mean we could we could laundry list all</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.480" end="00:43:13.940" style="s2">the things that are possible but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.920" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a handful anyways anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.940" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">have a question they want to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.790" end="00:43:28.670" style="s2">okay are there any online resources for</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.840" end="00:43:32.120" style="s2">circling and you&#39;ve seen I knew you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.670" end="00:43:34.010" style="s2">would recommend I suppose it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.120" end="00:43:36.290" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.010" end="00:43:44.140" style="s2">say resources if it&#39;s like things to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.290" end="00:43:47.510" style="s2">read about the practice I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.140" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">don&#39;t nothing I can&#39;t think of anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.510" end="00:43:50.410" style="s2">that&#39;s necessarily wrong with what&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:53.120" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.410" end="00:43:56.920" style="s2">however given it&#39;s such a highly</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.120" end="00:44:01.430" style="s2">experimental or experiential practice I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.920" end="00:44:03.650" style="s2">think just reading one you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.430" end="00:44:06.650" style="s2">authentic relating organizations</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.650" end="00:44:08.750" style="s2">perspective on circling is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.650" end="00:44:10.310" style="s2">limiting so I aim that I actually sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.750" end="00:44:12.850" style="s2">of encourage you like you can check out</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.310" end="00:44:15.290" style="s2">guys hang stocks circling Institute</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.850" end="00:44:19.340" style="s2">there&#39;s some online platforms that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.290" end="00:44:22.700" style="s2">doing circling although I I struggle to</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.340" end="00:44:25.370" style="s2">to recommend some of them based on some</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.700" end="00:44:28.310" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve heard there is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.370" end="00:44:31.100" style="s2">platform that&#39;s circling Europe runs</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.310" end="00:44:35.780" style="s2">called circle anywhere and where they</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.100" end="00:44:39.320" style="s2">run daily circles I they do a different</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.780" end="00:44:41.090" style="s2">flavors circling called</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.320" end="00:44:42.950" style="s2">well they do birthday circling as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.090" end="00:44:44.840" style="s2">but they also have another version sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.950" end="00:44:47.210" style="s2">of called surrendered leadership that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.840" end="00:44:51.080" style="s2">would say is an amazingly potent</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.210" end="00:44:54.650" style="s2">practice but it&#39;s not not accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.080" end="00:44:57.020" style="s2">everybody it&#39;s sort of my judgment about</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.650" end="00:45:01.370" style="s2">it I&#39;ve defended the practice a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.020" end="00:45:03.770" style="s2">love those guys the three guys that lead</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.370" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">that that group in that practice I</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.770" end="00:45:08.570" style="s2">recently spent a week with them back in</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:10.700" style="s2">January doing one of their advanced</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.570" end="00:45:12.710" style="s2">trainings just to sort of see like</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.700" end="00:45:15.830" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with them I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.710" end="00:45:19.450" style="s2">nothing but the the highest respect for</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.830" end="00:45:23.060" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing and I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.450" end="00:45:24.410" style="s2">attended one of our circling events and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.060" end="00:45:26.060" style="s2">then attended one of their circling</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.410" end="00:45:26.900" style="s2">events you would see like a huge</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.060" end="00:45:28.849" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.900" end="00:45:31.910" style="s2">and sort of the way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.849" end="00:45:33.559" style="s2">practice is held and I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.910" end="00:45:37.069" style="s2">one&#39;s better or worse I would just say</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.559" end="00:45:39.619" style="s2">that I think ours is a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.069" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">sustainable it&#39;s a little more sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.619" end="00:45:45.740" style="s2">not sustainable accessible ours a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.420" end="00:45:51.289" style="s2">more accessible and there&#39;s mm-hmm is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.740" end="00:45:53.480" style="s2">little I&#39;ll say edgier I&#39;m for lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.289" end="00:45:56.690" style="s2">better term much more confronting I</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.480" end="00:46:00.829" style="s2">would say and that&#39;s that really lends</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.690" end="00:46:03.559" style="s2">to the potency of that practice - so who</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.829" end="00:46:05.779" style="s2">was the more confronting group I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.559" end="00:46:07.779" style="s2">say I would say Circle in Europe I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.779" end="00:46:13.029" style="s2">say surrendered leadership practice is</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.779" end="00:46:16.549" style="s2">is substantially more confronting and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.029" end="00:46:19.010" style="s2">you know my hesitation to like</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.549" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">wholeheartedly recommended is you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.010" end="00:46:23.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s like so many</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:26.230" style="s2">conditions I think it could be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.150" end="00:46:28.940" style="s2">I love the practice personally myself</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.230" end="00:46:32.180" style="s2">however there are some people that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.940" end="00:46:34.130" style="s2">had in you know circles at art that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.180" end="00:46:37.210" style="s2">would I would never recommend that they</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.130" end="00:46:40.730" style="s2">go into a surround with leadership space</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.210" end="00:46:42.589" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of like a next we</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.730" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">can call it a next-level practice and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.589" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">some people sort of argued like should</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.720" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">we really call this circling and to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.380" style="s2">degree they&#39;ve sort of kind of pulled</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:52.700" style="s2">back from calling the surrendered</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.380" end="00:46:54.950" style="s2">leadership side of what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.700" end="00:46:56.660" style="s2">circling and then they added birthday</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.950" end="00:46:58.549" style="s2">circling sort of a style of circling</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.660" end="00:47:00.619" style="s2">that we do it or drop in events and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.549" end="00:47:02.660" style="s2">they&#39;ve added those and I imagine those</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.619" end="00:47:06.470" style="s2">are much more accessible I imagine they</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.660" end="00:47:09.079" style="s2">hold them a little bit differently for</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.470" end="00:47:11.569" style="s2">us at art we for drop-in events we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.079" end="00:47:13.220" style="s2">a Yein first approach and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.569" end="00:47:15.079" style="s2">familiar with the young longing sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.220" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">like more of a feminine compassion</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.079" end="00:47:20.569" style="s2">versus a masculine compassion default</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:23.480" style="s2">and we sort of go go more to to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.569" end="00:47:27.079" style="s2">inside for our drop-in events with</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.480" end="00:47:28.789" style="s2">surrender leadership well I mean it just</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.079" end="00:47:32.539" style="s2">sort of depends on who&#39;s the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.789" end="00:47:34.220" style="s2">leading but I don&#39;t think they they</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.539" end="00:47:37.970" style="s2">don&#39;t really have a policy it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.220" end="00:47:39.619" style="s2">more like what the facilitation or the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.970" end="00:47:40.730" style="s2">group is sensing in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.619" end="00:47:43.610" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of what they go</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.730" end="00:47:47.690" style="s2">and I&#39;ve had moments where I&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.610" end="00:47:49.700" style="s2">taken on a like dropping the frame that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.690" end="00:47:55.010" style="s2">I hold for birthday circling in our</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.700" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">circles and I&#39;ve had some people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.010" end="00:47:58.340" style="s2">in you know on the outside sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:01.430" style="s2">whoa what was that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.340" end="00:48:04.550" style="s2">you know like they just sort of like not</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.430" end="00:48:06.200" style="s2">what they were expecting and it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.550" end="00:48:08.570" style="s2">great and like it&#39;s just you know great</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.200" end="00:48:10.220" style="s2">experience in the circle but we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.570" end="00:48:15.080" style="s2">tried to create something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.220" end="00:48:17.240" style="s2">little bit more consistent that I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.080" end="00:48:19.880" style="s2">fits better for a public open to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.240" end="00:48:24.290" style="s2">newcomers sort of situation and we tend</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.880" end="00:48:25.850" style="s2">to only go into the more edgy side of</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.290" end="00:48:34.100" style="s2">circling and truth-telling</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.850" end="00:48:35.930" style="s2">in our advanced training courses one</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.100" end="00:48:38.330" style="s2">question I&#39;d like to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.930" end="00:48:40.220" style="s2">so John talks a lot about the religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.330" end="00:48:45.770" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion are you familiar</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.220" end="00:48:46.850" style="s2">with that yes so I tell me if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.770" end="00:48:50.450" style="s2">haven&#39;t given this a lot of thought but</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.850" end="00:48:53.990" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you have I I think John sees</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.450" end="00:48:55.940" style="s2">circling as part of that how you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.990" end="00:48:58.310" style="s2">we&#39;re just at the beginning stages of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.940" end="00:48:59.570" style="s2">just conceiving what this religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.310" end="00:49:02.450" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion can even look like</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.570" end="00:49:04.550" style="s2">but have you thought about how circling</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.450" end="00:49:09.320" style="s2">could be a part of that and what it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.550" end="00:49:12.530" style="s2">might look like yeah I mean the best way</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.320" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">I know how to sort of explain it or why</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.530" end="00:49:16.010" style="s2">or to sort of justify why I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:18.340" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.010" end="00:49:24.830" style="s2">is I would go to developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.340" end="00:49:29.330" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m I know a decent amount</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.830" end="00:49:31.250" style="s2">of about integral theory and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.330" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">Ken Wilber his most recent book was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.250" end="00:49:38.270" style="s2">religion of tomorrow where he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:41.450" style="s2">posits what you know what the next sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.270" end="00:49:43.190" style="s2">of thing that would emerge that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.450" end="00:49:45.800" style="s2">religion and everything that I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.190" end="00:49:48.320" style="s2">John say and and Jordan Hall around this</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.800" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">really largely he sort of maps on to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.320" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">lot of what Ken Wilber was saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:54.170" style="s2">sure there&#39;s some important distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:55.940" style="s2">but like as a general frame</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.170" end="00:49:57.260" style="s2">work they&#39;re sort of talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.940" end="00:50:00.680" style="s2">same thing they&#39;re just using a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.260" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">different like orientation or a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.680" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">different basis you know John coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">more from cognitive science and and can</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:10.670" style="s2">be coming more from you know just his</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:15.500" style="s2">experience of the world sort of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.670" end="00:50:18.260" style="s2">and the great religions so why not when</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.500" end="00:50:20.210" style="s2">I think of circling I a sort of a claim</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.260" end="00:50:22.550" style="s2">that circling is an integral practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.210" end="00:50:25.370" style="s2">and what I mean by that is I think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.550" end="00:50:28.760" style="s2">circling can meet people at whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.370" end="00:50:32.300" style="s2">developmental level that they&#39;re at as</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.760" end="00:50:34.340" style="s2">like a participant meaning it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.300" end="00:50:37.540" style="s2">dynamic practice meaning that if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.340" end="00:50:41.960" style="s2">have a really good sort of awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.540" end="00:50:46.250" style="s2">human development that you can really</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.960" end="00:50:48.680" style="s2">talk to people using this modality using</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.250" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">this sort of way of engaging way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.680" end="00:50:56.210" style="s2">being with people in a way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">can feel I&#39;ve seen accepted heard learn</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.210" end="00:51:02.330" style="s2">things about themselves you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:05.390" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to be quite so developed</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.330" end="00:51:08.030" style="s2">so for me I see like circling in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.390" end="00:51:09.260" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t even say a stripped down at</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.030" end="00:51:11.900" style="s2">all I would just say I could see</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.260" end="00:51:15.700" style="s2">circling you know be brought into</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.900" end="00:51:17.930" style="s2">schools and to change the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.700" end="00:51:21.130" style="s2">children at a very fundamental level</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.930" end="00:51:23.150" style="s2">start to communicate with one another</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.130" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">you know there would be certain things</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.150" end="00:51:27.110" style="s2">that I probably wouldn&#39;t necessarily do</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:29.120" style="s2">if I was facilitating a circle of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.110" end="00:51:31.070" style="s2">children because you know I&#39;d be trying</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.120" end="00:51:33.560" style="s2">to use the practice to meet them at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.070" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">developmental level you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.560" end="00:51:41.050" style="s2">going to go into you know I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:41.050" style="s2">spiritual practice or like the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:45.050" style="s2">sensitivity that I can have in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.430" end="00:51:47.810" style="s2">moment you know that feels like I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.050" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">psychedelics because I&#39;m so in the here</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.810" end="00:51:51.170" style="s2">and now I think I&#39;m not gonna go into</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:53.390" style="s2">that with you know with a kid but for</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.170" end="00:51:55.220" style="s2">them to like really start sharing like</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.390" end="00:51:57.530" style="s2">really transparently really</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.220" end="00:51:59.990" style="s2">authentically like hey how did how did</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.530" end="00:52:01.880" style="s2">that make you feel you know when when</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.990" end="00:52:06.260" style="s2">Chris turned away like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.880" end="00:52:07.670" style="s2">like to really just call forward you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.260" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">know that truth and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.670" end="00:52:12.890" style="s2">and to accept you know everybody whether</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:17.000" style="s2">they&#39;re children or not you know where</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.890" end="00:52:21.470" style="s2">they&#39;re at like I just like I think so</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.000" end="00:52:24.290" style="s2">many of the problems or the difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.470" end="00:52:27.650" style="s2">that we see in in our world in society</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.290" end="00:52:30.260" style="s2">really stem from developmental trauma in</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.650" end="00:52:33.500" style="s2">mom way or another and I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.260" end="00:52:37.790" style="s2">authentic relieving practice which</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.500" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">includes circling brought into to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.790" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">schools like at the earliest stages</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:45.980" style="s2">you know like with that consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:48.440" style="s2">sort of not trying to change somebody</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.980" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">but to really appreciate them as they</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.440" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">are in this moment is so immensely</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:53:01.670" style="s2">powerful that you know I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:03.650" style="s2">whole world would transform and there</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.670" end="00:53:06.190" style="s2">are some people trying to do that trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.650" end="00:53:08.960" style="s2">to bring authentic relating into schools</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.190" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">there is a group that&#39;s been bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.960" end="00:53:15.470" style="s2">into prisons and has had some fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:18.470" style="s2">success there see I just you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.470" end="00:53:21.380" style="s2">because of the level that I see this</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.470" end="00:53:24.740" style="s2">practice working at being higher than</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.380" end="00:53:26.690" style="s2">where we are socially like as like as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.740" end="00:53:29.900" style="s2">civilization it&#39;s like a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.690" end="00:53:32.089" style="s2">than where we are as a whole it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.900" end="00:53:34.430" style="s2">practice that can help pull us through</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.089" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">to the next sort of stage of development</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.430" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">as a society and you know I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:43.640" style="s2">in many ways a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:46.700" style="s2">that Jordan and and John are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.640" end="00:53:49.069" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s it&#39;s a you know this</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.700" end="00:53:51.799" style="s2">finding of a new meaning like looking</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.069" end="00:53:52.819" style="s2">for meaning within but acting in service</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.799" end="00:53:55.010" style="s2">is something that&#39;s greater than</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.819" end="00:53:57.890" style="s2">yourself I mean in many ways that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.010" end="00:54:00.710" style="s2">basis of so many religions no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.890" end="00:54:02.390" style="s2">they sort of twist and twist the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.710" end="00:54:05.030" style="s2">messaging you know that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.390" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">individual felt sense which John</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.030" end="00:54:09.970" style="s2">obviously goes into the specifics of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:13.460" style="s2">lot of the great religions in his series</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.970" end="00:54:15.859" style="s2">but yeah I just I just see I just see</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.460" end="00:54:21.300" style="s2">this type of practice this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.859" end="00:54:25.320" style="s2">present moment focused truth-telling</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.300" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">you know a lot of yen a lot of holding</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.320" end="00:54:33.960" style="s2">with a little bit of challenge is exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:36.450" style="s2">exactly what all of us need and needed</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.960" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">you know when we were growing up and for</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.450" end="00:54:43.020" style="s2">various reasons you know our her parents</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:44.790" style="s2">and our society you know had its own</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.020" end="00:54:46.680" style="s2">challenges that it was dealing with and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.790" end="00:54:51.660" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t really able to do the best job</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.680" end="00:54:54.620" style="s2">so I think this practice and practices</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.660" end="00:54:59.910" style="s2">like this are are just critical for</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.620" end="00:55:01.950" style="s2">Humanity&#39;s sustainability oh what a</p>
