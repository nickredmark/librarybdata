<p begin="00:00:09.290" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">I&#39;m very excited about this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">I have butterflies before each each time</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">we we speak who anticipating</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:23.490" style="s2">anticipating it was was very it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">germinating for me it when I was walking</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.490" end="00:00:27.960" style="s2">this morning I and I had been a trouble</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">wisdom yesterday doing all this work I</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.960" end="00:00:32.520" style="s2">actually ran the deal logos workshop and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">you know talking with Jordan hall and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.520" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">with Nora Bateson and so and then all</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">that was in my mind and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">work that Chris and I have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:43.649" style="s2">and then our previous dialogue about</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.100" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">soul all of that just sort of came</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.649" end="00:00:47.430" style="s2">together for me and so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">propose something to you I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.430" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">you got a chance to read that email I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">said yes and III love the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">might have a theory about Hans Hans or</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">something to do with beauty right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:02.219" style="s2">well no I what I want to do is so I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2">two I have two motives for this Mayo two</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.219" end="00:01:04.830" style="s2">reasons I think they&#39;re more than just</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">motives I think they&#39;re going to justify</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:10.409" style="s2">them I think they&#39;re reasons so what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an argument that&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">to try and not completely answer your</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">questions but leave at least give an</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">integrated way of it answering the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">questions that you posed so I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:22.140" style="s2">would act as an excellent platform for</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">the discussion because it&#39;s gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.140" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">about beauty and soul and do logos all</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">of that great um and and then what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">also wanted to do was I wanted to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:35.100" style="s2">playing and I mean in serious playing</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">with you know what does argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.100" end="00:01:39.750" style="s2">look like now within dialectic right</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">what does that look like because right</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.750" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">now we&#39;re doing a lot of this other</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">stuff and like we can talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">later about you know what we would I did</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">in the workshop if you want and at all</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s all great you know you do this</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">amplification and you&#39;re doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">work and I was already getting people to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">start moving off of propositions into I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">proposed that and you know and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">of move but I also want to try and start</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">playing with okay but what did like what</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:10.379" style="s2">cuz argue argumentation like deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">dialectic is not for closure right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.379" end="00:02:13.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not about coming to a conclusion so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:16.250" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.100" end="00:02:18.050" style="s2">argument Asian have so what the thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.250" end="00:02:21.290" style="s2">that came to mind is exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.050" end="00:02:23.300" style="s2">proposing here that the an argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.290" end="00:02:26.450" style="s2">is kind of like a setting forth of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.300" end="00:02:28.010" style="s2">platform that is supposed to you know is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.450" end="00:02:30.860" style="s2">supposed to lead to something beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.010" end="00:02:33.380" style="s2">argumentation as the dialectic unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.860" end="00:02:36.200" style="s2">well it is I wanna maybe I can just step</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.380" end="00:02:38.210" style="s2">back just a little bit haha and say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.200" end="00:02:41.600" style="s2">our last conversation was about I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.210" end="00:02:44.300" style="s2">proposed this notion of soul yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.600" end="00:02:46.310" style="s2">asked you to speak about that and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.300" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">John came up with the idea of reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.310" end="00:02:51.530" style="s2">EO but you have the Latin word for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:54.260" style="s2">reinventing and and reinventing which</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.530" end="00:02:56.110" style="s2">also means discovering right yes have I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.260" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">got that right and I also wholly</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.110" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">rediscovering because these notions are</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:01.400" style="s2">very old</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:05.210" style="s2">so what we&#39;re inventing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.400" end="00:03:07.640" style="s2">discovering at the same time and I then</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.210" end="00:03:09.940" style="s2">after our conversation I thought geez we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.640" end="00:03:13.310" style="s2">could reinvent everything you know a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.940" end="00:03:16.220" style="s2">soul we can reinvent beauty we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.310" end="00:03:17.960" style="s2">reinvent the world you know I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.220" end="00:03:20.150" style="s2">to be inflationary but it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.960" end="00:03:22.310" style="s2">we&#39;re moving into a new paradigm we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.150" end="00:03:23.900" style="s2">to reinvent how we see practically</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.310" end="00:03:26.540" style="s2">everything right that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.900" end="00:03:30.320" style="s2">and you I think we inventio is one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.540" end="00:03:32.450" style="s2">the central functions of dialectic it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:33.500" style="s2">we invent here that&#39;s a reanimation if</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.450" end="00:03:36.230" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.500" end="00:03:38.660" style="s2">technology it has to be able to reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.230" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">you all over the place if it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.660" end="00:03:42.230" style="s2">be effective and functional for us I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:45.170" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a pivotal</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.230" end="00:03:47.630" style="s2">point you just made there I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.170" end="00:03:50.510" style="s2">it&#39;s inflationary at all I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.630" end="00:03:52.940" style="s2">right the job of this is is to exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.510" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">allow us to return to where every we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.940" end="00:03:57.890" style="s2">want to speak and find how to reanimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:00.050" style="s2">it and bring it bring the logos to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.890" end="00:04:02.420" style="s2">because all these concepts become</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.050" end="00:04:04.280" style="s2">lifeless and innocence and they become</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.420" end="00:04:07.310" style="s2">clichés and they become truisms and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.280" end="00:04:09.950" style="s2">stop meaning something and yet we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.310" end="00:04:12.590" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re deeply meaningful on</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.950" end="00:04:14.270" style="s2">some level but but we stop we stop using</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.590" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">them in any meaningful function and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.270" end="00:04:21.770" style="s2">only way we could bring them back is by</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:23.810" style="s2">let&#39;s say redefining them well I like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.770" end="00:04:26.510" style="s2">also is not just redefining the words</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:29.480" style="s2">it&#39;s redefining how we see the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.510" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">yes yes and and and we and reforming</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.480" end="00:04:33.560" style="s2">ourselves in the face of that well what</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:36.710" style="s2">kind of transformation do we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:38.120" style="s2">undergo to conform to the reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.710" end="00:04:40.670" style="s2">being disclosed because whenever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.120" end="00:04:43.640" style="s2">a disclosure there&#39;s also a demand on us</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.670" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">in that we need to conform to that new</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.640" end="00:04:47.270" style="s2">disclosure if we&#39;re gonna realize it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:49.610" style="s2">so I think what I want what I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.270" end="00:04:51.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve provided me a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.610" end="00:04:52.700" style="s2">reframing what I was saying earlier I</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.230" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">think there&#39;s a better way of saying it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.700" end="00:04:57.620" style="s2">I want to try and reinvent you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.500" end="00:04:59.420" style="s2">argumentation so that it&#39;s no it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.620" end="00:05:01.730" style="s2">longer what it has become which is you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.420" end="00:05:03.290" style="s2">know you know just the logical coherence</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.730" end="00:05:05.630" style="s2">of propositions in order to just</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.290" end="00:05:07.580" style="s2">establish a conclusion that&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.630" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">to defeat your enemy I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.580" end="00:05:12.710" style="s2">understand what was going on in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:14.540" style="s2">Socratic use of argumentation because</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.710" end="00:05:16.250" style="s2">very often those arguments don&#39;t come to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.540" end="00:05:19.250" style="s2">conclusions in fact the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.250" end="00:05:23.630" style="s2">devolve into something else yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.250" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">problem perhaps with arguments generally</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.630" end="00:05:28.610" style="s2">as yeah as you say the rival risks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:30.590" style="s2">they&#39;re painful</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.610" end="00:05:32.420" style="s2">whereas I probably a good argument if</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.590" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">you come into the right spirit probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.420" end="00:05:37.160" style="s2">has some kind of a joy associated with</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.430" end="00:05:38.330" style="s2">it if the two like people are having a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.160" end="00:05:41.720" style="s2">wrestling match</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.330" end="00:05:43.580" style="s2">you know you might disagree but I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.720" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">we&#39;re afraid to kind of disagree and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.580" end="00:05:49.730" style="s2">we&#39;re in the social media age we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:53.270" style="s2">afraid to wrestle with each other on</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.730" end="00:05:54.890" style="s2">some level so you know the plato&#39;s use a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.270" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">nickname because he was it means broad</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.890" end="00:06:00.320" style="s2">shoulder because he was a wrestler late</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:02.600" style="s2">on right I&#39;m a martial artist and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.320" end="00:06:03.920" style="s2">yeah the point I was saying this in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.600" end="00:06:06.440" style="s2">workshop yesterday the point is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.920" end="00:06:09.170" style="s2">being right the point is to come into</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.440" end="00:06:11.420" style="s2">right relationship both with the topic</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.420" end="00:06:17.090" style="s2">originally met respect spec t arrest to</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:19.040" style="s2">see the thing properly it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.090" end="00:06:20.870" style="s2">the same thing as a uni B and I said</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.040" end="00:06:22.610" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do is steer a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.870" end="00:06:25.190" style="s2">middle path a very Buddhist notion</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.610" end="00:06:27.230" style="s2">between merely attacking people or</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.190" end="00:06:30.110" style="s2">merely agreeing with them we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.230" end="00:06:31.940" style="s2">instead to afford each of us getting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.110" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">a place where we can&#39;t get to on our own</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.940" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">right because if we have too much</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:39.060" style="s2">agreement then we fall into a bubble of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:42.900" style="s2">some kind yes yes you know and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.060" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">very dull and and cliche but if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.900" end="00:06:47.880" style="s2">too antagonistic then we just you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:50.850" style="s2">then it&#39;s just bloody blood everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.880" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2">and well nothing that&#39;s nothing we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.850" end="00:06:56.190" style="s2">develop friendships and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.300" end="00:06:59.669" style="s2">thing well there&#39;s no conduction to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.190" end="00:07:00.990" style="s2">respect and I want to I want to reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.669" end="00:07:02.669" style="s2">yo that because it&#39;s also been</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.990" end="00:07:08.040" style="s2">trivialized by some of the social dusts</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.669" end="00:07:09.450" style="s2">just as discourse and but notice again</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.040" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">to resonate with another topic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.450" end="00:07:13.729" style="s2">going to hopefully bring into discussion</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:16.200" style="s2">today notice how both agreement and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.729" end="00:07:18.510" style="s2">antagonism lead to an ugliness of speech</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.200" end="00:07:20.790" style="s2">right the one is the ugliness of dead</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.510" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">conformity the ugh the other is the you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.790" end="00:07:25.860" style="s2">know the ugliness of confrontation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:28.460" style="s2">threat and again trying to instead get</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.860" end="00:07:30.660" style="s2">back to what it is to beautify speech I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.460" end="00:07:32.340" style="s2">want it I want I want to try and get</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.660" end="00:07:35.700" style="s2">argumentation that and Kris and I were</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.340" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">talking about this is like that but my</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.700" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">thinking isn&#39;t set and then I speak it</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:44.070" style="s2">to convince you it&#39;s instead as I try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:45.750" style="s2">articulate to you my thoughts my</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.070" end="00:07:47.820" style="s2">thoughts I&#39;m actually reinvent yelling</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.750" end="00:07:50.010" style="s2">my thoughts that in speaking them I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.820" end="00:07:51.810" style="s2">discover something in the speaking that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.010" end="00:07:53.510" style="s2">I didn&#39;t have before I spoke them to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.810" end="00:07:56.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m really trying to get out</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.510" end="00:07:57.690" style="s2">so this red metaphor mm-hmm the rest</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.550" end="00:07:59.610" style="s2">thing metaphor works well for that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:02.130" style="s2">purpose too because if you think every</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.610" end="00:08:04.169" style="s2">particular proposition every proposed</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.130" end="00:08:05.970" style="s2">speech Act and the way that you and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.169" end="00:08:08.250" style="s2">have talked about it John makes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.970" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">particular space in the interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.250" end="00:08:14.060" style="s2">so the entire form of the dialogue is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:17.550" style="s2">act of spatialization right that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.060" end="00:08:20.700" style="s2">test the spatial awareness of your body</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.550" end="00:08:24.180" style="s2">even as you exert and are exerted by</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.700" end="00:08:26.340" style="s2">your dialogic partners so the co plates</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:29.490" style="s2">or the co creative act is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:31.530" style="s2">act of of using the form of embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.490" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">in this case the embodiment of speech</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.530" end="00:08:36.539" style="s2">itself as a way of making exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:38.430" style="s2">space to then venture ever further ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.539" end="00:08:40.260" style="s2">further ever further into that space and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.430" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">definitional discussions are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.260" end="00:08:43.890" style="s2">for that reason because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:46.830" style="s2">thinking of the definition of a term as</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.890" end="00:08:48.690" style="s2">a multi vocalist soul or dialogue or</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.830" end="00:08:52.050" style="s2">love or any of the things that we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.690" end="00:08:52.680" style="s2">be able to to put into this arena and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.050" end="00:08:56.339" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.680" end="00:08:58.170" style="s2">rest with our really it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.339" end="00:09:00.510" style="s2">helpful to think metaphorically of each</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.170" end="00:09:03.779" style="s2">of these definitions as spaces in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.510" end="00:09:06.660" style="s2">to play that the definition is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.779" end="00:09:09.089" style="s2">to be inhabited in order to then Illume</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.660" end="00:09:12.839" style="s2">more territory around it as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.089" end="00:09:15.300" style="s2">something that we treat as as leading to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.839" end="00:09:16.770" style="s2">a fixed point of closure I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.300" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">exactly right because and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.770" end="00:09:21.300" style="s2">so cuz when I was doing the workshop I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:23.430" style="s2">tried to move people I made people</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.300" end="00:09:25.770" style="s2">actually engage in the speaker to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.430" end="00:09:27.959" style="s2">remember that proposition originally</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.770" end="00:09:31.709" style="s2">comes from the speech octave I proposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.959" end="00:09:35.250" style="s2">which is not the same thing as this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.709" end="00:09:38.490" style="s2">the case right very different things I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.250" end="00:09:39.899" style="s2">try to bring that back out with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.490" end="00:09:41.820" style="s2">it&#39;s the Metin it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.899" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">metonymy again right everything is put</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.820" end="00:09:48.300" style="s2">for something greater put for something</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:49.500" style="s2">beyond it so everything if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.300" end="00:09:51.240" style="s2">acknowledgment that every proposition</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.500" end="00:09:52.980" style="s2">every gesture in the dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.240" end="00:09:55.170" style="s2">abbreviated knowingly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.980" end="00:09:57.029" style="s2">self-consciously abbreviated then it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.170" end="00:10:00.510" style="s2">always has its eye fixed beyond its</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.029" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">point of meaning mmm beautiful yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.510" end="00:10:06.839" style="s2">so it never becomes reified or stuck</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:09.480" style="s2">yeah and and and there&#39;s always a living</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.839" end="00:10:12.089" style="s2">force moving through it which again I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.480" end="00:10:14.970" style="s2">think all of these things keep coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.089" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">together in my mind which leads to soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.970" end="00:10:20.610" style="s2">and beauty because yeah well because</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:23.730" style="s2">what has soul is is what it what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.610" end="00:10:25.529" style="s2">alive right what is what continues to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.730" end="00:10:27.390" style="s2">move through us and and what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.529" end="00:10:29.580" style="s2">beautiful is also what is alive inand</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.390" end="00:10:32.279" style="s2">what what is meaningful and not what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.580" end="00:10:37.050" style="s2">stuck and frozen and broken and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.279" end="00:10:40.980" style="s2">fragmented and and ugly and right know</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.050" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t mean to that this is I I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.980" end="00:10:44.910" style="s2">just was you I was excited when you said</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:46.380" style="s2">you know all of these things are coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.910" end="00:10:48.450" style="s2">together in your mind because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.380" end="00:10:50.010" style="s2">original meaning of logos bring things</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.450" end="00:10:52.290" style="s2">together so that they come to belong</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.010" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">together and that&#39;s something much much</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.290" end="00:10:56.459" style="s2">more than what we&#39;ve reduced it to logos</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">is the basis of our word logic and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.459" end="00:11:00.060" style="s2">reduced that to a coherence between</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:02.040" style="s2">propositions but what you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.060" end="00:11:03.750" style="s2">about there Andrew about how things come</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.040" end="00:11:05.560" style="s2">together so they belong together and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.750" end="00:11:07.779" style="s2">they&#39;re in sold together and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.560" end="00:11:10.150" style="s2">live together that&#39;s the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.779" end="00:11:13.000" style="s2">logos and logical coherence is only one</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.150" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">aspect of that much richer manifold</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:20.080" style="s2">right so we&#39;re trying to reinvent logos</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:23.080" style="s2">yet all right to mean something not not</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.080" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">in this narrow logic just a logicians</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.080" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">kind of game and we&#39;re also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:32.920" style="s2">what about what about my friend</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:35.500" style="s2">Alexander always talks about mythos and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.920" end="00:11:37.690" style="s2">pathos as well sure that those those two</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.500" end="00:11:40.210" style="s2">kind of work together so mythos is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.690" end="00:11:42.550" style="s2">story is the the formal form of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.210" end="00:11:46.570" style="s2">story and pathos is the deep sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.550" end="00:11:48.279" style="s2">feeling aspect to it and and if you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.570" end="00:11:51.670" style="s2">if perhaps if we get too hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.279" end="00:11:53.290" style="s2">logos we lose we lose our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.670" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">feeling and if we get too hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.290" end="00:12:01.570" style="s2">mythos you know the story becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:02.860" style="s2">sealed or closed or I&#39;m making sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.570" end="00:12:05.700" style="s2">here and that all those three need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.860" end="00:12:08.860" style="s2">work together logos mythos and pathos</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.700" end="00:12:11.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s what makes go for it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.860" end="00:12:13.950" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll go ahead I&#39;m just gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.140" end="00:12:16.690" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s the point of the like</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.950" end="00:12:19.770" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing the dialectic when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.690" end="00:12:22.780" style="s2">want reading one of the dialogues the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.770" end="00:12:24.070" style="s2">like you know discipline ik I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.780" end="00:12:26.110" style="s2">really important to do Harlan and others</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.070" end="00:12:27.850" style="s2">have made you you don&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.110" end="00:12:30.250" style="s2">just the argumentation the argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.850" end="00:12:32.620" style="s2">is where you see the putting forth of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.250" end="00:12:35.110" style="s2">propositions but the drama is where you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.620" end="00:12:37.240" style="s2">see a putting forth of ways of life and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.110" end="00:12:39.700" style="s2">drama is exactly where the mythos and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.240" end="00:12:42.700" style="s2">the pathos you that&#39;s why that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.700" end="00:12:44.350" style="s2">Plato does his philosophy in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.700" end="00:12:47.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s only in dialogue that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.350" end="00:12:49.690" style="s2">can get the wedding of the of the drama</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.170" end="00:12:52.300" style="s2">and the discourse so smoothly together</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.690" end="00:12:53.709" style="s2">hmm yes yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.300" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">and only in and only in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.709" end="00:12:58.750" style="s2">dramaturgical context can logos to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:13:01.420" style="s2">a questing character yes there is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.750" end="00:13:03.400" style="s2">implicit narrativity to the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.420" end="00:13:04.750" style="s2">precisely because there&#39;s a quest right</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.400" end="00:13:06.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the dialogues are such</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.750" end="00:13:08.170" style="s2">a beautiful marriage of the logos and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.279" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">the mythos because the characterization</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.170" end="00:13:12.610" style="s2">of the quest of logos is implicit to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:15.250" style="s2">function of the dialog itself yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.610" end="00:13:17.589" style="s2">questions which are propositional are</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.250" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">actually just the affordance of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.589" end="00:13:22.279" style="s2">speech act thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">of questing that&#39;s exactly the right way</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.279" end="00:13:28.759" style="s2">to put it Chris I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:31.129" style="s2">good yeah hmm so shall shall I begin</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.759" end="00:13:34.040" style="s2">some of my proposals please please ya</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.129" end="00:13:36.740" style="s2">know maybe maybe let me go through sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.040" end="00:13:38.779" style="s2">of sort of the four main things the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.740" end="00:13:40.670" style="s2">proposals and then we can go back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.779" end="00:13:42.949" style="s2">trace through it a however you gentlemen</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.670" end="00:13:45.740" style="s2">wish to well and then we&#39;ll just follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.949" end="00:13:49.639" style="s2">as Socrates often says we will follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.740" end="00:13:51.110" style="s2">the argument wherever it goes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.639" end="00:13:54.050" style="s2">the first thing I wanted to do was I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.110" end="00:13:55.730" style="s2">wanted to bring up the connection so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.050" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">want to first of all make clear to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.730" end="00:14:00.019" style="s2">everybody who might be listening that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:02.209" style="s2">andrew was very kind to send a set of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.019" end="00:14:03.259" style="s2">questions and I thought originally I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.209" end="00:14:04.939" style="s2">just gonna think about how he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.259" end="00:14:06.920" style="s2">answer each question better than I I</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.939" end="00:14:08.509" style="s2">thought maybe what I should do is try</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.920" end="00:14:10.459" style="s2">and logo so I should try and draw them</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.509" end="00:14:13.579" style="s2">together into mutually supporting</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.459" end="00:14:16.309" style="s2">proposals and so the first so Andrew had</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.579" end="00:14:17.959" style="s2">some questions and he&#39;s just also spoken</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.309" end="00:14:22.879" style="s2">earlier about you know connections</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.959" end="00:14:24.470" style="s2">between beauty and soul and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.879" end="00:14:27.649" style="s2">pick up on our previous discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.470" end="00:14:30.920" style="s2">this idea of the reinvent EO of soul as</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.649" end="00:14:33.110" style="s2">that which mediates Mattacks ooh is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.920" end="00:14:35.480" style="s2">the alog in between us between more</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.110" end="00:14:35.779" style="s2">nests and suchness quite a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.480" end="00:14:38.750" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.779" end="00:14:41.269" style="s2">the mediator yeah yes it was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.750" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">mediator like I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.269" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">this movie metropolis this fairy look</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:47.329" style="s2">what I do you&#39;re talking you talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">mediator as the guy who brings together</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.329" end="00:14:55.399" style="s2">the head and the heart brings together</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:58.579" style="s2">the hearts oh yeah yeah Don has a big</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.399" end="00:15:00.589" style="s2">poster of Metropolis it&#39;s given me the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.579" end="00:15:02.120" style="s2">original like a print of the original</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.589" end="00:15:04.730" style="s2">poster from metropolis that movie just</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.730" end="00:15:06.559" style="s2">beautiful illusion Andrew thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.259" end="00:15:11.420" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.559" end="00:15:13.490" style="s2">okay so always thinking about and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.420" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">when we come back and review the first</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.490" end="00:15:18.110" style="s2">proposal</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.199" end="00:15:20.990" style="s2">I was thinking especially what you said</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.110" end="00:15:22.610" style="s2">because Andrew about Hans book I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.990" end="00:15:25.429" style="s2">saving Beauty because I also think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.610" end="00:15:26.899" style="s2">a really important work and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.429" end="00:15:28.279" style="s2">come back to that but I was thinking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.899" end="00:15:30.199" style="s2">sorry been thinking a lot about beauty</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.279" end="00:15:32.960" style="s2">and of course because it plays this very</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.199" end="00:15:35.360" style="s2">important role and beautification we</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.960" end="00:15:38.390" style="s2">than the dialogues and so I was trying I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:40.940" style="s2">was thinking about the correlation</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.390" end="00:15:43.580" style="s2">between soul and beauty that you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.940" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">making Andrew I want to unpack that in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.580" end="00:15:47.780" style="s2">this proposal so I want to propose to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">you that there&#39;s a continuum there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.780" end="00:15:53.990" style="s2">continuum in our experience in right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.170" end="00:15:58.040" style="s2">now I&#39;m doing a tone us attention right</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.990" end="00:16:01.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuum between experiences</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.040" end="00:16:04.550" style="s2">that emphasize suchness and experiences</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.580" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">that emphasize more Ness so overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.550" end="00:16:11.390" style="s2">more Ness is horror right and then a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">little little less overwhelming is awe a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.390" end="00:16:16.760" style="s2">little less overwhelming is wonder now</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">let&#39;s go on the other side when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.760" end="00:16:20.150" style="s2">really picking up on the suchness people</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:22.970" style="s2">express that with this positive term of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.150" end="00:16:24.680" style="s2">intimacy I know you intimately alright</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.970" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">and then if that&#39;s taken a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.680" end="00:16:30.140" style="s2">deeper you people talk about being at</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:32.120" style="s2">peace with each other and then even more</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.140" end="00:16:33.290" style="s2">deeper a sense of being at home with</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.120" end="00:16:35.090" style="s2">someone and you know Chris what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.290" end="00:16:37.430" style="s2">doing here I&#39;m picking up on right home</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.090" end="00:16:40.820" style="s2">and horror has aspects of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.430" end="00:16:42.920" style="s2">right black veil indeed bar we get that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.820" end="00:16:46.220" style="s2">thing where right it&#39;s all it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.920" end="00:16:48.230" style="s2">too enclosed right when I&#39;m proposing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.220" end="00:16:51.740" style="s2">you is the following beauty is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.230" end="00:16:53.960" style="s2">sweet spot it&#39;s the sweet spot on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.740" end="00:16:57.350" style="s2">continuum it&#39;s kind of a meta optimal</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.960" end="00:16:59.780" style="s2">grip right it&#39;s it&#39;s the tone us between</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.350" end="00:17:02.360" style="s2">being alive to the more nest and wonder</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.780" end="00:17:04.430" style="s2">and being alive to the suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.360" end="00:17:06.170" style="s2">intimacy and this is picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.430" end="00:17:08.450" style="s2">scara&#39;s notion that when I encounter</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.170" end="00:17:10.430" style="s2">something beautiful I both get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.450" end="00:17:12.680" style="s2">of wow they she gives the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.430" end="00:17:14.540" style="s2">tree right all right you come across a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.680" end="00:17:16.100" style="s2">beautiful tree I didn&#39;t know trees could</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.540" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">be like that there&#39;s a sudden more nests</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.100" end="00:17:21.160" style="s2">but this tree is also not like any other</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:24.490" style="s2">tree it has a suchness to it an</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.160" end="00:17:26.570" style="s2">individual to it that is right</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.490" end="00:17:28.040" style="s2">non-repeatable there&#39;s a hereness</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.570" end="00:17:30.350" style="s2">announced that&#39;s precious</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.040" end="00:17:32.030" style="s2">so the intimacy gives a preciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.350" end="00:17:35.330" style="s2">you will allow me not sorry it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.030" end="00:17:37.130" style="s2">golden when I shouldn&#39;t write to them to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.330" end="00:17:40.490" style="s2">the morning so the mortise is not an</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.130" end="00:17:43.430" style="s2">abstract conception it&#39;s it&#39;s presence</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.490" end="00:17:44.810" style="s2">right into the suchness so you see what</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.430" end="00:17:46.730" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do Andrew here I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.810" end="00:17:49.809" style="s2">to propose to you that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.730" end="00:17:53.059" style="s2">faculty of soul that mediates between</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.809" end="00:17:55.580" style="s2">more nests and suchness is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.059" end="00:17:59.690" style="s2">Faculty of the reception of beauty that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.580" end="00:18:01.970" style="s2">because beauty is the aesthetics the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.690" end="00:18:04.220" style="s2">forming of our sensibility that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.970" end="00:18:07.970" style="s2">finding that sweet spot between the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.220" end="00:18:11.630" style="s2">nosov wonder and the intimacy of such</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.970" end="00:18:14.750" style="s2">nests and so I think that picks up on</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.630" end="00:18:17.110" style="s2">scurries notion of how beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.750" end="00:18:19.460" style="s2">actually a deep kind of training for us</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.110" end="00:18:21.860" style="s2">ok so that&#39;s the first proposal the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.460" end="00:18:24.620" style="s2">first proposal is that there&#39;s a deep so</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.860" end="00:18:26.780" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to I think you had a really</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.620" end="00:18:27.830" style="s2">important insight there Andrew and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.780" end="00:18:30.110" style="s2">see what I&#39;m trying to do and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.830" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">propose I don&#39;t unpack it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.110" end="00:18:33.770" style="s2">what the argument is doing it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">here&#39;s some things that I think come</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.770" end="00:18:40.549" style="s2">from that unfold from that so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.340" end="00:18:44.540" style="s2">first proposal is that ok yeah here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.549" end="00:18:47.510" style="s2">the second proposal the second proposal</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.540" end="00:18:50.210" style="s2">is a notion of wisdom that I get from</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.510" end="00:18:52.700" style="s2">Socrates though of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.210" end="00:18:55.460" style="s2">between wisdom and virtue that each</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.700" end="00:18:57.260" style="s2">virtue is just a particular way of being</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.460" end="00:19:00.410" style="s2">wise in a particular kind of situation</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.260" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">so being wise in this situation is to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.410" end="00:19:05.720" style="s2">courageous to be kind in this so to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:09.490" style="s2">wise in this situation is to be kind to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.720" end="00:19:12.169" style="s2">be right so the idea is that virtues our</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.490" end="00:19:14.510" style="s2">particular instantiations pick</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.510" end="00:19:23.059" style="s2">particular context so now making use of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.820" end="00:19:25.700" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s notion of you know a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.059" end="00:19:28.520" style="s2">always being between too much and too</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.700" end="00:19:30.200" style="s2">little mm-hmm no now I&#39;m gonna try and</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.740" end="00:19:43.309" style="s2">self-transcendent aspect and the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.480" end="00:19:47.900" style="s2">had a word for this aspect of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.309" end="00:19:49.490" style="s2">this was Sophia this is the mourners but</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.900" end="00:19:51.530" style="s2">they also had another word that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.490" end="00:19:53.900" style="s2">translated as wisdom and we&#39;ve lost this</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.530" end="00:19:55.309" style="s2">right in our translations as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.900" end="00:19:59.480" style="s2">translate them both by the same word</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.309" end="00:20:00.380" style="s2">they had phronesis and phronesis was the</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.380" end="00:20:06.920" style="s2">fit yourself well to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.540" end="00:20:08.870" style="s2">situation right so Sophia is the morning</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.920" end="00:20:11.330" style="s2">and you see what I&#39;m doing here it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.870" end="00:20:13.820" style="s2">ability to pick up and resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.330" end="00:20:18.370" style="s2">more Ness phronesis is the ability to</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.550" end="00:20:24.590" style="s2">very small and the very big well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.010" end="00:20:28.550" style="s2">the urges it&#39;s the most intimate and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.590" end="00:20:29.660" style="s2">most comprehensive okay yeah so then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.550" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">house of envious</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.660" end="00:20:34.910" style="s2">so let me a spell so the espousal of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:36.890" style="s2">particular virtue in fitness to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.910" end="00:20:38.870" style="s2">particular situation is precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.890" end="00:20:41.030" style="s2">furnaces dimension of wisdom that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.870" end="00:20:43.880" style="s2">right right but it Ignace the fitting</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.030" end="00:20:45.700" style="s2">ness of that&#39;s right but the picking up</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.880" end="00:20:49.940" style="s2">on how there&#39;s always so much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.700" end="00:20:51.650" style="s2">behind any aspect of wisdom right that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.940" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more to being kind that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.650" end="00:20:57.560" style="s2">what then what just happened here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.260" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">the Sophia because the kindness that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.560" end="00:21:02.360" style="s2">show towards Andrew is not the kindness</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.580" style="s2">that I show towards my son and it is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.360" end="00:21:07.070" style="s2">the kindness that I show towards my</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.580" end="00:21:09.920" style="s2">partner or the kindness I show towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.070" end="00:21:12.770" style="s2">my student right there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.920" end="00:21:15.290" style="s2">kindness but notice that&#39;s the Sophia</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.770" end="00:21:17.180" style="s2">but being kind to Andrew in the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.290" end="00:21:19.880" style="s2">way as distinct from how I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.180" end="00:21:21.410" style="s2">Spencer right that&#39;s the phoniest did</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.880" end="00:21:25.100" style="s2">that work did that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.410" end="00:21:28.930" style="s2">mm-hmm absolutely so now I can put these</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.100" end="00:21:33.620" style="s2">two together virtue is the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.930" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">wisdom because Verte beauty is to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.620" end="00:21:38.620" style="s2">the more nests it&#39;s a sweet spot between</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:41.960" style="s2">the more nests and the suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.620" end="00:21:43.940" style="s2">wisdom right is virtue is where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.960" end="00:21:47.810" style="s2">bring the more nests into the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.940" end="00:21:53.330" style="s2">that&#39;s what virtue is so virtue is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.810" end="00:21:55.550" style="s2">beauty of wisdom virtue as this is why</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.330" end="00:21:58.190" style="s2">Plato says you start first by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.550" end="00:21:59.930" style="s2">the beauty of physical things and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.190" end="00:22:01.490" style="s2">what the physical things in have in</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.930" end="00:22:03.230" style="s2">common and then he moves this move which</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.490" end="00:22:05.450" style="s2">many people have promised serious but he</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:08.840" style="s2">and goes to say then you consider the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:11.210" style="s2">beauty of virtue but that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.840" end="00:22:13.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the move that gets you in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.210" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2">the best the form of beauty that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.040" end="00:22:16.220" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">wisdom and this is the beautification</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.220" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">this is the kind of beauty that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">trying to make right in dialectic okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:27.830" style="s2">so that&#39;s the third proposal that virtue</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:29.960" style="s2">is the beauty of wisdom so this leads me</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.830" end="00:22:32.300" style="s2">to the fourth proposal and you see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.960" end="00:22:34.520" style="s2">this is so this is right that this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.300" end="00:22:36.770" style="s2">also an instalment process ender this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.520" end="00:22:39.560" style="s2">exam --all taneous lis right because</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.770" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">virtue virtue it is again that process</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.560" end="00:22:47.900" style="s2">of mediating appropriately between war</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:50.560" style="s2">and the Sun mm-hmm okay so dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.900" end="00:22:52.610" style="s2">here&#39;s the proposal the fourth proposal</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.560" end="00:22:54.440" style="s2">notice how this is not a strictly</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.610" end="00:22:56.660" style="s2">logically coherent argument it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.440" end="00:22:57.950" style="s2">argument but it&#39;s at logos argument on</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.660" end="00:22:59.330" style="s2">gathering things together and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.950" end="00:23:02.540" style="s2">gathering together and gathering</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.330" end="00:23:05.330" style="s2">together right dialectic is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.540" end="00:23:08.930" style="s2">beautification of thought in speech in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.330" end="00:23:12.860" style="s2">order to conform to virtue and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.930" end="00:23:14.150" style="s2">how we practice wisdom so dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.860" end="00:23:16.910" style="s2">the beautification of thought and speech</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.150" end="00:23:18.650" style="s2">in order to conform to virtue and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.910" end="00:23:21.650" style="s2">is how we practice and wisdom what does</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.650" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">this imply dialectic is about virtue in</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.650" end="00:23:27.800" style="s2">two senses virtue is always the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:30.170" style="s2">every dialectic and it is every dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.800" end="00:23:32.660" style="s2">is about a virtue it is look the topic</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.170" end="00:23:34.820" style="s2">and it is the enacted tonus we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.660" end="00:23:36.740" style="s2">supposed to be talking about courage in</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.820" end="00:23:39.620" style="s2">a dialogue but we are also supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.740" end="00:23:43.130" style="s2">be enacting courage and Socrates always</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.620" end="00:23:46.610" style="s2">exemplifies that in fact the enactment</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.130" end="00:23:48.680" style="s2">of courage takes precedent over right</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.610" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">the topic anything that is spoken about</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.680" end="00:23:53.180" style="s2">courage the speaking and the enactment</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:55.100" style="s2">right the topic and the tono&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.180" end="00:23:59.750" style="s2">wedded together because the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.100" end="00:24:02.540" style="s2">goal is to conform to virtue to love the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.750" end="00:24:04.670" style="s2">beauty of wisdom so that&#39;s that those</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.540" end="00:24:07.390" style="s2">are the four proposals okay I have one</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.670" end="00:24:10.340" style="s2">question about the word virtue because</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.390" end="00:24:12.800" style="s2">it seems to be a word that&#39;s been kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.340" end="00:24:13.780" style="s2">of abused and it has a moralistic tone</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.800" end="00:24:16.190" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.780" end="00:24:19.370" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a bigger word than that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.190" end="00:24:22.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a more virtuous doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.370" end="00:24:23.510" style="s2">being goody two-shoes or something you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.010" end="00:24:25.790" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t mean just being good</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.510" end="00:24:27.830" style="s2">right no no not at all I&#39;m more to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.790" end="00:24:29.809" style="s2">than that so I think maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.830" end="00:24:31.909" style="s2">unpackage define and we should reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.809" end="00:24:33.980" style="s2">virtue as well right what that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.909" end="00:24:35.720" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s pick up on something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.980" end="00:24:38.659" style="s2">everybody&#39;s familiar with virtual</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.720" end="00:24:41.149" style="s2">reality the virtual world why do we use</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.659" end="00:24:45.140" style="s2">that term because the remote the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.149" end="00:24:48.049" style="s2">of virtue is actually a power right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.140" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">a power in act it&#39;s a it&#39;s a potential</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.049" end="00:24:52.519" style="s2">it&#39;s not just mere possibility it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:55.700" style="s2">actually a living potential that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.519" end="00:24:58.909" style="s2">enacted right it&#39;s being actualized so</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.700" end="00:25:01.820" style="s2">the virtue of honesty is to have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.909" end="00:25:04.490" style="s2">potential the set of skills sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.820" end="00:25:06.409" style="s2">and sense of self that when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.490" end="00:25:10.570" style="s2">into a particular situation will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.409" end="00:25:15.139" style="s2">actualized as courage or actualized as</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.570" end="00:25:18.950" style="s2">honesty that&#39;s what a virtue means which</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.139" end="00:25:21.139" style="s2">explains why the virtues are associated</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.950" end="00:25:23.240" style="s2">with the Platonic forms because of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.139" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">putana forms are these exponent powers</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.240" end="00:25:29.179" style="s2">of knowing then the expression knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:29.809" style="s2">in virtue yes all of a sudden makes a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.179" end="00:25:32.059" style="s2">whole lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.809" end="00:25:34.100" style="s2">exactly and notice that we do that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.059" end="00:25:39.620" style="s2">we&#39;re knowing in virtue of we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.100" end="00:25:41.149" style="s2">this in virtue of exactly exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.620" end="00:25:43.100" style="s2">what I what I&#39;m trying to do in Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.149" end="00:25:45.799" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do the I&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.100" end="00:25:47.750" style="s2">this thing and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.799" end="00:25:48.950" style="s2">succeeding or not it&#39;s like an open but</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.750" end="00:25:51.769" style="s2">you see what I&#39;m trying instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.950" end="00:25:53.779" style="s2">giving you you know sentences about your</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.769" end="00:25:55.190" style="s2">particular question I&#39;m trying to logo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.779" end="00:25:56.840" style="s2">them together I&#39;m trying to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.190" end="00:25:58.789" style="s2">together so they belong together and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.840" end="00:26:01.690" style="s2">they unfold and they take on a life of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.789" end="00:26:04.039" style="s2">their own and and and and they afford</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.690" end="00:26:06.139" style="s2">exploration they afford more discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.039" end="00:26:09.320" style="s2">they afford more conversation I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.320" end="00:26:12.679" style="s2">when you were talking about potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.940" end="00:26:16.429" style="s2">and relating that to virtue I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.679" end="00:26:20.330" style="s2">thinking about soul again yeah and I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.429" end="00:26:22.429" style="s2">thinking that the soul is kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.330" end="00:26:25.190" style="s2">echo of the future of your future</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.429" end="00:26:26.890" style="s2">potential of the beauty that you could</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.190" end="00:26:29.110" style="s2">become yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.890" end="00:26:31.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s well said notice what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.110" end="00:26:34.029" style="s2">just done you know when you said you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.240" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">know this of your potential futures</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.029" end="00:26:37.960" style="s2">you&#39;re gesturing towards the nor more</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:40.179" style="s2">Ness but you&#39;re talking about what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.960" end="00:26:41.740" style="s2">could become like so the morning is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.179" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">mystery of participation it&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.740" end="00:26:46.390" style="s2">unfold into being but the suchness is</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:48.460" style="s2">the mystery of our individuation how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.390" end="00:26:50.200" style="s2">become what we particularly are what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.460" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">individually are until it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.200" end="00:26:53.980" style="s2">insight right is that that&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:56.710" style="s2">that&#39;s the fundamental grammar the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.980" end="00:26:58.870" style="s2">fundamental tonus of human existence</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.710" end="00:27:02.250" style="s2">we&#39;re always in tension between</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.870" end="00:27:07.269" style="s2">individuation and participation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.250" end="00:27:11.130" style="s2">beauty is a way in which we enact a and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.269" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">become virtuous within that tension</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.130" end="00:27:16.360" style="s2">within that tension hmm so sorry</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:18.789" style="s2">actually argues in her book not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.360" end="00:27:20.830" style="s2">beauty is truth or goodness</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.789" end="00:27:22.330" style="s2">she says that beauty and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.830" end="00:27:24.190" style="s2">her core arguments and inspired what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.330" end="00:27:26.470" style="s2">was saying here the beauty is basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.190" end="00:27:29.169" style="s2">where we practice being just and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.470" end="00:27:31.659" style="s2">practice looking for the truth we</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.169" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">practice the show we Pro she uses these</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.659" end="00:27:36.639" style="s2">what she&#39;s basically saying is beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:39.159" style="s2">where we practice the kind of seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.639" end="00:27:42.970" style="s2">being and talking and thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.159" end="00:27:45.700" style="s2">prepares us for for when you know moral</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.970" end="00:27:47.769" style="s2">virtues like honesty or which is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.700" end="00:27:50.740" style="s2">also an intellectual virtue and also</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.769" end="00:27:52.389" style="s2">intellectual virtues like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.740" end="00:27:54.639" style="s2">know wisdom and things like that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.389" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">prepares us for both of those it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.639" end="00:27:58.929" style="s2">basically the schoolhouse for both the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:00.190" style="s2">intellectual and the moral virtues and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.929" end="00:28:02.350" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.190" end="00:28:04.330" style="s2">here because I think she&#39;s articulating</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.350" end="00:28:07.000" style="s2">something beautiful that was a central</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.330" end="00:28:08.710" style="s2">idea in Plato I&#39;m not signed of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.000" end="00:28:10.269" style="s2">counterintuitive to how we think of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.710" end="00:28:12.429" style="s2">beauty we kind of think of beauty as</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.269" end="00:28:15.100" style="s2">something primordial that has nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.429" end="00:28:18.250" style="s2">do with yeah you know you know any kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.100" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">of moral virtues it&#39;s just it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.250" end="00:28:22.779" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have moral virtues it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:26.409" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s the it&#39;s just a flower it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.779" end="00:28:29.019" style="s2">it&#39;s just bare bare truth that brings up</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.409" end="00:28:31.090" style="s2">Han right that brings up on so notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.019" end="00:28:32.980" style="s2">what what Han sang with the aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.090" end="00:28:35.350" style="s2">of the smooth right how he said how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.980" end="00:28:38.020" style="s2">reduce Beauty to things being smooth</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.350" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">right because smooth is comforting it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.020" end="00:28:43.549" style="s2">challenges us in no way no</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:45.889" style="s2">so what he&#39;s and what to use my language</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.549" end="00:28:49.009" style="s2">one of his complaints is because he uses</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.889" end="00:28:50.419" style="s2">l tara t he says we&#39;ve lost the more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.009" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">using my language now but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.419" end="00:28:53.659" style="s2">perfectly consonant with it we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:57.500" style="s2">the mourners of beauty and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.659" end="00:28:59.690" style="s2">the pay flows also yes and so we the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.500" end="00:29:02.299" style="s2">smooth to smoothness II he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.690" end="00:29:04.519" style="s2">Jeff Koons and his like balloon his</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.299" end="00:29:06.470" style="s2">balloon dogs and they&#39;re all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.519" end="00:29:08.570" style="s2">they&#39;re very cute and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.470" end="00:29:10.789" style="s2">colorful and but there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.570" end="00:29:13.309" style="s2">they&#39;re not like Rodin they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.789" end="00:29:15.169" style="s2">that gravity right no there&#39;s no they</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.309" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">don&#39;t have this like intense gravity</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.169" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">that that that that Beauty also has like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:23.090" style="s2">it does pull you it doesn&#39;t just send</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:28.700" style="s2">you off into bliss it also brings you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.090" end="00:29:30.769" style="s2">into into the earth as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.700" end="00:29:33.409" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right right so what I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.769" end="00:29:34.940" style="s2">picking up on and horn is smoothness I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.409" end="00:29:38.210" style="s2">mean think about would like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.940" end="00:29:40.429" style="s2">smoothness of caress so smoothness marks</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.210" end="00:29:42.440" style="s2">out a kind of intimacy but it&#39;s intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.429" end="00:29:44.929" style="s2">without challenge it&#39;s an intimacy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.440" end="00:29:47.210" style="s2">this is Hans point it is deadening right</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.929" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s deadening because they&#39;re the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.210" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">way in which beauty right finds the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:55.190" style="s2">suchness and the mortis to each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:57.169" style="s2">the educational aspect he deuce to draw</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.190" end="00:29:59.659" style="s2">out that&#39;s being left out of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.169" end="00:30:01.970" style="s2">that&#39;s Hans main completed beauty as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.659" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">veil it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.970" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">everything being presented to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">always behind a veil that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:10.419" style="s2">because it&#39;s always got mourners to it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:14.029" style="s2">think about the veil again the veil</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.419" end="00:30:16.460" style="s2">again it connotes an intimacy but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.029" end="00:30:17.990" style="s2">also right there&#39;s a beyond this right</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.460" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in which it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.990" end="00:30:21.950" style="s2">the mortise it recedes from you and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:24.169" style="s2">challenges you it draws you forth it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.950" end="00:30:26.389" style="s2">puts a demand on you every disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.169" end="00:30:28.429" style="s2">from it puts a demand on you to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.389" end="00:30:30.559" style="s2">through transformation to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.429" end="00:30:32.629" style="s2">conformity with what has been disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:34.669" style="s2">and that&#39;s the training for virtue</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.629" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the training for truth that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.669" end="00:30:41.210" style="s2">training for goodness beauty and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:43.039" style="s2">is what actually trains us it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.210" end="00:30:46.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the common educational</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.039" end="00:30:49.369" style="s2">ancestor of the pursuit of truth and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.460" end="00:30:52.759" style="s2">pursuit of goodness yeah he also said</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.369" end="00:30:53.990" style="s2">Han that within the smooth right we</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.759" end="00:30:56.210" style="s2">don&#39;t even have a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.990" end="00:30:59.270" style="s2">ugliness anymore that&#39;s right there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.210" end="00:31:00.800" style="s2">gravity to ugliness either so and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.270" end="00:31:03.800" style="s2">occurred to me that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.800" end="00:31:05.870" style="s2">understand beauty right we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.800" end="00:31:07.880" style="s2">understand you know the ugliness of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.870" end="00:31:09.920" style="s2">world you know our the ugliness of when</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.880" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">we depart from beauty like we need that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.920" end="00:31:16.550" style="s2">contrast we need that dialectic we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:18.679" style="s2">just you know again this is we this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.550" end="00:31:21.350" style="s2">why you probably mention horror you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.679" end="00:31:25.610" style="s2">in a sense because there&#39;s there there</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.350" end="00:31:29.570" style="s2">is there&#39;s beauty is is is tearing you</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.610" end="00:31:31.820" style="s2">to pieces on some level if it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.570" end="00:31:34.070" style="s2">too far right I and that&#39;s what Rilke</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.820" end="00:31:36.380" style="s2">said right and I but I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.070" end="00:31:38.660" style="s2">pointing to Andrew and I&#39;m gonna shut up</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.380" end="00:31:39.950" style="s2">so Chris can talk but what I think what</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.660" end="00:31:42.170" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to is what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.950" end="00:31:44.170" style="s2">argue for notice that when when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.170" end="00:31:46.520" style="s2">started bringing in and you if you want</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.170" end="00:31:48.920" style="s2">and this is what I think Holly is doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.520" end="00:31:50.120" style="s2">when you want to bring in that contrast</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.920" end="00:31:52.040" style="s2">and you want to enhance it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.120" end="00:31:54.020" style="s2">talking about a normativity you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.040" end="00:31:56.210" style="s2">talking about judgments of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.020" end="00:31:58.370" style="s2">something deeply wrong with ugliness</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.210" end="00:32:00.770" style="s2">there&#39;s something contrast of ly deeply</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.370" end="00:32:02.870" style="s2">right and I think the only way we can do</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.770" end="00:32:05.540" style="s2">that without parts falling into the seal</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.870" end="00:32:09.410" style="s2">definitions is to realign beauty with</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.540" end="00:32:12.410" style="s2">virtue again ugliness is conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.410" end="00:32:15.530" style="s2">Vice as virtue is commute eNOS is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.410" end="00:32:17.690" style="s2">conducive to virtue to virtue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.530" end="00:32:20.210" style="s2">what I want to say mm-hmm that&#39;s gives</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.690" end="00:32:25.400" style="s2">it back its gravitas that gives it back</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.210" end="00:32:28.150" style="s2">its gravitas I think in order for that</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.060" end="00:35:02.819" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting because when I</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.089" end="00:35:05.369" style="s2">was doing the workshop with people well</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.819" end="00:35:07.079" style="s2">because what so what what I when it came</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.369" end="00:35:09.990" style="s2">to me Chris it&#39;s a practical consequence</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.079" end="00:35:11.190" style="s2">of this because I&#39;d always wondered and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.990" end="00:35:12.900" style="s2">you know Cornford and others have made</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.190" end="00:35:14.730" style="s2">Sur this weird thing about Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.900" end="00:35:16.589" style="s2">always wondered why the dialogues always</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.730" end="00:35:18.299" style="s2">figure on virtues either moral virtues</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.589" end="00:35:20.910" style="s2">or intellectual virtues and then I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.299" end="00:35:23.670" style="s2">realized that&#39;s not happenstance</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.910" end="00:35:26.970" style="s2">that is not happenstance the deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.670" end="00:35:28.589" style="s2">has to always be about the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.970" end="00:35:30.900" style="s2">virtue and it always has to be the</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.900" end="00:35:35.009" style="s2">is not happenstance that&#39;s how you get</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.089" end="00:35:38.490" style="s2">the metonymy what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.009" end="00:35:40.109" style="s2">is actually right metonymically related</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.490" end="00:35:42.269" style="s2">to what you&#39;re actually enacting that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.109" end="00:35:44.910" style="s2">that is not a coincidence in this it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.269" end="00:35:46.829" style="s2">necessity of the very constitution of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.910" end="00:35:50.190" style="s2">dialectic we have to be talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.829" end="00:35:52.109" style="s2">virtue as we enact it as we and we and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.190" end="00:35:54.599" style="s2">we resonate between there&#39;s no other way</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.109" end="00:35:55.740" style="s2">right in order in order for the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.599" end="00:35:57.450" style="s2">and the meta meaning to be properly</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.740" end="00:35:58.619" style="s2">affined into relation in order to in</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.619" end="00:36:01.980" style="s2">of the logos to become conversant with</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.750" style="s2">the meaning of the logos the higher</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.289" end="00:36:15.000" style="s2">to the parent if I can put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.630" end="00:36:16.319" style="s2">no I think that&#39;s right so what has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.000" end="00:36:17.490" style="s2">happening with people other people have</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.319" end="00:36:19.079" style="s2">been doing some of these experiments</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.490" end="00:36:20.490" style="s2">about trying to bring argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.079" end="00:36:23.220" style="s2">they just bring in a topic like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.490" end="00:36:25.859" style="s2">problem and it doesn&#39;t go anywhere but</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.220" end="00:36:28.589" style="s2">when I told people I meant in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.859" end="00:36:29.730" style="s2">of instruction I said no no this is what</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.589" end="00:36:31.769" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do we&#39;re gonna break up</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.730" end="00:36:33.059" style="s2">into groups of four right and then what</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.769" end="00:36:35.369" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do is you&#39;re gonna do four</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.059" end="00:36:37.259" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna choose a virtue and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.369" end="00:36:39.690" style="s2">one person is gonna begin by saying and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.259" end="00:36:42.150" style="s2">I propose let&#39;s say honesty is this and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.690" end="00:36:43.859" style="s2">the other person is going to amplify it</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.150" end="00:36:45.329" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna say well can you say a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.859" end="00:36:47.099" style="s2">little bit more or I noticed you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.329" end="00:36:49.529" style="s2">making this gesture they&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.099" end="00:36:51.450" style="s2">and reveal the beauty of how the person</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.529" end="00:36:53.069" style="s2">is enacting it and use that as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.450" end="00:36:56.309" style="s2">scaffold for getting them to say more</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.069" end="00:36:58.769" style="s2">and more and more and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.309" end="00:37:01.289" style="s2">person has to come to a place right</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.769" end="00:37:03.059" style="s2">where right the first person sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.289" end="00:37:04.500" style="s2">said I&#39;m done and the second person says</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.059" end="00:37:05.940" style="s2">well this is how this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.500" end="00:37:07.259" style="s2">understood you to be saying and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.940" end="00:37:09.420" style="s2">have to make sure that they understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.259" end="00:37:11.160" style="s2">them right they have to the other the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.420" end="00:37:12.299" style="s2">first person has to be heard and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.160" end="00:37:14.819" style="s2">they have to the second person has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.299" end="00:37:15.900" style="s2">say what they appreciate about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.819" end="00:37:17.579" style="s2">not only in the sense of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.900" end="00:37:19.769" style="s2">but what was valuable what did they see</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.579" end="00:37:22.470" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t see before and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.769" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">then they have to say what was missing</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.470" end="00:37:27.420" style="s2">yeah but was mysterious what went</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:29.160" style="s2">slightly off and then what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.420" end="00:37:32.190" style="s2">when they and that they do that and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.160" end="00:37:34.500" style="s2">turn to the next person they do what was</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.190" end="00:37:37.470" style="s2">off what was missing and then they make</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.500" end="00:37:39.930" style="s2">proposal about what honesty is and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.470" end="00:37:41.460" style="s2">keep cycling that through people and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.930" end="00:37:43.230" style="s2">then what you do is you get the groups</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.460" end="00:37:45.360" style="s2">and you bring all the groups together</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.230" end="00:37:46.830" style="s2">and this group is doing courage this</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.360" end="00:37:49.380" style="s2">group is doing honesty and you get all</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.830" end="00:37:53.460" style="s2">the groups and you say okay now what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.380" end="00:37:55.350" style="s2">virtue itself and you and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.460" end="00:37:58.350" style="s2">everybody keeps talking about about how</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.350" end="00:38:00.660" style="s2">how they were amazed by how this the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.350" end="00:38:02.820" style="s2">topics just exploded and they felt</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.660" end="00:38:04.500" style="s2">deeply engaged because they&#39;re enacting</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.820" end="00:38:06.330" style="s2">and then they&#39;re seeing them and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.500" end="00:38:07.890" style="s2">and and then they&#39;re all willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.330" end="00:38:09.690" style="s2">this what normally people say they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.890" end="00:38:11.940" style="s2">like to do they&#39;re willing to go into</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.690" end="00:38:15.150" style="s2">this abstract discussion about what what</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.940" end="00:38:16.410" style="s2">is virtue itself it&#39;s an agog a that</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.869" end="00:44:49.900" style="s2">colleagues at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:51.880" style="s2">is all this research showing that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.900" end="00:44:54.160" style="s2">know working with drama working with</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.880" end="00:44:56.309" style="s2">literature is our primary way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.160" end="00:45:00.309" style="s2">training ourselves to be more virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.309" end="00:45:02.799" style="s2">absolutely yeah yeah which also means it</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.309" end="00:45:06.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean again I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.799" end="00:45:10.089" style="s2">away from this sentimental idea of verse</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.450" end="00:45:12.579" style="s2">because because in drop drama is usually</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.089" end="00:45:15.160" style="s2">about going into the human darkness</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.579" end="00:45:17.460" style="s2">right going into the horrors right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.160" end="00:45:21.250" style="s2">often that way I mean a tragedy is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.460" end="00:45:23.319" style="s2">right in any case you know Kurtz goes</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.250" end="00:45:27.430" style="s2">into the the EC&#39;s the horror the horror</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.319" end="00:45:30.309" style="s2">and that&#39;s what Marvel&#39;s so there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.430" end="00:45:33.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not just beauty as as some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.309" end="00:45:36.549" style="s2">really terrible sort of like sentimental</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.250" end="00:45:39.130" style="s2">version of reality it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.549" end="00:45:41.710" style="s2">but look but look at what I always want</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.130" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">to bring gravity to these concepts when</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.710" end="00:45:46.839" style="s2">we talk about them because because they</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:51.160" style="s2">have become because you know if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.839" end="00:45:54.089" style="s2">becomes so Disneyland yeah yeah where</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.160" end="00:45:57.849" style="s2">virtue is the power to lead a good life</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.089" end="00:45:59.890" style="s2">in all the dimensions of goodness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.849" end="00:46:02.289" style="s2">what virtue is it doesn&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.890" end="00:46:05.740" style="s2">moralistic you know think the following</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.289" end="00:46:07.900" style="s2">rules right I&#39;m thinking of you know I</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.740" end="00:46:10.390" style="s2">want to live the kind of life that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.900" end="00:46:12.220" style="s2">Socrates led or the Buddha led or Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.390" end="00:46:15.130" style="s2">of Nazareth led and that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.220" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">captured or reduced to following this</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.130" end="00:46:19.150" style="s2">rule or that ruler or this rule well</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.190" style="s2">it&#39;s an adventure isn&#39;t it it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.150" end="00:46:24.130" style="s2">adventure to look out to look beyond</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.190" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">right and think about Marlowe in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.130" end="00:46:26.970" style="s2">heart of darkness and think about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:28.080" style="s2">beauty of Conrad&#39;s prose</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.970" end="00:46:30.570" style="s2">I know the heart of darkness is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.080" end="00:46:33.090" style="s2">contentious because of colonialism</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.570" end="00:46:35.340" style="s2">racism I&#39;m gonna put that aside because</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.090" end="00:46:37.260" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing to talk about but</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.340" end="00:46:40.110" style="s2">in I mean think about what Marlowe</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.260" end="00:46:42.690" style="s2">represents Marlowe represent virtue in</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.110" end="00:46:45.060" style="s2">the face right of this he because he</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.690" end="00:46:46.920" style="s2">practices self-restraint and he that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.060" end="00:46:48.660" style="s2">not reducible to any sort of fruit you</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.920" end="00:46:50.700" style="s2">know he&#39;s not a prude he&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.660" end="00:46:53.220" style="s2">adopting you know a moralistic set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.700" end="00:46:55.620" style="s2">rules he&#39;s constantly continuing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.220" end="00:46:58.920" style="s2">journey he keeps good faith in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.620" end="00:47:01.800" style="s2">sense with Kurtz but he he dedicates</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.920" end="00:47:04.320" style="s2">himself to remaining right true to his</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.800" end="00:47:06.210" style="s2">humanity he practices he keeps talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.320" end="00:47:08.700" style="s2">about self-restraint he doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.210" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">swallowed by by the horrors but but he</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.700" end="00:47:15.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t avert his gaze either</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:18.300" style="s2">I remember like what was it Kurosawa</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.480" end="00:47:19.980" style="s2">when he was a kid he walked through</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.300" end="00:47:22.410" style="s2">Tokyo after the earthquake and there</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.980" end="00:47:24.690" style="s2">were corpses everywhere and his brother</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.410" end="00:47:28.980" style="s2">said his brother said look look you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.690" end="00:47:32.130" style="s2">to look because because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.980" end="00:47:35.060" style="s2">know the poet doesn&#39;t avert his eyes or</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.130" end="00:47:35.060" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.540" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">Marlow I think Marlow finds a sweet spot</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.610" end="00:47:45.330" style="s2">I thought I&#39;m talking about mm-hmm he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:46.740" style="s2">he but he&#39;s also but he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.330" end="00:47:48.810" style="s2">self-restraint as he maintains that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.740" end="00:47:51.960" style="s2">intimacy with himself he meet he does</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.810" end="00:47:54.330" style="s2">his sickness and he maintains those two</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.960" end="00:47:58.830" style="s2">and that is what actually affords him</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.330" end="00:48:02.150" style="s2">going on the journey the quest and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.830" end="00:48:05.450" style="s2">and how does he like one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.150" end="00:48:07.620" style="s2">formally in which he does all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.450" end="00:48:11.490" style="s2">think about the form of the novella</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.620" end="00:48:15.260" style="s2">itself he&#39;s relaying the story to a</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.490" end="00:48:20.010" style="s2">chorus of of onlookers bearing witness</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.260" end="00:48:22.050" style="s2">to the very to the very character that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.010" end="00:48:22.620" style="s2">he&#39;s conveying right that&#39;s a story with</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.050" end="00:48:24.870" style="s2">a story</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.620" end="00:48:28.590" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why that particular device</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.870" end="00:48:29.730" style="s2">the in framing of the story with its I</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.590" end="00:48:31.230" style="s2">mean we were talking in our last</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.730" end="00:48:32.790" style="s2">conversation together we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.230" end="00:48:36.020" style="s2">about the function of the heavenly host</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.790" end="00:48:39.310" style="s2">to the choral function of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.020" end="00:48:43.540" style="s2">mornin of the choral function of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.310" end="00:48:46.540" style="s2">of witnessing transcendently without</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.540" end="00:48:48.250" style="s2">being enclosed by the the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.540" end="00:48:50.890" style="s2">the character that&#39;s playing through and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.250" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">that and that the way that the novella</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.890" end="00:48:56.350" style="s2">structured lends that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:59.860" style="s2">higher-order perspective that sees the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.350" end="00:49:01.900" style="s2">narrative in virtue of its possibility</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.860" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">of its possible implications of its</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.900" end="00:49:06.670" style="s2">possible meaning beyond its meaning</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:09.160" style="s2">because he relays the story to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.670" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">people on the boat right and they&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.160" end="00:49:12.070" style="s2">they&#39;re not saying anything they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:14.650" style="s2">being they&#39;re silent but there&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.070" end="00:49:17.080" style="s2">bearing silent witness to the very</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.650" end="00:49:18.730" style="s2">dynamic that he&#39;s exemplified and so is</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.080" end="00:49:20.980" style="s2">the reader because the story starts</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.730" end="00:49:23.080" style="s2">reading personal narrator and then takes</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.980" end="00:49:25.240" style="s2">you into that yeah that&#39;s right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.080" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">all the playing with that framing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.240" end="00:49:29.590" style="s2">really good that&#39;s a great observation</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:31.150" style="s2">Chris but well I mean it&#39;s tipped to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.590" end="00:49:35.950" style="s2">your point and you to Andrew it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.150" end="00:49:37.420" style="s2">that there&#39;s a reason why and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.950" end="00:49:41.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.420" end="00:49:43.750" style="s2">sublimity to that and similar narratives</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.710" end="00:49:46.810" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s precise and it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.750" end="00:49:50.710" style="s2">there inexhaustibility right that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.810" end="00:49:54.910" style="s2">the way in which they enact that the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.710" end="00:49:57.730" style="s2">narrative as such in acts patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.910" end="00:49:59.350" style="s2">intimate the morning the narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.730" end="00:50:01.030" style="s2">such and then that more nests beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.350" end="00:50:03.460" style="s2">narrative s such as precisely what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.030" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">enclosed and borne out by the witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.460" end="00:50:08.020" style="s2">presence that surrounds it both the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:11.250" style="s2">reader and perhaps the ancillary</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.020" end="00:50:14.560" style="s2">characters and onlookers and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.250" end="00:50:16.750" style="s2">right Conrad has Marlow and he says that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.560" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">that the Marlow is sitting there like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.750" end="00:50:22.540" style="s2">Buddha at the end right oh that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:28.900" style="s2">in the dark too by the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.540" end="00:50:30.370" style="s2">dark well yeah yeah yeah yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.900" end="00:50:33.820" style="s2">then there&#39;s the scene where the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.370" end="00:50:37.960" style="s2">meets Mara or something and and is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.820" end="00:50:42.330" style="s2">him exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.960" end="00:50:42.330" style="s2">you know he&#39;s mmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.760" end="00:50:49.820" style="s2">so man drew all right this is my attempt</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.710" end="00:50:53.330" style="s2">to was not like I say I wanted to way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.820" end="00:50:56.230" style="s2">like Ken we bring when somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.330" end="00:50:59.060" style="s2">asking us questions can we reinvent you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.230" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">argumentation not as I&#39;m gonna like</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.060" end="00:51:02.630" style="s2">establish things but what I&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:03.980" style="s2">is logos I&#39;m gonna try and gather a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.630" end="00:51:06.020" style="s2">whole bunch of things together so they</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.980" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">belong together they sing together they</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.020" end="00:51:09.650" style="s2">start to beautify each other and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:11.330" style="s2">they afford discourse and discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.650" end="00:51:13.420" style="s2">involvement that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.330" end="00:51:16.550" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to reinvent EO</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.420" end="00:51:18.380" style="s2">argumentation here mmm the making of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.550" end="00:51:20.020" style="s2">proposals and the consideration of how</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.380" end="00:51:25.730" style="s2">they stick together and belong together</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.020" end="00:51:28.970" style="s2">beyond just logical coherence I was also</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.730" end="00:51:30.260" style="s2">saying go go ahead Chris um I was just</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.970" end="00:51:31.580" style="s2">gonna say it&#39;s interesting because one</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.260" end="00:51:33.560" style="s2">of the things that happens is when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.580" end="00:51:35.570" style="s2">bring you bring these you bring these</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.560" end="00:51:39.170" style="s2">particular definitions in proximity to</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.570" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">one another they okay I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.170" end="00:51:42.020" style="s2">personify them for a minute but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:45.010" style="s2">think it&#39;s inappropriate to given all a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.020" end="00:51:47.630" style="s2">discussion about character they begin to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.010" end="00:51:50.740" style="s2">the virtues when they&#39;re brought into</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.630" end="00:51:56.380" style="s2">within range of one another</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.740" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">allow us to see they allow us to to I</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.380" end="00:52:00.859" style="s2">mean the the the way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">become an conversant is that the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.859" end="00:52:05.690" style="s2">begin to know in virtue of one another</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:09.130" style="s2">yes right so the so so so one virtue</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.690" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">begins to know in virtue of its of its</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.130" end="00:52:16.970" style="s2">neighboring virtue and is then so in is</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:18.560" style="s2">then so articulated it&#39;s it&#39;s a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.970" end="00:52:19.970" style="s2">knowing in virtue of another virtue</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.560" end="00:52:21.380" style="s2">which sounds like a mouthful but</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.970" end="00:52:23.359" style="s2">essentially at once you bring these</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.380" end="00:52:26.030" style="s2">things into proximity they begin to know</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.359" end="00:52:27.500" style="s2">by means of one another and in being so</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.030" end="00:52:29.750" style="s2">known by means of one another</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.500" end="00:52:34.220" style="s2">they&#39;re the shared reflections of depth</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.750" end="00:52:36.740" style="s2">begin to appreciate this is a point in</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.220" end="00:52:39.109" style="s2">both the Neoplatonic Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.740" end="00:52:42.230" style="s2">and the Buddhist teaching tradition so</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.109" end="00:52:44.119" style="s2">the minutes indras net right yes you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.230" end="00:52:45.560" style="s2">mentioned that in one here I think I</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.119" end="00:52:48.920" style="s2">think Andrew you mentioned that in one</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.560" end="00:52:50.599" style="s2">of our previous yeah Nations everything</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.920" end="00:52:52.820" style="s2">is reflected in everything anything is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.599" end="00:52:54.380" style="s2">reflected at faith is reflected in soul</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.820" end="00:52:57.740" style="s2">which is reflected in virtue</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.380" end="00:53:00.560" style="s2">which is reflected right they all become</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.740" end="00:53:02.780" style="s2">eyes unto the world yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.560" end="00:53:05.480" style="s2">Platonists says right that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.780" end="00:53:07.850" style="s2">forms are have exactly that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.480" end="00:53:09.710" style="s2">to each other they&#39;re all like indras</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.850" end="00:53:12.020" style="s2">Nets they&#39;re all reflect and each one</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.710" end="00:53:14.810" style="s2">captures the mornin its own particular</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.020" end="00:53:17.810" style="s2">suchness and but it for bright for us it</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.810" end="00:53:20.120" style="s2">has to unfold in time but for in you</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.810" end="00:53:23.150" style="s2">know for Platonists that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.120" end="00:53:25.610" style="s2">happening sort of in eternity and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.150" end="00:53:29.210" style="s2">logos of eternity that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.610" end="00:53:31.460" style="s2">holographic intelligibility we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.210" end="00:53:33.890" style="s2">try and capture it in the sequential</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.460" end="00:53:36.770" style="s2">logos of speech as best we can and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.890" end="00:53:38.870" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what so that metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.770" end="00:53:41.090" style="s2">exactly the resident metaphor the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.870" end="00:53:44.510" style="s2">that virtue speak to me Chavez speaks</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.090" end="00:53:49.640" style="s2">right the ground of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.510" end="00:53:52.910" style="s2">itself which is then again echoes with</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.640" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">the analogy of the dialogic practice of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.910" end="00:54:00.050" style="s2">the two conversation partners so as as</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.480" end="00:54:02.570" style="s2">we as we do as we do between ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.050" end="00:54:04.430" style="s2">as conversation partners so then do the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.570" end="00:54:07.610" style="s2">virtues in forgive each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.430" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">exactly exactly I like that turn of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.610" end="00:54:09.860" style="s2">phrase the virtues in virtue of each</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.440" end="00:54:11.540" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.860" end="00:54:14.450" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful Chris the way you do</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.540" end="00:54:18.560" style="s2">that is so impressive well I&#39;m just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.450" end="00:54:22.130" style="s2">just riffing off of you riffing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.560" end="00:54:24.830" style="s2">exactly the right thing as of this the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.130" end="00:54:28.910" style="s2">Jazz of this is you know constitutive of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.830" end="00:54:31.100" style="s2">its beautification it&#39;s not just riffing</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.910" end="00:54:33.770" style="s2">it&#39;s integral to what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.100" end="00:54:35.570" style="s2">and and that was what&#39;s really a and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.770" end="00:54:37.700" style="s2">when when we did the workshop and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.570" end="00:54:39.740" style="s2">got to people at the end they were</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.700" end="00:54:43.430" style="s2">riffing off their own particular virtue</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.740" end="00:54:46.130" style="s2">that they discussed courage or honesty</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.430" end="00:54:48.430" style="s2">but they were they were jazzing they</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.130" end="00:54:51.380" style="s2">were they were finding resonance and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.430" end="00:54:53.570" style="s2">convergence right and divergence but in</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.380" end="00:54:55.130" style="s2">a harmonious fashion between each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.570" end="00:54:56.930" style="s2">they were doing with the deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.130" end="00:54:58.690" style="s2">they were converging and varying and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.930" end="00:55:03.890" style="s2">converging and varying it was beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.690" end="00:55:06.440" style="s2">yeah hmm and and sometimes you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.890" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">like it when some jazz music just falls</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.440" end="00:55:10.440" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:12.330" style="s2">psychedelic music or sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.440" end="00:55:13.890" style="s2">what I like I listen to these like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.330" end="00:55:16.830" style="s2">Grateful Dead they just fall apart in</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.890" end="00:55:19.230" style="s2">the whole band just disassembles itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.830" end="00:55:20.820" style="s2">completely and and then they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.230" end="00:55:23.130" style="s2">find their way back to each other oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.820" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.130" end="00:55:27.780" style="s2">process that the falling apart and</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:32.220" style="s2">coming back back together like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.780" end="00:55:34.770" style="s2">covering from aporia yeah instead of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.220" end="00:55:37.830" style="s2">going always for the high right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.770" end="00:55:39.870" style="s2">music is always like an orgasmic trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.830" end="00:55:42.420" style="s2">to be an academic type of experience or</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.870" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">complete orgasmic bars whereas the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.420" end="00:55:47.730" style="s2">Jazz is a deeper thing because it</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:51.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always go for the peak right it</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.730" end="00:55:52.020" style="s2">it falls into the valleys in it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.300" end="00:55:55.080" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.020" end="00:55:56.490" style="s2">you know it did it lingers like and</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.080" end="00:55:58.530" style="s2">that&#39;s another word that Han uses I</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.490" end="00:56:00.570" style="s2">think yeah there lingeringly when it</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.530" end="00:56:02.730" style="s2">comes to beauty it lingers awhile and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.570" end="00:56:04.170" style="s2">then it just it&#39;s lets itself go and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.730" end="00:56:07.020" style="s2">then it and then it becomes intense</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.170" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">again and but that&#39;s that&#39;s the Emporia</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.020" end="00:56:10.830" style="s2">as criticality you know in</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:12.150" style="s2">self-organizing systems they get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.830" end="00:56:13.350" style="s2">and what you have to do is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.150" end="00:56:15.300" style="s2">put you have to lifters</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.350" end="00:56:17.400" style="s2">you have to perturb them you have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.300" end="00:56:18.420" style="s2">disturb them yeah right they get to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.400" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">point of criticality where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.420" end="00:56:22.890" style="s2">almost breaking apart falling apart and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:24.840" style="s2">only venture them or something doctor or</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.890" end="00:56:29.420" style="s2">me a puncture is the word that came to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.840" end="00:56:29.420" style="s2">mind yes equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.690" end="00:56:34.140" style="s2">yeah when you were when you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.100" end="00:56:36.810" style="s2">describing initially John you&#39;re open</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.140" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">precis but you know the the equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.810" end="00:56:41.660" style="s2">between the suchness and and the more</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">nasai think of the the complexify</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.660" end="00:56:44.910" style="s2">assimilation and the medic and the medic</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:46.770" style="s2">combination that you talk about within</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.910" end="00:56:48.660" style="s2">within the cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.770" end="00:56:50.430" style="s2">nomenclature and it sounds like virtue</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.660" end="00:56:52.800" style="s2">and fans again maps are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.430" end="00:56:55.410" style="s2">identical it does I think virtue is very</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.800" end="00:56:57.900" style="s2">much about sort of getting that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.410" end="00:57:00.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a meta optimal grip on right meta</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.900" end="00:57:03.720" style="s2">assimilation and met accommodation right</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.870" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">totally and that for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.720" end="00:57:07.890" style="s2">are watching I mean this is discussed at</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:10.050" style="s2">length in some of the videos within my</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.890" end="00:57:11.490" style="s2">within awakening for the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.050" end="00:57:14.310" style="s2">and in some of the stuff that Chris and</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.490" end="00:57:17.430" style="s2">I have written I think we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.310" end="00:57:18.900" style="s2">this in the zombie book don&#39;t we do we I</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.430" end="00:57:21.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.900" end="00:57:23.730" style="s2">think we get we I don&#39;t think we get too</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.730" end="00:57:28.710" style="s2">science vocabulary but yeah it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.490" end="00:57:31.020" style="s2">there somehow yeah do you guys know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.710" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">the work of Rene Girard because one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.020" end="00:57:34.950" style="s2">my question for from before John was and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:38.309" style="s2">one of my thoughts about what beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.950" end="00:57:40.170" style="s2">it&#39;s beyond mimetic desire on some level</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.309" end="00:57:42.150" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s when you when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.170" end="00:57:45.030" style="s2">experience uniqueness that is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.150" end="00:57:46.950" style="s2">imitation of some kind it goes on this</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.030" end="00:57:48.540" style="s2">sort of and that&#39;s what we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.950" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">looking for because we&#39;re always trapped</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.540" end="00:57:53.940" style="s2">in a memetic Hall of Mirrors on some</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:56.010" style="s2">level we&#39;re always we&#39;re copying each</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.010" end="00:58:01.890" style="s2">with with concepts at least I am and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.970" end="00:58:03.690" style="s2">then and we kind of break through and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.890" end="00:58:07.589" style="s2">then we have this fresh moment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.690" end="00:58:09.119" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s beyond yeah mimetic desire</p>

<p begin="00:58:09.119" end="00:58:13.559" style="s2">sense makes total slips and Gerrard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.819" end="00:58:16.410" style="s2">thing I think is it apropos here and his</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.559" end="00:58:19.230" style="s2">idea of you know of Jesus on undermining</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.410" end="00:58:21.059" style="s2">like Jesus being the criticality and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.230" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">think about the word critical in crisis</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.059" end="00:58:24.270" style="s2">and cross and how they&#39;re all related</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:27.030" style="s2">Jesus being the criticality that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.270" end="00:58:28.920" style="s2">disturbs that that whole memetics self</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.030" end="00:58:32.460" style="s2">enclosure I think that that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.920" end="00:58:33.809" style="s2">right because right that&#39;s so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.460" end="00:58:36.809" style="s2">to do is remember that there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.809" end="00:58:39.869" style="s2">not always silent but often silent</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.809" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">partner because if Gerard is I mean his</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.869" end="00:58:43.319" style="s2">prototypical instance of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:45.720" style="s2">talking about mimetic desire is</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.319" end="00:58:48.150" style="s2">covetousness right it&#39;s envy or jealousy</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.720" end="00:58:49.859" style="s2">right Envy yeah he said Envy is the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.150" end="00:58:51.569" style="s2">hidden desire the one we don&#39;t admit to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.859" end="00:58:54.809" style="s2">ourselves so we&#39;re we&#39;re always being</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.569" end="00:58:57.380" style="s2">dragged around right and V so compare</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.809" end="00:59:00.089" style="s2">envy to admiration which is a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.380" end="00:59:02.670" style="s2">what is it when you admire somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.089" end="00:59:07.049" style="s2">you don&#39;t envy them right is it you</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.670" end="00:59:08.609" style="s2">instant so think about arrows as so when</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.049" end="00:59:10.589" style="s2">I want to be one with someone I can</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.609" end="00:59:13.829" style="s2">reduce that to consumption I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.589" end="00:59:15.480" style="s2">one by consuming you more it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.829" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">narrow us that is turning its face</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.480" end="00:59:20.849" style="s2">towards agape I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna generative</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:23.460" style="s2">as because Plato says I&#39;m gonna generate</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.849" end="00:59:26.520" style="s2">beauty within Beauty right so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.460" end="00:59:29.849" style="s2">to try and create a life that you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.520" end="00:59:33.000" style="s2">that is in some relevant sense similar</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.849" end="00:59:33.650" style="s2">to Socrates but not Socrates mmm it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.000" end="00:59:36.140" style="s2">I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.650" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">take from Socrates on trying to generate</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.140" end="00:59:41.690" style="s2">in admiration and so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:44.270" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.690" end="00:59:46.730" style="s2">right if we have a beauty that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.270" end="00:59:49.160" style="s2">smooth that is just the act of</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.730" end="00:59:51.770" style="s2">assimilation consuming making it one</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.160" end="00:59:55.010" style="s2">with me in no way disturbing me in no</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.770" end="00:59:58.250" style="s2">way being a critical moment for me but</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.010" end="01:00:00.529" style="s2">if I have genuine beauty then I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.250" end="01:00:02.390" style="s2">to be drawn beyond myself yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.529" end="01:00:04.849" style="s2">but the critical moment also is</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.390" end="01:00:08.660" style="s2">recognize recognizing one&#39;s Envy at</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.849" end="01:00:11.660" style="s2">times rather than just trying to aspire</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.660" end="01:00:14.510" style="s2">to to an ideal you know state of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.660" end="01:00:17.690" style="s2">admiration is that that we notice that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.510" end="01:00:19.279" style="s2">we feel that in that way a time but that</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.690" end="01:00:21.109" style="s2">but that&#39;s exactly the point</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.279" end="01:00:22.579" style="s2">right it this is to add to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.109" end="01:00:23.859" style="s2">saying about how we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.579" end="01:00:27.740" style="s2">reinvent your virtue</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.859" end="01:00:30.170" style="s2">Socratic virtue is always inseparably</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.740" end="01:00:32.839" style="s2">bound up with self-knowledge right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.170" end="01:00:34.730" style="s2">it&#39;s the kind of its this is this is one</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.839" end="01:00:36.950" style="s2">of the great Socratic insights there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.730" end="01:00:39.500" style="s2">aspects of myself that I can&#39;t know by</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.950" end="01:00:41.299" style="s2">introspection or even reflection I can</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.500" end="01:00:43.250" style="s2">only know them in interaction with you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.299" end="01:00:45.890" style="s2">because they call forth both the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.250" end="01:00:48.049" style="s2">potential for virtue and vice in me then</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.890" end="01:00:50.510" style="s2">I can&#39;t call forth of myself or make</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.049" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">available to myself but if I pay</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.510" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">attention if I come in good faith to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:59.510" style="s2">dialog I can become aware of my Envy and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">I can open myself up to a different</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.510" end="01:01:04.940" style="s2">possibility therein yeah because at that</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:06.770" style="s2">point moment you&#39;re no longer seeing</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.940" end="01:01:08.869" style="s2">through you&#39;re no longer seeing and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.770" end="01:01:14.500" style="s2">knowing by means of your envi when it</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.869" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">becomes opaquely knowable to you as such</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.500" end="01:01:19.940" style="s2">possibility of transcending it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:21.470" style="s2">then available right by knowing it maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.940" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit like the shadow as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.470" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t it about absolutely yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:29.690" style="s2">shadows by how you put you have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:31.609" style="s2">it if you just think you didn&#39;t your</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.690" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">shadow by just doing active imagination</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.609" end="01:01:35.299" style="s2">and sitting inside your room you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:37.549" style="s2">missed Jung&#39;s point you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.299" end="01:01:39.380" style="s2">your shadow when you realize how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.549" end="01:01:41.810" style="s2">projecting onto other people</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.380" end="01:01:44.330" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s only when you recognize your</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.810" end="01:01:48.260" style="s2">projections and hear the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.330" end="01:01:50.510" style="s2">right what way but here the other person</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.260" end="01:01:52.730" style="s2">behind when you projected on them when</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.510" end="01:01:54.800" style="s2">you open up to the other nostalgia</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.730" end="01:01:56.750" style="s2">projection so they can break through the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.800" end="01:01:59.900" style="s2">projection then and only then do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.750" end="01:02:01.310" style="s2">realize your projection yes and then the</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.900" end="01:02:06.760" style="s2">process of doing that could just they</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.310" end="01:02:06.760" style="s2">become dialectical of course of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.660" end="01:02:17.090" style="s2">so so the beauty is is perhaps also a</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.930" end="01:02:19.820" style="s2">moment of deep sincerity right rather</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.090" end="01:02:21.170" style="s2">than let&#39;s say it&#39;s a pretension or yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.820" end="01:02:22.940" style="s2">a totally totally</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.170" end="01:02:25.910" style="s2">I mean that so you know Socratic</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.940" end="01:02:28.550" style="s2">humility is important I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.910" end="01:02:30.260" style="s2">proper I we talked about this last time</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.550" end="01:02:31.640" style="s2">the proper response to beauty is</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.260" end="01:02:33.560" style="s2">reverence and Brett reverence has</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.640" end="01:02:36.620" style="s2">humility within it right</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.560" end="01:02:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s reverence is is this bidirectional</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.620" end="01:02:41.150" style="s2">realization there&#39;s right there you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.960" end="01:02:43.250" style="s2">recognize who you are there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.150" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">intimacy with who you are and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.250" end="01:02:46.910" style="s2">also a recognition of the mourners</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:52.490" style="s2">beyond you that can nevertheless afford</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.910" end="01:02:56.590" style="s2">your transformation and and beauty</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.490" end="01:02:59.960" style="s2">beauty is such - that it it even as it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.590" end="01:03:04.970" style="s2">even if even as it contra distinguishes</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.960" end="01:03:09.140" style="s2">your supreme inadequacy it also saves</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.970" end="01:03:11.270" style="s2">you from it it heals you and it rescues</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.140" end="01:03:15.380" style="s2">you from the interminable death at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.270" end="01:03:19.790" style="s2">same time it is it is it it inflicts</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.380" end="01:03:22.430" style="s2">upon you death without without the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.790" end="01:03:26.600" style="s2">undying death yeah yeah that makes me</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.430" end="01:03:28.340" style="s2">think of Ulysses you know there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.600" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">Homeric version of Allah sees and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.340" end="01:03:36.530" style="s2">there&#39;s James Joyce Ulysses and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:39.800" style="s2">character is so flawed he&#39;s he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.530" end="01:03:41.930" style="s2">human right so we have this ideal and</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.800" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">then we have our you know both those</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.930" end="01:03:48.200" style="s2">things and he becomes the hero just to</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:52.609" style="s2">his mmm I don&#39;t know I guess there was</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.200" end="01:03:55.380" style="s2">that authenticity on someone the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.609" end="01:03:57.390" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s just what came to mind when</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.380" end="01:04:00.150" style="s2">you were speaking about this yeah no I</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.390" end="01:04:03.720" style="s2">like that I think that fits very well so</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.150" end="01:04:06.150" style="s2">so what about the specific proposal of</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.720" end="01:04:08.519" style="s2">because we because there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.150" end="01:04:10.349" style="s2">specific proposal I made about under</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.519" end="01:04:12.989" style="s2">which is part of the reinvent EO of</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.349" end="01:04:15.900" style="s2">beauty and also simultaneously the re</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.989" end="01:04:18.390" style="s2">inventor of virtue to see virtue as the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.900" end="01:04:19.650" style="s2">beauty of wisdom and this is a different</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.390" end="01:04:21.749" style="s2">way I&#39;m trying to propose a different</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.650" end="01:04:24.809" style="s2">way of thinking about both virtue and</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.749" end="01:04:27.089" style="s2">beauty in light of or in virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.809" end="01:04:30.630" style="s2">wisdom itself what do you think about</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.089" end="01:04:32.160" style="s2">that as a proposal because it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.630" end="01:04:33.960" style="s2">been mysterious to me in Plato</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.160" end="01:04:36.269" style="s2">when he talks about the beauty of virtue</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.960" end="01:04:39.720" style="s2">and why we should care about it and why</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.269" end="01:04:42.329" style="s2">it&#39;s superior to sensual beauty but if</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.720" end="01:04:44.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a way in which we refine to wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.329" end="01:04:49.769" style="s2">itself then I can understand why it</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.970" end="01:04:52.529" style="s2">should matter to us so much I think it</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.769" end="01:04:55.799" style="s2">makes it existentially available it</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.529" end="01:04:58.319" style="s2">provides an entree into wisdom what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.799" end="01:05:04.619" style="s2">that is ordinarily the the sohe entre</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.319" end="01:05:08.489" style="s2">virtue the virtue right so the V because</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.619" end="01:05:09.809" style="s2">virtue is both speakable and possessive</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.489" end="01:05:13.619" style="s2">all its participa</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.180" end="01:06:02.219" style="s2">mimesis of that which is not imitatable</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.969" end="01:06:04.630" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a word imitatable</p>

<p begin="01:06:07.150" end="01:06:14.170" style="s2">imitated is precisely what induces the a</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.170" end="01:06:16.390" style="s2">poetic experience oh and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.170" end="01:06:21.340" style="s2">something about inhabiting the virtue</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.390" end="01:06:23.740" style="s2">that is a a and it&#39;s an effort and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.340" end="01:06:26.400" style="s2">like it&#39;s an effort to imitate that</p>

<p begin="01:06:26.400" end="01:06:31.930" style="s2">imitable it is it is the imitation of</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.470" end="01:06:34.150" style="s2">that which is inimitable and that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.930" end="01:06:37.300" style="s2">precisely what induces the Apple Rhea</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.300" end="01:06:43.480" style="s2">makes available the a poetic experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:45.310" style="s2">that is beautiful in its nature is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.480" end="01:06:49.390" style="s2">why you would wear masks in theatre and</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.310" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">in a sense yeah yeah I think that yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.390" end="01:06:52.450" style="s2">yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:56.020" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to imitate</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.450" end="01:06:57.880" style="s2">something the beauty of doing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.020" end="01:07:00.580" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond you on some level</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.880" end="01:07:02.650" style="s2">absolutely I mean theater but also I</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.580" end="01:07:04.810" style="s2">plain I think of literacy as well write</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.650" end="01:07:06.670" style="s2">in a more overtly religious sense right</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.810" end="01:07:08.800" style="s2">you are trying to imitate that which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.670" end="01:07:13.750" style="s2">inimitable you&#39;re trying to you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.800" end="01:07:16.720" style="s2">trying to effect a gesture toward a</p>

<p begin="01:07:19.810" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">a poetic effort you&#39;re teetering on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.850" end="01:07:28.660" style="s2">precipice of intelligibility at that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:31.180" style="s2">moment but precisely that at that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.660" end="01:07:33.250" style="s2">precarious point that precarious edge</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.180" end="01:07:35.080" style="s2">that that beauty walks that as John</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.250" end="01:07:37.540" style="s2">described at that optimal balance of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.080" end="01:07:39.820" style="s2">beauty between the horrific and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.540" end="01:07:41.920" style="s2">confirmed I have to admit I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.820" end="01:07:45.820" style="s2">hard time connecting beauty to wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.920" end="01:07:47.530" style="s2">those two things don&#39;t don&#39;t go together</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.820" end="01:07:49.990" style="s2">for me on some level</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.530" end="01:07:52.060" style="s2">well perhaps again this is my more</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.990" end="01:07:55.500" style="s2">romantic disposition because I always</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.060" end="01:07:58.930" style="s2">think that it&#39;s it&#39;s when you cast off</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.500" end="01:08:02.140" style="s2">when you cast off any pretense of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.930" end="01:08:06.010" style="s2">or non wisdom it&#39;s it&#39;s just a full full</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.140" end="01:08:10.900" style="s2">embrace of some kind but well some</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.010" end="01:08:15.400" style="s2">wisdom feels to me wisdom feels to me a</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.900" end="01:08:17.489" style="s2">step removed of God does that make any</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.400" end="01:08:19.830" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.489" end="01:08:23.969" style="s2">for us perhaps this is me being</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.830" end="01:08:27.350" style="s2">argumentative no this is a good point</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.969" end="01:08:30.120" style="s2">this is a good this is a good point I</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.350" end="01:08:34.319" style="s2">think I think so maybe one place to</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.120" end="01:08:37.739" style="s2">start is that beauty beauty becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.319" end="01:08:42.000" style="s2">way of effecting profound changes in our</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.739" end="01:08:46.850" style="s2">advertent attention right Beauty is what</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.000" end="01:08:46.850" style="s2">calls out and directs our attention and</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.910" end="01:08:51.989" style="s2">attention can be subject to all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.560" end="01:08:54.450" style="s2">self-deceptive patterns patterns that</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.989" end="01:08:57.660" style="s2">recur patterns that are enshrined and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.450" end="01:09:00.540" style="s2">entrenched into forceable habituated</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.660" end="01:09:04.109" style="s2">modes of being or modes of having I</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.540" end="01:09:07.500" style="s2">suppose and what Beauty does is it</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.109" end="01:09:09.870" style="s2">somehow Beauty can debilitate those</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.500" end="01:09:12.390" style="s2">patterns precisely because it can</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.870" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">recover our attention and repurpose it</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.390" end="01:09:16.830" style="s2">and refocus it so I think maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:19.770" style="s2">one way to start is that I think of</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.830" end="01:09:22.170" style="s2">beauty as like the Herald of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.770" end="01:09:24.239" style="s2">right it&#39;s what calls our attention to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.170" end="01:09:27.480" style="s2">it it&#39;s not necessarily identical with</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.239" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">it but it is the very thing that it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.480" end="01:09:34.920" style="s2">the very thing that draws out aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:37.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s capable of of laying waste</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.920" end="01:09:39.750" style="s2">to the particular patterns by which we</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.680" end="01:09:41.850" style="s2">see and know at any given point like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.750" end="01:09:44.009" style="s2">sirens that are calling to like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.850" end="01:09:48.330" style="s2">sirens right which is a great example of</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.009" end="01:09:52.200" style="s2">how it can be used Cyclops versus the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.330" end="01:09:55.550" style="s2">call Ulysses to his doom and somehow he</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.200" end="01:09:58.530" style="s2">has to make it home to us that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.550" end="01:10:01.200" style="s2">to his wife who has been surrounded by</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.530" end="01:10:03.150" style="s2">suitors and all that so it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.200" end="01:10:05.280" style="s2">so so yeah there&#39;s always this I get</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.150" end="01:10:08.760" style="s2">beauty is is is bound up in seduction</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.280" end="01:10:13.680" style="s2">and pathless right but it&#39;s also bound</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.760" end="01:10:15.090" style="s2">up in insight mm-hmm right and like we</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.680" end="01:10:18.030" style="s2">talked about this last time about the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.090" end="01:10:20.400" style="s2">machinery and the attentional machinery</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.030" end="01:10:21.840" style="s2">of beauty is also the same machinery</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.400" end="01:10:24.150" style="s2">especially if there&#39;s been criticality</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.840" end="01:10:26.670" style="s2">in it right you have to break out of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.150" end="01:10:29.700" style="s2">frame right that that being struck by</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.670" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">beauty there&#39;s an insight and and so if</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.700" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">we if we get</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:35.430" style="s2">training of attention and the affording</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:37.530" style="s2">of insight these are integral to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.430" end="01:10:39.690" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom they&#39;re integral</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.530" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">to the cultivation of wisdom that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.690" end="01:10:43.950" style="s2">mean that&#39;s why you know that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:45.989" style="s2">meditative practices have been</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.950" end="01:10:47.969" style="s2">associated with the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.989" end="01:10:49.560" style="s2">wisdom yeah it&#39;s precisely what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.969" end="01:10:55.890" style="s2">doing is training attention and</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.560" end="01:10:58.110" style="s2">affording insight yeah yeah yeah yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.890" end="01:11:01.950" style="s2">allows you to spew tea somehow the onset</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.110" end="01:11:06.450" style="s2">of beauty allows you to recast you to</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.950" end="01:11:08.550" style="s2">recast your your recast the mode the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.450" end="01:11:11.250" style="s2">fort recast reform of life forecast your</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.550" end="01:11:12.830" style="s2">mode of being in relation mm-hmm I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.250" end="01:11:16.920" style="s2">if we think of it as a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.830" end="01:11:19.680" style="s2">relational dynamic then it can reach can</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.920" end="01:11:21.540" style="s2">refigure the way in which that is framed</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.680" end="01:11:23.820" style="s2">for you at any given moment you must</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.540" end="01:11:29.370" style="s2">change your life you must change your</p>

<p begin="01:11:29.370" end="01:11:36.030" style="s2">it tells us you know very directly that</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.400" end="01:11:39.390" style="s2">you know something some radical shift is</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.030" end="01:11:42.020" style="s2">necessary that&#39;s true virtue is the</p>

<p begin="01:11:58.710" end="01:12:02.610" style="s2">what I propose to you what beauty is and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.020" end="01:12:05.370" style="s2">I think insofar as we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.610" end="01:12:07.350" style="s2">the Sophia of wisdom and the furnaces of</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.370" end="01:12:09.930" style="s2">wisdom that&#39;s virtue and that&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.350" end="01:12:14.070" style="s2">of beauty verge she was a regulation of</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.930" end="01:12:18.060" style="s2">beauty hmm I get struck by beauty in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.070" end="01:12:19.890" style="s2">sense yeah and then the virtue is is how</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.060" end="01:12:22.380" style="s2">you navigate that pathos how do you</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.890" end="01:12:25.080" style="s2">navigate that I would say so I would say</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.380" end="01:12:27.719" style="s2">that that thing that is that that can</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.080" end="01:12:29.910" style="s2">bring out all the you know the demons in</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.719" end="01:12:36.000" style="s2">you and and and also bring out your most</p>

<p begin="01:12:36.000" end="01:12:41.520" style="s2">it can do both I think so and this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.030" end="01:12:44.370" style="s2">what Plato I mean so right philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.520" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">are is the virtue</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.370" end="01:12:48.450" style="s2">of what it&#39;s the appropriate virtue to</p>

<p begin="01:12:48.450" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">just like reverence Woodruff argues is</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.700" end="01:12:58.230" style="s2">the appropriate virtue for the you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:13:00.990" style="s2">for the experience of aw hmm but is but</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.230" end="01:13:02.610" style="s2">as philosophy uh is philosophy em what</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.990" end="01:13:05.220" style="s2">among the virtues Jean or is it the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.610" end="01:13:06.600" style="s2">harmony of the virtues themselves well</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.220" end="01:13:08.250" style="s2">and I think of philosophy a-- and a</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.600" end="01:13:11.940" style="s2">higher order sense i think of it as the</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.250" end="01:13:15.990" style="s2">orchestration of the virtues oh it is i</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.940" end="01:13:18.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s its but but philosophy of</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.990" end="01:13:21.090" style="s2">begins in wonder wonder has a special</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.600" end="01:13:23.310" style="s2">role for philosophy Oh tonic vision</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.090" end="01:13:24.660" style="s2">because wonder is exactly the moment of</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.310" end="01:13:27.480" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been talking about its the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.660" end="01:13:29.820" style="s2">moment of so if we compare if we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.480" end="01:13:31.530" style="s2">very if we contrast wonder to curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.820" end="01:13:33.390" style="s2">where curiosity is there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.530" end="01:13:35.700" style="s2">missing and I want to have it you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.390" end="01:13:37.890" style="s2">which is good but where wonder is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.700" end="01:13:40.530" style="s2">willing to call myself in my world into</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.890" end="01:13:42.570" style="s2">question there can be no pursuit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.530" end="01:13:44.070" style="s2">it&#39;s a wonder has I think in a special</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.570" end="01:13:46.650" style="s2">role I think you&#39;re right philosophy is</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.070" end="01:13:49.560" style="s2">about all of the virtues but to use your</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.650" end="01:13:51.750" style="s2">term I think wonder is the entree it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.560" end="01:13:53.610" style="s2">the right right philosophy of first of</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.750" end="01:13:55.500" style="s2">all is the virtue of appropriately</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.610" end="01:13:58.170" style="s2">wondering because if we can&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.500" end="01:13:59.730" style="s2">ourself and our world into question none</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.150" end="01:14:12.590" style="s2">but in the Buddhist tradition you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.200" end="01:14:16.080" style="s2">sutrayana which is about renunciation</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.590" end="01:14:20.310" style="s2">it&#39;s about training in moral virtue and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.080" end="01:14:22.680" style="s2">it&#39;s about you know it&#39;s about taming</p>

<p begin="01:14:22.680" end="01:14:29.430" style="s2">desires and and becoming becoming wise</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.400" end="01:14:32.160" style="s2">and compassionate in the world and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.430" end="01:14:37.170" style="s2">the next level tantrayana you step into</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.160" end="01:14:39.480" style="s2">another kind of world which which isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:14:42.180" end="01:14:52.650" style="s2">like you&#39;re hit directly by the by the</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.430" end="01:14:56.520" style="s2">energies and so so those two things so</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.650" end="01:14:58.290" style="s2">and of course once you enter tone triana</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.520" end="01:15:00.900" style="s2">you also have to to</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.290" end="01:15:02.550" style="s2">to have embodied suit Rihanna like you</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.900" end="01:15:04.860" style="s2">have to become a morally virtuous person</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.550" end="01:15:08.090" style="s2">before you can you can you can wrestle</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.860" end="01:15:10.740" style="s2">with those those more direct energies</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.090" end="01:15:16.230" style="s2">it&#39;s deeply analogous to the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.740" end="01:15:18.510" style="s2">ascent right so the the Latinas has you</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.230" end="01:15:20.580" style="s2">nobody calls the civic virtues which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.510" end="01:15:23.310" style="s2">the virtues and you know this is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.580" end="01:15:25.200" style="s2">virtue of being you know living with</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.310" end="01:15:27.300" style="s2">others what we normally call the moral</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.200" end="01:15:30.120" style="s2">virtues but they&#39;re much more like we</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.300" end="01:15:33.080" style="s2">said here the understanding that this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.120" end="01:15:35.430" style="s2">that the even the moral virtues are not</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.080" end="01:15:37.650" style="s2">purely individual projects they have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.430" end="01:15:39.750" style="s2">be done in community and in concert with</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.650" end="01:15:42.390" style="s2">other people and then you have what he</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.750" end="01:15:44.130" style="s2">calls you know the cathartic or the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.390" end="01:15:46.770" style="s2">purging virtues these are the virtues</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.130" end="01:15:48.750" style="s2">that take you beyond moral virtue</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.770" end="01:15:53.400" style="s2">because now what you&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.750" end="01:15:55.440" style="s2">not you&#39;re not trying to be honest or be</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.400" end="01:15:57.210" style="s2">good you&#39;re trying to see that about</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.440" end="01:16:00.150" style="s2">which the depths of you and the depths</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.210" end="01:16:02.610" style="s2">of a reality afford this there&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.150" end="01:16:05.310" style="s2">a trans moral sense of goodness and this</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.610" end="01:16:07.680" style="s2">is what takes you to also you can always</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.310" end="01:16:10.680" style="s2">thinking rational trans rational yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.680" end="01:16:13.440" style="s2">exactly exactly that&#39;s exactly what it</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.680" end="01:16:16.530" style="s2">is input - that&#39;s exactly what it is you</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.440" end="01:16:18.390" style="s2">take you take the you take rational or</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.530" end="01:16:20.430" style="s2">what we could call here argumentation as</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.390" end="01:16:22.890" style="s2">far as it goes and what it&#39;s done is</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.430" end="01:16:25.050" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a scaffold that brings</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.890" end="01:16:27.830" style="s2">you up to a place where you can now see</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.050" end="01:16:30.450" style="s2">and be opened up that you can so I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.830" end="01:16:31.830" style="s2">of it like building a structure have you</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.450" end="01:16:34.020" style="s2">ever been in one of the pyramids in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.830" end="01:16:35.280" style="s2">Mayan jungles you climb up the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.020" end="01:16:37.650" style="s2">and the point of the structure is to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.280" end="01:16:39.120" style="s2">to a place where you you you are struck</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.650" end="01:16:41.190" style="s2">in a way you can&#39;t be struck when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.120" end="01:16:44.960" style="s2">in the forest and you&#39;re open to calling</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.190" end="01:16:46.740" style="s2">yourself in your world into question mmm</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.960" end="01:16:49.530" style="s2">argumentation is the building of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.740" end="01:16:52.440" style="s2">pyramid but when you can then be open to</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.530" end="01:16:53.910" style="s2">the sky and to the forest below you and</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.440" end="01:16:56.160" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to call everything now</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.910" end="01:16:59.010" style="s2">into question that is that is that</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.160" end="01:17:01.380" style="s2">moving from you logic propositional sort</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.010" end="01:17:04.800" style="s2">of understanding of things to a more</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.380" end="01:17:06.900" style="s2">spontaneous and let&#39;s say dynamic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.800" end="01:17:09.230" style="s2">moving and doing of things respectable</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.900" end="01:17:11.210" style="s2">and participatory art is it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.230" end="01:17:14.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like the teleological suspension of</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.210" end="01:17:17.870" style="s2">the ethical perfect although I think it</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.120" end="01:17:23.060" style="s2">moves more into beauty does it does it</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.870" end="01:17:26.120" style="s2">does beauty becomes more more beauty and</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.060" end="01:17:27.860" style="s2">play you become become more important</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.120" end="01:17:29.990" style="s2">where in the beginning you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.860" end="01:17:31.790" style="s2">slugging away and trying to understand</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.990" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got your machete and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.790" end="01:17:34.610" style="s2">cutting your way through the jungle and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:36.560" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.610" end="01:17:38.810" style="s2">but the thing you have to remember is is</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:42.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a I mean for and this goes back</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.810" end="01:17:45.890" style="s2">to back to the stuff we were saying</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.410" end="01:17:47.720" style="s2">earlier about how beauty you know how it</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.890" end="01:17:48.980" style="s2">kills you in resurrection like you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.720" end="01:17:50.720" style="s2">you could you&#39;re never gonna become a</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.980" end="01:17:53.810" style="s2">God in Plato at most you&#39;re always gonna</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.720" end="01:17:55.310" style="s2">be godlike and and and you come out of</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.810" end="01:17:57.200" style="s2">the clave and see the Sun but you were</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.310" end="01:18:00.290" style="s2">turning back into the cave so the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.200" end="01:18:02.360" style="s2">moments in my practice where I touch the</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.290" end="01:18:05.360" style="s2">one or the Sun or the ground of being</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.360" end="01:18:08.090" style="s2">they then feed back into when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.360" end="01:18:10.040" style="s2">the right the propositional or very sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.090" end="01:18:11.990" style="s2">of thing right no yeah and of course I</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.040" end="01:18:14.120" style="s2">think of that then you know the comes</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.990" end="01:18:15.050" style="s2">back to the marketplace with yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.120" end="01:18:17.690" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.050" end="01:18:21.140" style="s2">you know what&#39;s called I forget that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.690" end="01:18:23.690" style="s2">know there&#39;s in you know the the Zen</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.140" end="01:18:26.120" style="s2">parables were where he you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.690" end="01:18:29.510" style="s2">he&#39;s chasing the the bull and then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.120" end="01:18:32.060" style="s2">looking for he&#39;s riding the Ox and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.510" end="01:18:33.590" style="s2">and then and then there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.060" end="01:18:37.850" style="s2">there&#39;s emptiness and then he comes back</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.590" end="01:18:40.970" style="s2">with with gifts yeah exactly so you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.850" end="01:18:44.810" style="s2">so you know those moments those moments</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.970" end="01:18:47.030" style="s2">of trans rational they they shine into</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.810" end="01:18:49.160" style="s2">they in power they install they in live</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.030" end="01:18:51.080" style="s2">and they beautify the rational moments</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.160" end="01:18:53.150" style="s2">and then the rational moments have</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.080" end="01:18:55.400" style="s2">appropriate reverence to what is</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.150" end="01:18:58.790" style="s2">disclosed in the trans rational moments</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.400" end="01:19:00.980" style="s2">okay that&#39;s nice mmm-hmm although I</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.790" end="01:19:03.260" style="s2">guess I guess for someone like Allard</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.980" end="01:19:08.780" style="s2">that the entire process we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.260" end="01:19:11.330" style="s2">described is rationality per se well</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.780" end="01:19:13.670" style="s2">yeah the aspiration to rationality and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.330" end="01:19:17.930" style="s2">the aspiration to trans rationality is</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.670" end="01:19:20.990" style="s2">itself proleptic rationality and yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.930" end="01:19:22.390" style="s2">far as we&#39;re aspiring to any even beat</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.990" end="01:19:24.340" style="s2">not even just a virtue but</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.390" end="01:19:28.180" style="s2">- Andrew said - something that is beyond</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.340" end="01:19:29.590" style="s2">virtue right the good beyond moral</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.180" end="01:19:33.040" style="s2">goodness</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.590" end="01:19:37.170" style="s2">I think we&#39;re engaged in in in some kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.040" end="01:19:39.640" style="s2">of proleptic process yes for sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.170" end="01:19:41.770" style="s2">generally we were engaged in aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.640" end="01:19:44.200" style="s2">and the other thing I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.770" end="01:19:46.510" style="s2">is how normally think of beauty as</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.200" end="01:19:48.850" style="s2">something very high high up there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.510" end="01:19:51.220" style="s2">very sublime and we&#39;re very very up here</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.850" end="01:19:53.590" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.220" end="01:19:55.870" style="s2">high culture and and you know all that</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.590" end="01:19:58.000" style="s2">sort of stuff but it&#39;s also you can find</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.870" end="01:20:00.190" style="s2">beauty in a rap song you can find beauty</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.000" end="01:20:03.070" style="s2">everywhere like easily and the lowest</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.190" end="01:20:06.820" style="s2">you know and in the most you know banal</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.070" end="01:20:09.610" style="s2">things it&#39;s it&#39;s not something that is</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.820" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">necessarily hierarchical or isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.610" end="01:20:14.680" style="s2">the same for virtue mmm we find virtue</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.880" end="01:20:16.660" style="s2">in our highest ideals but if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.680" end="01:20:23.200" style="s2">useless if you can&#39;t find it in my new</p>

<p begin="01:20:25.750" end="01:20:31.450" style="s2">in the way that the well not by analogy</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.860" end="01:20:34.570" style="s2">by identity the way the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.450" end="01:20:36.990" style="s2">hypostasis are dispersed ontologically</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.570" end="01:20:40.300" style="s2">dispersed without somehow being</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.990" end="01:20:42.700" style="s2">diminished yeah right yeah the Sun</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.300" end="01:20:44.650" style="s2">shines but it doesn&#39;t but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.700" end="01:20:46.750" style="s2">diminished by it&#39;s shining yeah even</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.650" end="01:20:48.940" style="s2">though he says that&#39;s not true but I get</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.750" end="01:20:51.670" style="s2">I get but I get platonist as metaphor at</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.940" end="01:20:57.880" style="s2">least in exhaustion who cares about the</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.670" end="01:21:01.060" style="s2">physics the one overflows or or or or</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.880" end="01:21:02.410" style="s2">like the top HN right the the Dow is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.060" end="01:21:04.780" style="s2">well that you can get you and you can</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.410" end="01:21:08.620" style="s2">just continually draw forth from it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.780" end="01:21:12.520" style="s2">yes mm-hmm yes I should get going soon</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.620" end="01:21:14.590" style="s2">gentlemen and I think we&#39;ve seen me to</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.520" end="01:21:17.440" style="s2">fall into kind of a wonderful convivial</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.590" end="01:21:19.240" style="s2">silence anyways yeah yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.440" end="01:21:21.250" style="s2">silence descending on the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.240" end="01:21:22.750" style="s2">somewhat I agree and it&#39;s a good one</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.250" end="01:21:23.830" style="s2">though it&#39;s a really wonderful one so</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.750" end="01:21:26.700" style="s2">what are we getting we&#39;ve reinvented</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.830" end="01:21:29.020" style="s2">beauty and we&#39;ve reinvented the soul and</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.700" end="01:21:30.850" style="s2">so what are we gonna and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.020" end="01:21:33.130" style="s2">reinvented virtue so what are we going</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.850" end="01:21:34.500" style="s2">to reinvent next well like I said I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.130" end="01:21:36.210" style="s2">been trying to reinvent</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.500" end="01:21:37.170" style="s2">rationality and night-night today I was</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.210" end="01:21:38.790" style="s2">trying to bring them together with</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.170" end="01:21:40.950" style="s2">reinventing argumentation within</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.790" end="01:21:43.080" style="s2">dialectic I just want to keep going</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.950" end="01:21:45.180" style="s2">because great synthesis John</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.080" end="01:21:46.890" style="s2">incidentally like there was a fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.180" end="01:21:49.230" style="s2">theoretical synthesis that you opened</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.890" end="01:21:50.880" style="s2">with very very well thank you for that I</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.230" end="01:21:53.820" style="s2">mean I&#39;m trying like I said I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.880" end="01:21:55.740" style="s2">to get what would die illogical</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.820" end="01:21:57.660" style="s2">argumentation look like rather than</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.740" end="01:21:59.790" style="s2">monological argumentation and I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.660" end="01:22:02.400" style="s2">to get more the sense of logos as</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.790" end="01:22:03.990" style="s2">drawing together the affording insight</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.400" end="01:22:06.330" style="s2">that moves you to the next proposal the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.990" end="01:22:09.630" style="s2">draws together like it&#39;s different than</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.330" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">just premise premise premise but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.630" end="01:22:14.160" style="s2">embodied in feeling isn&#39;t it it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.000" end="01:22:18.710" style="s2">it&#39;s broadened into the the entire realm</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.160" end="01:22:22.440" style="s2">of feeling in an body rather than just</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.710" end="01:22:24.450" style="s2">upstairs very much very much it goes</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.440" end="01:22:26.760" style="s2">back to your metropolis thing we try to</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.450" end="01:22:27.780" style="s2">link hand and heart and head together</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.760" end="01:22:31.530" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.780" end="01:22:34.680" style="s2">in this sense of argumentation and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.530" end="01:22:38.970" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to in soul and and heartening</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.680" end="01:22:41.430" style="s2">and and you know make make beautiful all</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.970" end="01:22:43.140" style="s2">of these things because notice that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.430" end="01:22:44.640" style="s2">were willing I mean we came in good</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.140" end="01:22:47.370" style="s2">faith and we were willing to probe and</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.640" end="01:22:49.470" style="s2">push and move and challenge but all that</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.370" end="01:22:52.740" style="s2">did was afford right it just afforded</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.470" end="01:22:56.640" style="s2">more and more and more and that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.740" end="01:22:58.560" style="s2">III and like I&#39;m I&#39;m working my way</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.640" end="01:23:00.390" style="s2">towards this I I&#39;m not complained I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.560" end="01:23:03.150" style="s2">not claiming anything complete hearing</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.390" end="01:23:13.500" style="s2">but trying to get what this would look</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.150" end="01:23:15.660" style="s2">like for us yeah well it&#39;s it&#39;s I also</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.500" end="01:23:17.850" style="s2">want say Andrew that it&#39;s very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.660" end="01:23:19.680" style="s2">because John and I John and I do this</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.850" end="01:23:21.150" style="s2">all the time and because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.680" end="01:23:23.550" style="s2">certain shorthand and there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.150" end="01:23:26.160" style="s2">shared vocabulary yeah one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.550" end="01:23:28.590" style="s2">you introduced that we don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.160" end="01:23:30.360" style="s2">as much on our own is you introduce the</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.590" end="01:23:34.230" style="s2">kind of more the more sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.360" end="01:23:36.270" style="s2">interrogative challenge that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.230" end="01:23:38.190" style="s2">very helpful which it diminishes it</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.270" end="01:23:40.620" style="s2">diminishes a little bit because once you</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.190" end="01:23:42.120" style="s2">become very very very fluent and how</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.620" end="01:23:45.120" style="s2">conversant you are with another person</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.120" end="01:23:46.440" style="s2">once this is such a shared once there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.120" end="01:23:48.390" style="s2">there&#39;s so much of a shared vocabulary</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.440" end="01:23:50.340" style="s2">that things become</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.390" end="01:23:52.590" style="s2">you you you don&#39;t realize how like when</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.340" end="01:23:54.300" style="s2">up won&#39;t clairvoyance or so engine</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.590" end="01:23:56.520" style="s2">yeah when John I speak just the two of</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.300" end="01:23:59.070" style="s2">us there&#39;s we&#39;re standing on so many</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.520" end="01:24:00.930" style="s2">unspoken presumptions and so many sort</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.070" end="01:24:03.120" style="s2">of shared axioms that a lot goes</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.930" end="01:24:05.850" style="s2">unchallenged simply because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.120" end="01:24:07.530" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s so much you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.850" end="01:24:09.570" style="s2">so much underfoot that sort of goes</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.530" end="01:24:12.060" style="s2">unacknowledged but one thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.570" end="01:24:14.430" style="s2">add to this one of the many things you</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.060" end="01:24:18.240" style="s2">add to this is that you challenge some</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.430" end="01:24:20.750" style="s2">of those some of those presumptions used</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.240" end="01:24:24.720" style="s2">to challenge some of those sort of those</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.750" end="01:24:26.730" style="s2">those unspoken premises that were</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.720" end="01:24:28.290" style="s2">standing on without realizing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.730" end="01:24:30.270" style="s2">standing on them whether they be having</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.290" end="01:24:32.160" style="s2">to do with vocabulary or having to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.270" end="01:24:35.070" style="s2">with the use of certain terms etc and</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.160" end="01:24:36.870" style="s2">that&#39;s very very helpful to in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.070" end="01:24:39.000" style="s2">proper sense of the term to humiliate</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.870" end="01:24:41.220" style="s2">the conversation and we&#39;re all it into</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.000" end="01:24:44.570" style="s2">proper question and you I think you</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.220" end="01:24:47.250" style="s2">bring that beautifully and very and very</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.570" end="01:24:49.530" style="s2">definitely and I think you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.250" end="01:24:52.590" style="s2">really teaching me something here about</p>

<p begin="01:24:52.590" end="01:24:58.440" style="s2">right moment to interject and I do feel</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.070" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">like I&#39;m stumbling around a lot of the</p>

<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:06.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a harmony coming into these</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.850" end="01:25:09.410" style="s2">conversations that that that you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.090" end="01:25:13.080" style="s2">each time that that&#39;s a little bit and</p>
