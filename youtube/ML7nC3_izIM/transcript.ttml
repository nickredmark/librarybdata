<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.740" style="s2">hey everyone so this is a reupload of</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.100" end="00:00:06.629" style="s2">the London real update with coffee Zilla</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.740" end="00:00:08.460" style="s2">which was put up a while ago and was</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.629" end="00:00:11.130" style="s2">just taken down because of a copyright</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.460" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">claim from London real for that back</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.130" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">story watch the film that&#39;s going out at</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:18.270" style="s2">the same time as this it&#39;s a short</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:20.850" style="s2">update and explains how London really</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.270" end="00:00:23.670" style="s2">using copyright law pretty cynically to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.850" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">avoid scrutiny but I&#39;ve taken out all of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.670" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">the copyright material from this so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:29.490" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t get flagged again so that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">will go up and will give a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.490" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">back story we&#39;ve also put the original</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">investigation on our website via bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">shoot so if you want to see that go to</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:43.829" style="s2">the website so I hope this is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">the last film about the London real</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.829" end="00:00:47.879" style="s2">situation I&#39;d much prefer be making</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">films about the wider issues raised by</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">it kind of free speech censorship but it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">is such a good story and I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s worth rounding it off and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">the best way to do that would be to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.840" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">a dialogue with coffee Zilla so coffee</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">Zilla is an American youtuber who&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">been following the story so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">play the whole conversation and in it we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">talked about the recent meltdown on</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">YouTube and how the London real army</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">seems to be turning against Brian Rose I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:19.409" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine a bigger trainwreck with</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:20.610" style="s2">your audience because basically he was</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.409" end="00:01:22.140" style="s2">getting all these questions all this</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.610" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">pressure and it&#39;s like one day he just</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.140" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">snapped he&#39;s cursing at his audience</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">calling them fools it was insane it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">absolutely insane I&#39;ve never seen a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">meltdown quite like this and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">waiting for it to be deleted and it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">up for at least 24 hours and just to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">clear it was deleted eventually yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">also the central question of whether the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">entire fundraising scheme makes any</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.570" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">sense at all it&#39;s the it&#39;s the funniest</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">thing in the world to me because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.229" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">makes zero sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">as soon as Brian rose said that I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">like okay your whole thing makes zero</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">since you&#39;ve raised all this money for</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">nothing other than yourself and your own</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">ego about having your own platform so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna record an update to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">London real investigation London real</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">situation I&#39;m joined by coffee Zilla</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">who&#39;s been doing his own follow ups on</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">the London real situation Thank You</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">travelling coffee Zilla Steven Steven</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:17.220" style="s2">I&#39;ll say Steven from now on</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:19.410" style="s2">and so I think both of us we&#39;ve talked a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.220" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">little bit offline before recording this</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.410" end="00:02:23.220" style="s2">and I think both of us feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">torn like we don&#39;t want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.220" end="00:02:27.030" style="s2">returning to this story but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:28.860" style="s2">such a great story I&#39;d spend a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.030" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">time just kind of unpacking some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.860" end="00:02:34.709" style="s2">the wider issues what we&#39;ve we&#39;ve both</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">been contacted by other people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.709" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">got knowledge of the situation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:39.030" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of stuff that&#39;s been going</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:41.610" style="s2">on I think it&#39;s worth unpacking and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.030" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">revealing to people and also just some</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.610" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">of the it&#39;s it&#39;s an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:49.170" style="s2">compelling story just to see it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:51.299" style="s2">unfolding in real time just before we</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.170" end="00:02:52.799" style="s2">kind of get into the details of it where</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.299" end="00:02:55.319" style="s2">are you at with it at the moment I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.799" end="00:02:57.420" style="s2">where you are I&#39;m sort of tired of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.319" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">piece but also I can&#39;t stop looking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.420" end="00:03:00.540" style="s2">almost like a horrible car crash or</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.540" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">full disclosure I&#39;ve what I was watching</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:06.180" style="s2">landed real before this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">happened and I saw his content it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.180" end="00:03:10.230" style="s2">going in a certain direction and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:12.090" style="s2">like I felt and a lot of people felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.230" end="00:03:15.150" style="s2">that recently he has completely shifted</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.090" end="00:03:17.069" style="s2">into a new direction and there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:19.049" style="s2">of questions about you know this</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.069" end="00:03:21.930" style="s2">fundraising he&#39;s been doing how</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.049" end="00:03:24.359" style="s2">transparent he&#39;s been and yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.930" end="00:03:27.420" style="s2">like at this point I&#39;m so far in that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.359" end="00:03:29.819" style="s2">I have to at least wrap the bow tie the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.420" end="00:03:32.730" style="s2">bow whatever before letting this thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.819" end="00:03:35.609" style="s2">go finally yeah I feel similarly</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.730" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying I mean I was primarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.609" end="00:03:40.079" style="s2">interested in it for the wider issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">that it put put out there free speech</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.079" end="00:03:45.870" style="s2">censorship but the weaponization of free</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.410" end="00:03:48.299" style="s2">speech is just a huge in huge thing as</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.870" end="00:03:50.130" style="s2">well like playing the censorship cloud</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.299" end="00:03:52.950" style="s2">playing the free speech card and for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.130" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">I feel that those are such powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.950" end="00:03:57.720" style="s2">cards and such important cards that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to be kind of very aware and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.720" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">very careful about kind of how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:03.359" style="s2">used and how that can be abused and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">think just to bring people up to date</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.359" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">there has been something of a backlash</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">which we&#39;ll get to soon like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">audience his own audience people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:12.810" style="s2">donated money especially have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">been asking some pretty tough questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.810" end="00:04:17.099" style="s2">and also there&#39;s another angle that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:19.169" style="s2">you&#39;re much more familiar with than I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.099" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">which is other sort of business</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.169" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">practices he&#39;s brought in this five</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:28.200" style="s2">coins to five million with with tikka</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">tikka khari tikka Tiwari tickety</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.200" end="00:04:33.810" style="s2">to worry tiga Tiwari and another another</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:35.670" style="s2">business guy and you&#39;ve you&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.810" end="00:04:36.900" style="s2">focused really carefully on that in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.670" end="00:04:39.870" style="s2">lot of the other films that you&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.900" end="00:04:42.780" style="s2">out yeah I think it&#39;s like a it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.870" end="00:04:45.750" style="s2">massive question a massive problem when</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.780" end="00:04:47.850" style="s2">you have someone you know raising</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.750" end="00:04:49.230" style="s2">raising all these funds for in the name</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.850" end="00:04:50.910" style="s2">of freedom but also collecting all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.230" end="00:04:52.980" style="s2">emails also getting all this attention</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.910" end="00:04:55.230" style="s2">and saying like I&#39;m the guy that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.980" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">guys can trust to give you the truth but</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.230" end="00:05:00.510" style="s2">then you&#39;re selling some crypto what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:02.520" style="s2">characterize as a scam and that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.510" end="00:05:03.330" style="s2">all of a sudden a problem I I think what</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.520" end="00:05:05.190" style="s2">you said is true</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.330" end="00:05:08.190" style="s2">weaponizing freedom of speech because</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.190" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">it&#39;s such a powerful motivator it&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.190" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">course a universal human value so when</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:13.470" style="s2">you hear hey I&#39;m the freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:15.420" style="s2">guy who&#39;s gonna say no to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.470" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">right like everybody&#39;s a freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.420" end="00:05:22.170" style="s2">speech guy almost so so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:23.370" style="s2">important to say that look I don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:26.070" style="s2">with YouTube&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.370" end="00:05:28.350" style="s2">you know censorship here I said that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.070" end="00:05:30.210" style="s2">from day one of even about David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:31.830" style="s2">day one I said you know what I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.830" end="00:05:35.760" style="s2">think there needs to be a broader</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.850" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">discussion but what&#39;s happened is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.760" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">weaponized that and turned it into let</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:44.340" style="s2">speech and that&#39;s just simply not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.570" end="00:05:48.180" style="s2">truth I think this is a sacred value and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.340" end="00:05:51.780" style="s2">it really yeah I feel I feel very</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" end="00:05:54.210" style="s2">energized by when when that is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.780" end="00:05:56.250" style="s2">weaponized and then it gets caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.210" end="00:05:57.930" style="s2">like we&#39;re in we&#39;re in a struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.250" end="00:05:58.920" style="s2">the tech platforms a lot of us feel like</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.930" end="00:06:00.230" style="s2">we&#39;re in a struggle with the tech</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.920" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">platforms we&#39;re worried about being</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.230" end="00:06:03.990" style="s2">demonetized were worrying about worrying</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:06.930" style="s2">about we&#39;re worried about having some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.990" end="00:06:09.900" style="s2">our stuff taken down so I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.930" end="00:06:11.300" style="s2">got a basically clean house we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.900" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">kind of call out the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.300" end="00:06:15.830" style="s2">using those really powerful arguments</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:18.690" style="s2">for their own benefits</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.830" end="00:06:20.220" style="s2">yeah for sure I think the question here</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.690" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">is what&#39;s the intention behind the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.220" end="00:06:23.610" style="s2">digital freedom platform I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:25.500" style="s2">a large question I mean whether he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.610" end="00:06:27.660" style="s2">spending the money poorly or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.500" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">what are Brian roses intentions because</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.660" end="00:06:31.470" style="s2">for a long time he&#39;s been saying oh I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:33.510" style="s2">just care about free speech I just care</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.470" end="00:06:36.270" style="s2">about this I&#39;m being silenced bubbeleh</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.510" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">one thing I brought sort of to light</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.270" end="00:06:39.720" style="s2">though in one of my recent videos is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:41.370" style="s2">that Brian Rose&#39;s channel has never been</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.720" end="00:06:41.969" style="s2">doing better he has seized an</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.370" end="00:06:43.679" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.969" end="00:06:45.389" style="s2">and his views went like this he was like</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.679" end="00:06:46.229" style="s2">kind of stagnant and then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.389" end="00:06:48.269" style="s2">sudden he starts talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.229" end="00:06:50.519" style="s2">censorship he&#39;s like this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.269" end="00:06:53.429" style="s2">use in terms of subscribers in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.519" end="00:06:55.709" style="s2">people backing him in terms of donations</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.429" end="00:06:58.139" style="s2">in terms of people for his email list in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.709" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">terms of his own audience pool within</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.139" end="00:07:01.860" style="s2">his audience that was already there all</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:03.869" style="s2">of a sudden they care a lot more and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.860" end="00:07:06.509" style="s2">you have to wonder with each thing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.869" end="00:07:08.610" style="s2">doing is he doing it because he wants</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.509" end="00:07:10.619" style="s2">freedom of speech or is he capitalizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.610" end="00:07:15.229" style="s2">on what could be characterized as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.619" end="00:07:17.939" style="s2">extremely lucrative situation yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.229" end="00:07:20.489" style="s2">let&#39;s recap I mentioned a few things in</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.939" end="00:07:24.119" style="s2">that little spiel before one of which</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.489" end="00:07:25.499" style="s2">was the the fact that he supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.119" end="00:07:26.999" style="s2">raised a million it&#39;s hard to know</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.499" end="00:07:29.549" style="s2">because the the counter was actually on</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.999" end="00:07:31.169" style="s2">the London real site I was skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.549" end="00:07:33.209" style="s2">that he actually had but you you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.169" end="00:07:35.279" style="s2">that he may well have done which I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.209" end="00:07:36.959" style="s2">is worth unpacking in itself but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.279" end="00:07:40.259" style="s2">what happened next cuz then there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.959" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">this stage six or phase six money-making</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.259" end="00:07:43.259" style="s2">thing which was we need two hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:45.529" style="s2">fifty thousand a month to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.259" end="00:07:47.879" style="s2">thing running yeah I think it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.529" end="00:07:50.069" style="s2">going back a little bit because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.879" end="00:07:52.409" style="s2">happened so that now if you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.069" end="00:07:53.939" style="s2">present for each subsequent stage you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.409" end="00:07:56.159" style="s2">could think oh it was always planned out</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.939" end="00:07:58.529" style="s2">to be for six phases and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.159" end="00:08:00.509" style="s2">my biggest criticisms of London real so</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.529" end="00:08:02.939" style="s2">it started with phase one oh I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.509" end="00:08:04.469" style="s2">livestream a million people then right</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.939" end="00:08:06.209" style="s2">after he reaches his goal all of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.469" end="00:08:07.469" style="s2">sudden he introduces phase two and three</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.209" end="00:08:10.169" style="s2">he didn&#39;t even have four or five and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.469" end="00:08:12.539" style="s2">four five and six yet that&#39;s all came on</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.169" end="00:08:15.059" style="s2">later so then he goes okay all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.539" end="00:08:16.709" style="s2">raising for is now more controversial</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.059" end="00:08:18.449" style="s2">voices and blockchain where he got</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.709" end="00:08:19.649" style="s2">blockchain from nobody knows cuz nobody</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.449" end="00:08:22.139" style="s2">really understands why it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.649" end="00:08:24.449" style="s2">it&#39;s not so then he raises that money</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.139" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">then he goes okay well now I need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.449" end="00:08:29.129" style="s2">raise more money and the the logic there</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:31.409" style="s2">was that okay David give me money</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.129" end="00:08:32.729" style="s2">because really the intention is just to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.409" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">fundraise to the end of our fundraising</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.729" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">date and then I&#39;m shutting it off the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">only you know rationale for putting more</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:39.899" style="s2">and more stretch goals was always well</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:42.539" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna continue fundraising</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.899" end="00:08:44.129" style="s2">continue taking your money until we go</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.539" end="00:08:45.569" style="s2">to the fundraising date that was always</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.129" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">the plan that was the whole rationale</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.569" end="00:08:49.230" style="s2">for creating nine hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:51.089" style="s2">dollars in stretch goals and then all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.230" end="00:08:52.470" style="s2">a sudden the fundraising ends he raised</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.089" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">his over million dollars I believe he</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.470" end="00:08:55.410" style="s2">did I believe he did and I&#39;ll explain</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">that in a second but</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.410" end="00:08:59.430" style="s2">then he all of a sudden moves on without</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:00.360" style="s2">missing a beat without any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.430" end="00:09:02.759" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.360" end="00:09:05.370" style="s2">it&#39;s okay well now we need running costs</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.759" end="00:09:07.199" style="s2">and he hikes up the price to another</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.370" end="00:09:08.819" style="s2">three million dollars over the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.199" end="00:09:10.350" style="s2">year but why I think he actually raised</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.819" end="00:09:13.350" style="s2">the money because it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.350" end="00:09:15.089" style="s2">for him to put I think the donation</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:17.009" style="s2">fatigue that it creates in your audience</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.089" end="00:09:20.009" style="s2">when you if you lied about raising a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.009" end="00:09:21.959" style="s2">million dollars is not worth the press</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.009" end="00:09:23.579" style="s2">of raising a million dollars like who</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.959" end="00:09:25.259" style="s2">wants to rate who wants to donate to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.579" end="00:09:28.050" style="s2">guy who&#39;s already has a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.259" end="00:09:30.689" style="s2">like nobody so I think of anything if</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.050" end="00:09:33.629" style="s2">you were to lie about a donation you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.689" end="00:09:36.990" style="s2">would probably under under represent it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.629" end="00:09:38.850" style="s2">but I just generally think I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.990" end="00:09:40.410" style="s2">one way or the other I think it just if</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.850" end="00:09:43.310" style="s2">we just think in terms of rational</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.410" end="00:09:47.370" style="s2">actors he probably didn&#39;t lie about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.310" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">yeah I mean I think it&#39;s worth digging</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.370" end="00:09:52.350" style="s2">into that because my sense was that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:54.269" style="s2">that he probably didn&#39;t raise a million</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.350" end="00:09:55.740" style="s2">I mean that the count was on his website</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.269" end="00:09:58.290" style="s2">it was hard to verify there was no</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.740" end="00:10:00.689" style="s2">verification but you&#39;ve looked at these</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.290" end="00:10:03.209" style="s2">kind of tactics before and you feel you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.689" end="00:10:04.649" style="s2">think that people have raised that kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.209" end="00:10:06.269" style="s2">of money doing this kind of thing before</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.649" end="00:10:08.430" style="s2">is that would that be a fair summary oh</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.269" end="00:10:10.259" style="s2">yeah if the skepticism is a million</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.430" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">dollars is a lot of money fear not</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.259" end="00:10:15.089" style="s2">because the the tactics that&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:17.370" style="s2">employing here or what I see all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.089" end="00:10:18.810" style="s2">time among fake gurus and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.370" end="00:10:20.939" style="s2">persuasion tactics that I see all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.810" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">time among internet marketers and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.939" end="00:10:24.060" style="s2">London real actually has been leveling</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:26.310" style="s2">up I mean he&#39;s been improving his game</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.060" end="00:10:29.699" style="s2">quite considerably because for a while</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.310" end="00:10:31.290" style="s2">you know he didn&#39;t name his his audience</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.699" end="00:10:32.759" style="s2">all of a sudden with this thing came</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.290" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">along he goes oh you guys are the line</p>

<p begin="00:11:44.339" end="00:11:51.269" style="s2">mean we both saw it on Sunday night so</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.889" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">he initially posted the a community post</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.269" end="00:11:57.389" style="s2">on YouTube saying with a link to the</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.500" end="00:14:04.920" style="s2">to be deleted and it was up for at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.029" end="00:14:07.320" style="s2">24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.920" end="00:14:08.850" style="s2">this guy says David Icke and Brian Rose</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.320" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">are controlled opposition sorry if you</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:16.470" style="s2">controlled idiot sorry if you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.990" end="00:14:20.459" style="s2">it and just to be clear it was deleted</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.470" end="00:14:23.010" style="s2">eventually yeah and I was genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.459" end="00:14:28.440" style="s2">concerned I I was kind of like wow this</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.010" end="00:14:31.860" style="s2">is this is kind of extreme and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.440" end="00:14:35.540" style="s2">yesterday he brought out another very</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.860" end="00:14:37.829" style="s2">sort of slickly produced piece that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:39.149" style="s2">clearly in response to that but he</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.829" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">obviously didn&#39;t mention it he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.149" end="00:14:42.300" style="s2">mention that he&#39;d done anything he</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:44.519" style="s2">didn&#39;t mention any of the argument just</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.300" end="00:14:46.589" style="s2">just sort of I need to be more</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.519" end="00:14:49.140" style="s2">transparent clearly I have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.589" end="00:14:49.560" style="s2">with communicating and I need to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.140" end="00:14:52.170" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.560" end="00:14:54.510" style="s2">I got an unsettled feeling watching that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.170" end="00:14:57.449" style="s2">extremely unsettled because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.510" end="00:15:00.300" style="s2">difference between what he said a day</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.449" end="00:15:03.209" style="s2">ago and what he said the very next day</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.300" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">was so far apart it seemed like I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.209" end="00:15:07.880" style="s2">watching I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d say like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">a chameleon something changing colours</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.880" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">purely based on environmental factors</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:15.660" style="s2">which made it totally unbelievable you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.370" style="s2">know because one second he&#39;s calling his</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">audience idiots and then the next second</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.370" end="00:15:21.630" style="s2">he&#39;s sitting in front of a camera saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:23.190" style="s2">you know what I was bad at communicating</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.630" end="00:15:24.510" style="s2">I want to explain this whole thing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.190" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">you guys I want to be open to criticism</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.510" end="00:15:29.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like wait this is not the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:31.019" style="s2">person we saw just yesterday and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.430" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t address it at all either like he</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.019" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">deleted it</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:34.800" style="s2">he won&#39;t address it he won&#39;t address the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:35.640" style="s2">fact that he was belittling his audience</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.800" end="00:15:38.640" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.640" end="00:15:40.650" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s extremely strange and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.640" end="00:15:43.320" style="s2">like I think Brian just felt trapped and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.650" end="00:15:46.350" style="s2">I think it shows how much he can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.320" end="00:15:47.670" style="s2">put it on you know like one second he</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.350" end="00:15:49.740" style="s2">totally believes he doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.670" end="00:15:51.480" style="s2">explain himself the next second I really</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.740" end="00:15:54.390" style="s2">care about you guys and I really want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.480" end="00:15:56.940" style="s2">do better and edit it out very weird</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.390" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">yeah and I think it&#39;s worth kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.940" end="00:16:00.690" style="s2">flagging up some of the other stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:02.520" style="s2">we there&#39;s kind of happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.690" end="00:16:05.790" style="s2">background as well I mean I&#39;ve been sent</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.520" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">so we know that they delete some</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.790" end="00:16:12.410" style="s2">comments off the YouTube channel they</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:15.390" style="s2">also have their own internal London real</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.410" end="00:16:18.120" style="s2">messaging system that is pre flagging</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.390" end="00:16:20.460" style="s2">certain certain work keywords and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.120" end="00:16:22.200" style="s2">certain topics that you can&#39;t post so</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.460" end="00:16:23.790" style="s2">that includes like someone someone sent</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.200" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">me some screenshots that that includes</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.790" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">dailymotion that includes snake-oil so</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:32.970" style="s2">anyone trying to discuss the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:36.270" style="s2">internally is not allowed to so I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.970" end="00:16:38.700" style="s2">this is worth flagging up which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.270" end="00:16:40.080" style="s2">another thing about sort of yes free</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.700" end="00:16:41.940" style="s2">speech we can talk about anything but</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.080" end="00:16:44.760" style="s2">don&#39;t question me I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.940" end="00:16:47.210" style="s2">really quite astonishing and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.760" end="00:16:50.690" style="s2">another thing that we found out from</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.210" end="00:16:55.050" style="s2">quite a few different places is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.690" end="00:16:56.910" style="s2">there was a big a lot of his staff were</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.050" end="00:16:58.260" style="s2">not happy about him doing the the David</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.260" end="00:17:04.140" style="s2">the right into me to do in the current</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.180" end="00:17:06.120" style="s2">situation they didn&#39;t want they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:07.350" style="s2">think it was responsible they knew what</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.120" end="00:17:10.050" style="s2">David Icke was gonna be saying when he</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.350" end="00:17:12.360" style="s2">came on so a lot of his staff objected</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.050" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">to the David I continue don&#39;t happen</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:20.370" style="s2">that a lot of them were either sacked or</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.089" end="00:17:22.530" style="s2">made redundant quite quite a large</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.370" end="00:17:25.440" style="s2">number of London real staff he went he</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.530" end="00:17:27.390" style="s2">went from sort of what 14 or 15 staff</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.440" end="00:17:29.700" style="s2">down to a very very small number of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.390" end="00:17:31.290" style="s2">staff that was before any of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.700" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">fundraising happened I think something</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.290" end="00:17:35.940" style="s2">worth highlighting here is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:37.530" style="s2">had people coming to us from behind the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.940" end="00:17:39.630" style="s2">scenes we haven&#39;t talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.530" end="00:17:41.700" style="s2">either of our investigations but with</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.630" end="00:17:43.320" style="s2">some knowledge of the London real</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.700" end="00:17:47.600" style="s2">situation we&#39;ve got a much clearer</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.320" end="00:17:49.559" style="s2">picture of what&#39;s going on that do raise</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.600" end="00:17:51.779" style="s2">inconsistencies maybe help</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.559" end="00:17:53.580" style="s2">because why you can make the free speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.779" end="00:17:54.929" style="s2">argument like you said about David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.580" end="00:17:57.149" style="s2">I don&#39;t even think you have to I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.929" end="00:17:59.610" style="s2">you can simply point out the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.149" end="00:18:01.320" style="s2">Brian Rose wants it both ways he wants</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.610" end="00:18:02.759" style="s2">to on the one hand say he&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.320" end="00:18:04.019" style="s2">free speech free speech free speech you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.759" end="00:18:05.399" style="s2">can say whatever you want I fight for</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.019" end="00:18:06.570" style="s2">free speech but on the other hand he</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.399" end="00:18:09.169" style="s2">also wants to censor comments at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.570" end="00:18:11.940" style="s2">critical of him like how can he want</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.169" end="00:18:13.620" style="s2">YouTube to not censor anything of his</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.940" end="00:18:15.389" style="s2">but he wants to censor his audience</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.620" end="00:18:17.759" style="s2">himself he wants a control goes on his</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.389" end="00:18:20.129" style="s2">on his digital freedom platform in his</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.759" end="00:18:22.110" style="s2">own Terms of Service on the platform</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.129" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">that he says is so much for free speech</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.110" end="00:18:28.019" style="s2">it says that long-stem limited at any</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:30.899" style="s2">point can just remove anything they find</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.019" end="00:18:32.759" style="s2">objectionable if that isn&#39;t a community</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.899" end="00:18:34.019" style="s2">guidelines i&#39;ve never heard of one</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.759" end="00:18:36.990" style="s2">before like that it&#39;s just community</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.019" end="00:18:40.139" style="s2">guidelines repurposed for Brian Rose it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.990" end="00:18:42.539" style="s2">it seems like this Brian Rose is unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.139" end="00:18:43.980" style="s2">with YouTube calling the shots and so he</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.539" end="00:18:47.249" style="s2">wanted to make a platform where he</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.980" end="00:18:48.570" style="s2">called the shots but that doesn&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.249" end="00:18:50.519" style="s2">lot of press who&#39;s gonna build Brian</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.570" end="00:18:52.049" style="s2">Rose his own platform well if all of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.519" end="00:18:54.570" style="s2">sudden you call it the digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.049" end="00:18:56.999" style="s2">platform you get a lot more traction and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.570" end="00:18:58.830" style="s2">to speak about this as this skeleton</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.999" end="00:19:00.899" style="s2">crew of employees for a second I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.830" end="00:19:03.450" style="s2">it&#39;s worth talking about only in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.899" end="00:19:05.129" style="s2">context of look Brian Rose wants to use</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.450" end="00:19:06.869" style="s2">your fundraising and I&#39;m talking to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.129" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">audience here the people who you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.869" end="00:19:11.940" style="s2">donated to Brian rose he wants to use</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:15.059" style="s2">that to hire more staff look look at his</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.940" end="00:19:18.210" style="s2">phase 6 it&#39;s higher 20 people for</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.059" end="00:19:20.519" style="s2">digital blah blah blah blah blah he just</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.210" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">fired people like that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.519" end="00:19:24.029" style="s2">brought brought to light at all after</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:25.950" style="s2">right after firing people</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.029" end="00:19:28.259" style="s2">he&#39;s fundraising to hire people so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.950" end="00:19:30.360" style="s2">just moving people off his payroll and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.259" end="00:19:32.100" style="s2">moving it right on to the audiences</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.360" end="00:19:33.269" style="s2">payroll and I think people should be</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.100" end="00:19:34.950" style="s2">upset about I think they have the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.269" end="00:19:38.159" style="s2">to be upset about it because things</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.950" end="00:19:40.919" style="s2">aren&#39;t being transparently communicated</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.159" end="00:19:42.149" style="s2">here yeah I wanted to also just ask</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.919" end="00:19:44.669" style="s2">because something you said yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.149" end="00:19:45.899" style="s2">when we when we chatted before this made</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.669" end="00:19:49.559" style="s2">a lot of sense and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.899" end="00:19:51.659" style="s2">been spelled out and that is just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.559" end="00:19:53.519" style="s2">major kind of issue with the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.659" end="00:19:56.509" style="s2">because also in his in his latest</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.519" end="00:19:58.980" style="s2">message he said yes I used dailymotion</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.509" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">which was a part of the the initial film</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.980" end="00:20:02.200" style="s2">that I put out like actually he&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:04.300" style="s2">dailymotion it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.200" end="00:20:06.730" style="s2">not a private streaming but you you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.300" end="00:20:09.610" style="s2">actually kind of flagged up that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.730" end="00:20:11.560" style="s2">no real reason given that he&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.610" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">said look I&#39;ll use free platforms and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.560" end="00:20:15.790" style="s2">save your money if like if I can because</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:18.100" style="s2">I&#39;m caring about how I&#39;m spending your</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.790" end="00:20:19.630" style="s2">money there&#39;s no real reason to him to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.100" end="00:20:21.700" style="s2">be doing any of this because you should</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.630" end="00:20:23.080" style="s2">be using bit sheet it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.700" end="00:20:25.000" style="s2">funniest thing in the world to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.080" end="00:20:26.800" style="s2">because it makes zero sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.000" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">as soon as Brian Rose said that I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.800" end="00:20:29.980" style="s2">like okay your whole thing makes zero</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:31.390" style="s2">since you&#39;ve raised all this money for</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.980" end="00:20:32.950" style="s2">nothing other than yourself and your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.390" end="00:20:35.020" style="s2">ego about having your own platform</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.950" end="00:20:37.150" style="s2">because listen guys listen to me for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.020" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">second okay think about it this way what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.150" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">costs all the money</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:42.610" style="s2">live streaming why not just do like put</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:44.830" style="s2">it on bit shoot right they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.610" end="00:20:46.540" style="s2">to censor you this thing already exists</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.830" end="00:20:48.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to pay for it your your</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.540" end="00:20:50.680" style="s2">supporters sure don&#39;t have to pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.120" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">embed it in your platform and then all</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.680" end="00:20:54.130" style="s2">of a sudden say this guy&#39;s we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:55.630" style="s2">gonna do it live what&#39;s so hard about</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.130" end="00:20:57.700" style="s2">that why does he need to do it live it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.630" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">not like he&#39;s he&#39;s a twitch streamer who</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.700" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">reads off donations it&#39;s not like he</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:03.550" style="s2">interacts with the audience</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:05.560" style="s2">give me one rationale for why</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.550" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">live-streaming is so critical when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.560" end="00:21:08.230" style="s2">the most expensive part and he says in</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:10.150" style="s2">his little thing right</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.230" end="00:21:12.220" style="s2">I&#39;m extremely frugal I would never spend</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.150" end="00:21:13.690" style="s2">your money if I don&#39;t have to but all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.220" end="00:21:15.460" style="s2">a sudden there&#39;s this ego trip about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.690" end="00:21:17.170" style="s2">has to go up live why the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.460" end="00:21:19.300" style="s2">people who watch content are watching it</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.170" end="00:21:21.790" style="s2">pre-recorded like that&#39;s just how it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.300" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">works it&#39;s fine and also you can pre</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.790" end="00:21:25.870" style="s2">record and do a premiere like people do</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:28.600" style="s2">on YouTube kind of simulate the liveness</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.870" end="00:21:30.040" style="s2">of it I mean I always rag on people for</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.600" end="00:21:31.720" style="s2">doing pre-recorded webinars and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.040" end="00:21:33.730" style="s2">pretending it&#39;s live but this would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.720" end="00:21:36.610" style="s2">the one instance where I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.730" end="00:21:38.530" style="s2">give Brian Rose full permission and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.610" end="00:21:41.260" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t rag on him for doing a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.530" end="00:21:43.090" style="s2">pre-recorded live webinar if it was to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.260" end="00:21:45.310" style="s2">save people millions of dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.090" end="00:21:48.010" style="s2">pointless live streaming costs that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.310" end="00:21:51.340" style="s2">ultimately again what does it serve</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.010" end="00:21:53.740" style="s2">except for Brian Rose&#39;s ego to think</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.340" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">about two two possibilities one he</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.740" end="00:21:57.460" style="s2">builds his digital freedom platform for</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:21:59.470" style="s2">millions of dollars and you get a live</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.460" end="00:22:02.800" style="s2">stream the other is he just embeds it on</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.470" end="00:22:04.930" style="s2">bit shoot where costs $0 tell me the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.800" end="00:22:06.850" style="s2">difference in actual like practice if</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.930" end="00:22:10.300" style="s2">you if I don&#39;t think Brian Rose can do</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.850" end="00:22:11.710" style="s2">it it makes zero sense it&#39;s gets me</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.300" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">fired up because this is the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.710" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">this is the entire thing is he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:17.430" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:18.840" style="s2">I&#39;m frugal I&#39;m doing it for you guys got</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.430" end="00:22:20.550" style="s2">it out we don&#39;t have a digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.840" end="00:22:22.860" style="s2">platform the most egotistical thing I</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.550" end="00:22:25.140" style="s2">ever heard was we&#39;re creating the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.860" end="00:22:27.930" style="s2">ever ever digital freedom platform it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.140" end="00:22:29.400" style="s2">not in accepted name only like people</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.930" end="00:22:30.510" style="s2">like bitch should have been doing this</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.400" end="00:22:32.160" style="s2">forever there&#39;s a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.510" end="00:22:34.230" style="s2">platforms as well who are freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.160" end="00:22:36.740" style="s2">speech like platforms this is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.230" end="00:22:39.000" style="s2">Brian&#39;s own spin-off and his own</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.740" end="00:22:40.770" style="s2">egotistical you know ramblings about</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.000" end="00:22:42.060" style="s2">yeah this is the first one ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.770" end="00:22:44.010" style="s2">absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.060" end="00:22:48.030" style="s2">yeah and this is this is a slight segue</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.010" end="00:22:51.290" style="s2">but it&#39;s why so you go back to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.030" end="00:22:54.390" style="s2">the platform wars patreon for example</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.290" end="00:22:56.610" style="s2">there was a whole thing I think around</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.390" end="00:22:59.370" style="s2">Christmas last year or the year before</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.610" end="00:23:02.450" style="s2">where patreon kicked off sargon of akkad</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.370" end="00:23:06.060" style="s2">and sam harris left Jordan Pederson left</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.450" end="00:23:08.010" style="s2">we left rebel wisdom left we we now only</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.060" end="00:23:10.470" style="s2">have a sign up on our website because</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.010" end="00:23:12.420" style="s2">we&#39;re like we don&#39;t want to be at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.470" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">mercy of these big tech platforms just</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.420" end="00:23:16.950" style="s2">making decisions on who who gets to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:19.260" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s a person and who&#39;s a nun</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.950" end="00:23:20.580" style="s2">person and so a lot of us dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.260" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">these issues back then we thought about</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.580" end="00:23:25.320" style="s2">these questions and obviously Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:27.480" style="s2">peed and went Peterson went off and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.320" end="00:23:28.860" style="s2">created think spot the platform because</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.480" end="00:23:31.950" style="s2">if you go and create a platform you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.860" end="00:23:33.900" style="s2">to wrestle with actual issues like if</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.950" end="00:23:35.310" style="s2">Brian Rose had gone off and said look we</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.900" end="00:23:38.580" style="s2">need to create a digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.310" end="00:23:40.050" style="s2">platform and now are now aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.580" end="00:23:41.910" style="s2">other people who wanted to do this</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.050" end="00:23:43.890" style="s2">because we&#39;re all worried about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.910" end="00:23:46.800" style="s2">issue that would have been a completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.890" end="00:23:48.150" style="s2">different dynamic because in that but in</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.800" end="00:23:49.350" style="s2">that dynamic he would have actually had</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.150" end="00:23:50.760" style="s2">to face some of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.350" end="00:23:54.750" style="s2">everyone else has had to face when they</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.760" end="00:23:57.320" style="s2">when they deal with this which is one do</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.750" end="00:23:59.670" style="s2">you allow Nazis on your platform like</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.320" end="00:24:01.590" style="s2">are you gonna have any gatekeeping</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.670" end="00:24:03.930" style="s2">whatsoever who&#39;s gonna make those</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.590" end="00:24:05.940" style="s2">decisions like we all you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.930" end="00:24:08.820" style="s2">those questions if you actually deal</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.940" end="00:24:10.050" style="s2">with the problem properly but he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.820" end="00:24:11.790" style="s2">deal with the problem properly he just</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.050" end="00:24:13.410" style="s2">basically said okay I&#39;ll create this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.790" end="00:24:15.270" style="s2">thing called a digital freedom platform</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.410" end="00:24:16.710" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be independent of London</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.270" end="00:24:18.180" style="s2">real even though it&#39;s not it&#39;s fully</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.710" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">owned by him and it&#39;s embedded within</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.180" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">the London real website can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:23.700" style="s2">about that for a second because I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:26.940" style="s2">that&#39;s like the weirdest thing that he</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.700" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">calls it a dependent when it&#39;s not um I</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.940" end="00:24:28.620" style="s2">think it&#39;s worth just playing the clip</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:30.990" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.620" end="00:24:34.040" style="s2">sort of back up that he did definitely</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.990" end="00:24:34.040" style="s2">declare that was going to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.790" end="00:24:49.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that I can&#39;t get my</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.530" end="00:24:50.520" style="s2">head around is why he ever said that if</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.020" end="00:24:52.530" style="s2">it was always going to be hosted within</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.520" end="00:24:56.160" style="s2">the London real website and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.530" end="00:24:58.200" style="s2">mentioned something that because you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.160" end="00:25:00.840" style="s2">called the cast to find out how much the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.200" end="00:25:03.090" style="s2">the stream was going to be or the stream</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.840" end="00:25:07.170" style="s2">had been for the IKE interview and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.090" end="00:25:10.050" style="s2">said so you&#39;ve got a figure for that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.170" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">you also he kind of conceded that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.050" end="00:25:13.320" style="s2">also worked out with that that was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:14.130" style="s2">tacit admission what wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.320" end="00:25:16.020" style="s2">explain that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.130" end="00:25:18.090" style="s2">sure yeah I&#39;d love to first of all let</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.020" end="00:25:20.070" style="s2">me take a big w on this because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.090" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">in my comment section was saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.070" end="00:25:24.630" style="s2">was wrong about how much it cost and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:26.370" style="s2">like I was incorrect because of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.630" end="00:25:29.250" style="s2">some technicality about what they said I</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.370" end="00:25:32.220" style="s2">said it was 60 mm the real cost was 61</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.250" end="00:25:35.400" style="s2">thousand or I might have that flip so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.220" end="00:25:38.429" style="s2">was dead on okay let me let me hold that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.400" end="00:25:41.309" style="s2">real quick okay I&#39;m done but the second</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.429" end="00:25:42.630" style="s2">thing was about concerning the the rest</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.309" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">of the money right because he goes oh no</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.630" end="00:25:46.890" style="s2">it really did cost $100,000 well why if</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:48.750" style="s2">it only costs $60,000 to live shrimp</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.890" end="00:25:50.730" style="s2">let&#39;s just recap I think you&#39;ve said a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.750" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">lot that maybe people weren&#39;t aware they</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.730" end="00:25:54.420" style="s2">might not be following oh sure basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:56.580" style="s2">he claimed it was gonna be a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.420" end="00:26:00.420" style="s2">thousand dollars to stream like three</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.580" end="00:26:01.679" style="s2">yes it was found out a few people found</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.420" end="00:26:04.290" style="s2">out that it was done through day cast</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.679" end="00:26:06.660" style="s2">knew called they cast and they said oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.290" end="00:26:07.770" style="s2">hang on you said I want to stream to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.660" end="00:26:09.179" style="s2">million people how much would that cost</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.770" end="00:26:11.250" style="s2">and they said oh actually we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.179" end="00:26:18.600" style="s2">done that this weekend and it cost sixty</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.250" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">one thousand dollars that&#39;s correct yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.600" end="00:26:22.290" style="s2">and so Brian Rose later concedes that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:23.970" style="s2">point in in his little update or</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.290" end="00:26:26.610" style="s2">whatever but then he quickly follows it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.970" end="00:26:28.800" style="s2">up with hey whoa wait but we had to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.610" end="00:26:31.920" style="s2">upgrade the servers on London real in</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.800" end="00:26:33.690" style="s2">order to handle the the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.920" end="00:26:35.220" style="s2">on the platform so not only do you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.690" end="00:26:37.260" style="s2">to have live streaming bandwidth but you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.220" end="00:26:39.900" style="s2">also have to have server bandwidth for</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.260" end="00:26:42.509" style="s2">your actual website itself but hang on</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.900" end="00:26:44.849" style="s2">because that&#39;s upgrading London real</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.509" end="00:26:46.499" style="s2">supposedly should be independent from</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.849" end="00:26:48.209" style="s2">the digital freedom platform so again</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.499" end="00:26:50.669" style="s2">the digital freedom platform is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.209" end="00:26:52.529" style="s2">completely separate entity so he spent</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.669" end="00:26:54.449" style="s2">sixty thousand dollars on the digital</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.529" end="00:26:56.639" style="s2">freedom platform forty thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.449" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">upgrading his personal servers for line</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.639" end="00:27:02.759" style="s2">and reel so it&#39;s not at all you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:04.049" style="s2">using money that your donators gave you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.759" end="00:27:06.349" style="s2">that you said wouldn&#39;t be used for</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.049" end="00:27:08.459" style="s2">London real to upgrade London real</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.349" end="00:27:10.289" style="s2">because that&#39;s where the digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.459" end="00:27:12.899" style="s2">platform is and now he&#39;s he&#39;s spending</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.289" end="00:27:14.039" style="s2">some new thing about oh no I had to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.899" end="00:27:17.669" style="s2">that because there&#39;s in such a short</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.039" end="00:27:19.949" style="s2">timeframe now moving over but this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.669" end="00:27:22.829" style="s2">one of a one of many things where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.949" end="00:27:24.869" style="s2">trying to like after the fact spin up</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.829" end="00:27:27.329" style="s2">new narratives spin up some new</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.869" end="00:27:29.459" style="s2">explanation the whole problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.329" end="00:27:32.069" style="s2">the things he&#39;s saying turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.459" end="00:27:33.629" style="s2">lies him saying that he&#39;s gonna stop</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.069" end="00:27:36.059" style="s2">fundraising he can maybe create a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.629" end="00:27:38.129" style="s2">rational afterwards but it turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.059" end="00:27:39.690" style="s2">be a lie him saying that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.129" end="00:27:40.979" style="s2">independent thing that he&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.690" end="00:27:43.139" style="s2">spend money from digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.979" end="00:27:45.029" style="s2">platform on lended real that is a lie he</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.139" end="00:27:45.719" style="s2">admitted it in a video anyone can watch</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.029" end="00:27:47.519" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.719" end="00:27:50.789" style="s2">that he spent at least forty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.519" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">dollars or more on server space and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.789" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">upgrades and whatever for London real it</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:28:00.059" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense yeah and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:03.389" style="s2">ask about the the other kind of business</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.059" end="00:28:06.029" style="s2">practices because obviously he as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.389" end="00:28:07.739" style="s2">conceived from the the socialblade stats</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.029" end="00:28:09.659" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of visitors to London</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.659" end="00:28:14.940" style="s2">freedom platform was given their email</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.770" end="00:30:54.610" style="s2">promoting that scheme because now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.930" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">made his money and he can move on</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.610" end="00:30:58.060" style="s2">because the event had already happened</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:31:00.820" style="s2">but then let&#39;s just stop let&#39;s just stop</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.060" end="00:31:02.170" style="s2">that because sir I did see I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.820" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">notice that they have been deleted until</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.170" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">you pointed it out but so he sent he</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:09.909" style="s2">sent the email out to his supporters</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:12.190" style="s2">then had like two or three videos on</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.909" end="00:31:14.230" style="s2">London real it was like four or five it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.190" end="00:31:17.080" style="s2">was like four or five is a lot with with</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.080" end="00:31:22.899" style="s2">then afterwards deleted those videos</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.690" end="00:31:24.250" style="s2">which in itself is kind of bizarre thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.899" end="00:31:26.110" style="s2">to do I mean he probably claimed that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.250" end="00:31:27.940" style="s2">YouTube took them down maybe but that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.110" end="00:31:29.320" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t make any sense because you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.940" end="00:31:31.269" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of other tika to worry</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.320" end="00:31:33.490" style="s2">videos up so they&#39;re not taking down</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.269" end="00:31:34.149" style="s2">ticket to worry videos no Brian took</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.149" end="00:31:38.500" style="s2">I feel confident saying that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.700" end="00:31:41.139" style="s2">because he got a backlash on it he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.500" end="00:31:42.850" style="s2">talk about like freedom and not give</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.139" end="00:31:44.590" style="s2">transparency ride up to the point when</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.850" end="00:31:46.990" style="s2">he&#39;s criticized and then he will change</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.590" end="00:31:48.580" style="s2">tact right he go he promotes this crypto</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.990" end="00:31:49.899" style="s2">thing right before he&#39;s criticized then</p>

<p begin="00:31:58.630" end="00:32:01.299" style="s2">to the point where he gets criticized</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:03.159" style="s2">then he turns around and says no no</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.299" end="00:32:04.510" style="s2">actually I&#39;m ready to be transparent</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.559" end="00:32:31.090" style="s2">some of these tactics because they seem</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.049" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">very like there&#39;s real similarities</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.090" end="00:32:36.190" style="s2">between that and sort of quite kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:39.100" style="s2">culty dynamics like creating in groups</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.190" end="00:32:41.110" style="s2">out groups not accepting criticism like</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:15.010" style="s2">do you pay attention to it without</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.430" end="00:36:18.410" style="s2">getting drawn into that same dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.010" end="00:36:20.390" style="s2">yourself how do I get drawn into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.410" end="00:36:23.710" style="s2">looking at it making films about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.390" end="00:36:27.080" style="s2">without just feeding that dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.710" end="00:36:29.180" style="s2">one of them is this sort of and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.080" end="00:36:30.920" style="s2">the morality tale like the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.180" end="00:36:32.600" style="s2">dimensions and the morality tale of is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.920" end="00:36:35.210" style="s2">also just such a fascinating thing to</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.210" end="00:36:41.240" style="s2">now to be in that space what must it be</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:44.990" style="s2">like to be to have built what looks to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.240" end="00:36:47.360" style="s2">me into you like a kind of a trap for</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.990" end="00:36:49.190" style="s2">yourself like it seems certainly on</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.360" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">Sunday and some of the comments of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.190" end="00:36:54.310" style="s2">latest videos it does seem like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:56.630" style="s2">audience is really starting to turn and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.310" end="00:36:58.370" style="s2">because it&#39;s one thing to put out a film</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.630" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">that people don&#39;t like it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.370" end="00:37:05.900" style="s2">thing to take lots of money off people</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:07.640" style="s2">and then insult them for asking you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.900" end="00:37:09.590" style="s2">questions like that&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.640" end="00:37:11.360" style="s2">dynamic like it&#39;s hard enough when</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.590" end="00:37:12.650" style="s2">you&#39;re when when you put out a film that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.360" end="00:37:14.030" style="s2">your audience doesn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.650" end="00:37:15.650" style="s2">god knows what it&#39;s like what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.030" end="00:37:16.970" style="s2">actually taken lots of money off them</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.650" end="00:37:18.140" style="s2">for something and they&#39;re asking hey man</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.970" end="00:37:22.100" style="s2">what happened to my money what happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.140" end="00:37:24.410" style="s2">to this platform and so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.100" end="00:37:26.030" style="s2">psychological dimension of and someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.410" end="00:37:28.850" style="s2">who&#39;s been open in the past about having</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.030" end="00:37:30.830" style="s2">had addiction problems about having it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.850" end="00:37:32.750" style="s2">like and I think a lot of people feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.830" end="00:37:34.550" style="s2">that they know him like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.750" end="00:37:35.780" style="s2">part of the the journey with London real</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.550" end="00:37:39.320" style="s2">is that people feel that they know who</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.780" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">Brian Rose is to some degree and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.320" end="00:37:43.210" style="s2">I said in my first film</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:46.190" style="s2">my sense is there are two Brian roses</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.210" end="00:37:48.440" style="s2">there&#39;s the there&#39;s the businessman</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.190" end="00:37:51.350" style="s2">mentored by Dan penny</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.440" end="00:37:53.940" style="s2">who is just this sort of ruthless</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.350" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">shafted grandmother to get ahead kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.940" end="00:37:58.950" style="s2">American and then there&#39;s also the guy</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:01.710" style="s2">who was honest about his addiction</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.950" end="00:38:03.960" style="s2">problems and has like those two things</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.710" end="00:38:06.270" style="s2">exist at the same time I&#39;ve had more</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.960" end="00:38:07.770" style="s2">than one person who knows Brian Rose has</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.270" end="00:38:10.080" style="s2">known Brian Rose for a while say that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.770" end="00:38:11.970" style="s2">that was absolutely accurate you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.080" end="00:38:13.470" style="s2">almost picture him with like the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.970" end="00:38:16.190" style="s2">better and the worse angels of his</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.470" end="00:38:19.140" style="s2">nature on boat on either side and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.190" end="00:38:21.540" style="s2">he&#39;s been more and more swayed towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.140" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">sort of the dan pena the multilevel</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.540" end="00:38:27.600" style="s2">marketing the just kind of use your</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:30.750" style="s2">gather as many emails as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.600" end="00:38:33.120" style="s2">use it to to kind of get as much out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.750" end="00:38:36.390" style="s2">your followers as you can and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.120" end="00:38:38.970" style="s2">been a trajectory and I don&#39;t see a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.390" end="00:38:43.410" style="s2">out that does not involve some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.970" end="00:38:47.220" style="s2">Mia culpa some kind of apology but human</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.410" end="00:38:50.940" style="s2">psychology is very difficult like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.220" end="00:39:01.020" style="s2">actually do that is extremely difficult</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.940" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">and I wonder how I don&#39;t know I and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.020" end="00:39:05.190" style="s2">that&#39;s part of this as well is like I</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:06.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know when when and if something</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.190" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">like this comes crashing down what</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.660" end="00:39:15.150" style="s2">people do and I think realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.400" end="00:39:19.110" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah the balance of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.150" end="00:39:20.940" style="s2">rights and responsibilities of do I have</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.110" end="00:39:23.730" style="s2">a responsibility to call this out I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.940" end="00:39:26.730" style="s2">think so as I said in my first film I</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.730" end="00:39:29.100" style="s2">think the whole double bind of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.730" end="00:39:35.240" style="s2">of speech is that we have to use it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.100" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">it becomes a a self-correcting process</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.240" end="00:39:39.870" style="s2">or we&#39;re probably going to lose it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:42.930" style="s2">because the big tech platforms are just</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.870" end="00:39:46.590" style="s2">gonna say we&#39;re gonna decide who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.930" end="00:39:48.270" style="s2">allowed to speak and who isn&#39;t so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.590" end="00:39:50.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of wrestled with with this</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.270" end="00:39:54.390" style="s2">from the beginning of like how can you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.460" end="00:40:00.510" style="s2">do this in a way that is honest is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.390" end="00:40:01.950" style="s2">authentic is not not seeing someone as</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.510" end="00:40:07.260" style="s2">an enemy that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.950" end="00:40:11.730" style="s2">attacked but as someone who is like in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.260" end="00:40:13.530" style="s2">some ways there go all of us like some</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.730" end="00:40:15.660" style="s2">of the some of the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.530" end="00:40:17.430" style="s2">this brings up to me is like the weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.660" end="00:40:19.800" style="s2">incentive structures of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.430" end="00:40:23.250" style="s2">media sure like that there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.800" end="00:40:25.470" style="s2">these so basically this whole business</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.250" end="00:40:28.470" style="s2">model of you have 2 million YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.470" end="00:40:30.750" style="s2">subscribers there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.470" end="00:40:33.000" style="s2">lot of places like this now which have I</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.750" end="00:40:35.130" style="s2">find in different ways to monetize</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.000" end="00:40:36.930" style="s2">attention they have attention through</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.130" end="00:40:38.460" style="s2">the people they&#39;ve got on they get more</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.930" end="00:40:41.780" style="s2">people to go on because of the all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.460" end="00:40:44.250" style="s2">other people they&#39;ve had go on so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.780" end="00:40:46.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of those around there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:49.310" style="s2">lot of those around and the temptation</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.890" end="00:40:51.450" style="s2">to like I mean rebel wisdom has</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.310" end="00:40:54.780" style="s2">something like that as a business model</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.450" end="00:40:56.430" style="s2">in that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a media channel</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.780" end="00:40:58.619" style="s2">first and foremost but we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.430" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">pay the bills we have memberships we run</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.619" end="00:41:03.450" style="s2">online courses so those so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:05.490" style="s2">just say oh the business model is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.450" end="00:41:07.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a much more nuanced conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.490" end="00:41:08.849" style="s2">than that it&#39;s like how can you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.500" end="00:41:11.130" style="s2">when you&#39;re being authentic and when</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.849" end="00:41:12.869" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not being authentic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.130" end="00:41:15.450" style="s2">let me jump jump in here real quick cuz</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.869" end="00:41:18.869" style="s2">I think I think it&#39;s fair to say that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.450" end="00:41:21.810" style="s2">okay maybe you know if I were in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.869" end="00:41:24.270" style="s2">same shoes there go I whatever but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.810" end="00:41:27.150" style="s2">think at the same time you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.270" end="00:41:29.460" style="s2">aware that what he&#39;s done has when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.150" end="00:41:31.950" style="s2">descend into the particular you can see</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.460" end="00:41:34.290" style="s2">some definitely areas where he just went</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.950" end="00:41:36.990" style="s2">wrong where he&#39;s talking about head</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.290" end="00:41:38.190" style="s2">faking his audience you can&#39;t do that to</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.990" end="00:41:39.900" style="s2">an audience when you&#39;re raising a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.190" end="00:41:42.660" style="s2">million dollars you just can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:51.480" style="s2">reason that he&#39;s in the position that he</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.380" end="00:42:53.579" style="s2">is I heard a friend of mine who was</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.579" end="00:42:57.059" style="s2">sums up the way a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.230" end="00:42:59.010" style="s2">feeling right now he goes man it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.059" end="00:43:01.470" style="s2">a shame what&#39;s been going on with London</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.010" end="00:43:02.700" style="s2">real because the guy had so many great</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.470" end="00:43:04.349" style="s2">guests on he goes I don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.700" end="00:43:06.030" style="s2">everything the guy said but he had some</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.349" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">really great guests on and he was</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.030" end="00:43:11.549" style="s2">building a long-term reputation that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:13.500" style="s2">gonna kind of last and build into</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.549" end="00:43:16.049" style="s2">something sort of greater than what</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.500" end="00:43:18.329" style="s2">London real currently is and that has</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.049" end="00:43:20.700" style="s2">sort of been traded I mean this person</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.329" end="00:43:21.960" style="s2">that had a pretty decent amount of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.700" end="00:43:24.210" style="s2">respect for this person it&#39;s close to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.960" end="00:43:25.829" style="s2">friend of mine no longer has that</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.540" end="00:43:31.619" style="s2">guy who&#39;s having all the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.460" end="00:43:33.480" style="s2">theorists on who&#39;s you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.619" end="00:43:35.910" style="s2">lying about the way he&#39;s handling this</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.480" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">money no he&#39;s not going to anymore and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.910" end="00:43:39.839" style="s2">think a lot of people are wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">this London real they had in their mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.839" end="00:43:44.970" style="s2">like six weeks ago versus the London</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:46.250" style="s2">real and the actions of Brian Rose that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.970" end="00:43:50.040" style="s2">they see before them today</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.250" end="00:43:51.750" style="s2">nice little rant to end on sorry no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.040" end="00:43:53.910" style="s2">good it was good I think I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.750" end="00:43:56.069" style="s2">right you&#39;re right I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to</p>

<p begin="00:43:56.069" end="00:44:01.790" style="s2">same time I think you&#39;re right in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.079" end="00:44:04.950" style="s2">that I&#39;m wary of that dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.790" end="00:44:06.450" style="s2">unexamined judgment of other people</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.950" end="00:44:08.579" style="s2">because that comes back and bite you in</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.450" end="00:44:10.500" style="s2">the ass as well it sure does which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.579" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">why I think it&#39;s important to say and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.500" end="00:44:14.190" style="s2">said it in my video yesterday but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:16.309" style="s2">think that we should say here we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.190" end="00:44:18.690" style="s2">both reached out to Brian Rose on</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.309" end="00:44:22.020" style="s2">numerous occasions to give him the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.690" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">chance to respond we have I&#39;ve emailed</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.020" end="00:44:26.069" style="s2">him four times David how many times do</p>

<p begin="00:44:31.980" end="00:44:38.520" style="s2">judgment in the effort of getting an</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.200" end="00:44:40.109" style="s2">understood full 360 of the situation it</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.520" end="00:44:42.270" style="s2">has not been us that is unwilling to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.109" end="00:44:44.190" style="s2">come to the table unfortunately it has</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.270" end="00:44:45.750" style="s2">been Brian Rose for what he may have his</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.190" end="00:44:48.869" style="s2">own reasons they might be good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.750" end="00:44:50.910" style="s2">but it&#39;s been his decision to leave the</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.910" end="00:44:54.780" style="s2">the full picture and unfortunately if</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.980" end="00:44:56.970" style="s2">that creates a skewed perspective at</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.780" end="00:45:01.020" style="s2">some point that cannot be placed on our</p>
