<p begin="00:00:03.199" end="00:00:06.240" style="s2">the stoa is a digital campfire where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.680" end="00:00:08.800" style="s2">cohere</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">and dialogue about what matters most at</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.800" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">the knife&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.520" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">so me and maria clara we co-founded uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.160" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">together the project uh called this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">not the truth</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a project based on</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">youtube channel mainly we created</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:33.520" style="s2">content we did a web series i think some</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:38.000" style="s2">uh watched it the commentary series</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">called what what is emerging</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:42.879" style="s2">and we released that a year ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:44.320" style="s2">and apart from that series we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">doing um</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.320" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">some other interviews that are on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">web channel and we have a channel on</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.440" style="s2">instagram as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">the idea with this project this is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">the truth is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">investigate emerging narratives for</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">so we were on a quest when we first met</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">at schumacher college in the uk apart</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">from the fact that we are brazilian we</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">are not from the same city in brazil</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">so we met when we were in england and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">started this project a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">and that has been one of our main</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:21.040" style="s2">occupations</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">until now but tonight we were here</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">actually to talk about other projects</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:29.360" style="s2">that i take part is the collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">gesturing towards the colonial futures</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.360" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s called gtdf collective i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">put the link here afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">and this is also related to the research</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">that i do together with maria clara but</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not always translated into like</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">video content as we do with this is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">the truth it&#39;s usually more</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">research in the field we work a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">and mainly we work with pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">on how we can move out of the frames of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">modernity that we are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">stuck in so that&#39;s a brief introduction</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">maria let&#39;s see if we can hear you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">sorry everyone is that i&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">countryside so the internet is totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">so sorry for that i see that camille</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">talked briefly about the gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">towards the colonial future</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">collective so my question would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">what is gesturing towards the colonial</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">futures</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">so yeah i was just talking like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">structure of the collective i&#39;ll tell a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">the story right it&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">connected to canada</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">because it was started by a professor</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">that is now</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">that has been teaching in ubc in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">for quite a while now and this teacher</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">is vanessa andreochi</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">and she&#39;s brazilian but she has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">living in canada for a while</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">and she has a chair in race inequality</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">and global education</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">at ubc so she started she started the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">gesturing towards the colonial futures</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">as a space where we could do</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">experimental pedagogical research</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">on how we could move away from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">colonial forms of being and living that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">we are usually trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">and every time we try to do something</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">different we try to like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">fix something or go more sustainable or</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">be more just</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">or inclusive and things like that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">quite a few here are familiar with those</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">a lot of times we feel ourselves trapped</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">in the same kind of paradigm and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">repeating the same kind of mistakes even</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">though we have a different intention</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">so so we&#39;ve been doing pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">the collective exists for five years</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">more or less</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">i&#39;ve joined for uh two years now</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s there&#39;s this connection directly</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">to canada because</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">of professor vanessa andreyochi and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">with some of the indigenous nations in</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">canada that she works more directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">and as i&#39;m based in brazil i work with</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">the international researchers</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">and with the indigenous researchers from</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">brazil and latin america so brazil peru</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">and mexico</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a brief introduction about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">the collection so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">yeah i i wonder um about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">the time of the the frame of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">coloniality</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">you engage in the collective because in</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">latin america we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">thinkers like lelia gonzalez that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">engages</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">like a black feminist terrorist in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">the colonial movement we have also</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">julieta paredes who has</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2">a more intention connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">indigenous communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.960" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">also some of them that talk a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">about echo feminism</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">connected to the the coloniality so what</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">the main approach to the coloniality</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">yes this world is quite uh used nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">i guess</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">also in canada so the colonial studies</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">is sort of everywhere and applied to all</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">sorts of areas</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">and the specific way that we see</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">uh the coloniality from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">view of the gtdf collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.840" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">experiences experiments is that we see</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">coloniality</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">starting when we first started to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">separated from the land</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">so the separation between humans and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">land that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">step on that we live in so the earth as</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">not only like the earth as a system but</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">the earth as</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">the land itself where we step when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">started to detach</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">ourselves from that we see that process</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">as a start of a colonial process we</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">started colonizing the land</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">and from colonizing the land we started</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">colonizing one another and other human</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">and then all the violence and systemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">and historical violence that we see</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">perpetuated</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s a core point of view</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">we don&#39;t see coloniality starting</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">when european people came to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">americas</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">right it was long before that of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">that had</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">a huge impact as well but</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">it&#39;s not the case to address that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">and the other thing that i think is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">uh core vision of the collective is also</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t see we don&#39;t see a separation</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">between the unsustainable ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">live in earth so we know that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">living in modern ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">that are not sustainable for the planets</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">that we have so if we keep going in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">it&#39;s going to end soon like resources</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">are not enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:03.280" style="s2">and this is deeply deeply connected to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">the historical and systemic violence</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.280" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">that we see</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">with different people and not only like</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">indigenous nations but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">with people that are always um on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">bottom of the system or something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">that like in the south of the south and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">so we don&#39;t see that separate we always</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">analyze</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">and we always do practices and we always</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.960" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">try to understand the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:29.199" style="s2">the our</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">in sustainable ways ways of living and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">the systemic violence</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t we do not sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">allow in our minds the separation</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">um because of what i was talking in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">usually when we do the separation we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">being violent</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">again either with the earth or with some</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">some population so</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">we try to put that together always in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">critical way</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">i wonder if you could talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">more about the methods</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">that you guys use to engage because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">it&#39;s like we are trapped so how do see</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">outside this</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">frame that it&#39;s kind of immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">every little thing we we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">so maybe the social cartographies and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">the house of modernity that is the one</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">i&#39;m most familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">it&#39;s a very good thing to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;ve been working with</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">educational experiments so both like</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">courses like formal courses in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">universities for example when i saw</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">this teacher that is connected to ubc</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">there&#39;s another teacher</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">in durham in england also</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">so a little bit of experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">experiments happens inside the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">university but most of it happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">outside of university</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:52.839" style="s2">in an informal way so before</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">this situation that we are living in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.839" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">we used to have like uh immersion</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">courses so sort of like retreats</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">where we would go for a week and have</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">layers of of learning together and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">uh uh together</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">in place right so the best way would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">to for people to go on a workshop that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">they&#39;re immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">a lot of time and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">this there was a base for this</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">experiments to happen that was in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">slovenia in in slovenia in eastern</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">and we used to go there like every every</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">summer for four years the collective has</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">been doing work</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">there with a lot of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">activists or working with education or</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">or towards other ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">being in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">uh now we are trying more and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">online versions</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">so we are having online courses and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">study groups as well and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">bring this experience that was super</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">based on the present</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">to an online way and apart from slovenia</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.399" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">me and gino my partner we have started</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">here in brazil</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">a project called tehadentro where we</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">work here</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">a lot with brazilian people both</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">indigenous and non-indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">trying to understand where when is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">that is uh suitable for us to be working</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">together and when we did</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">that that we are doing like some work</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">with white people</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">uh mainly because it&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">work to be done</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:32.880" style="s2">so yeah in these pedagogical experiments</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">either offline</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.880" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">or online now we work a lot with social</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.839" end="00:10:39.200" style="s2">cartographies</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if everyone is familiar</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">with but</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">one easy way to to explain is to compare</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">it with</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">theories theories are more like a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.279" style="s2">of knowing that you got to that theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">and then you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.279" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">work from that social cartographies are</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">just like coming to a very simple point</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">would be like</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">drawings of a system that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">and then we can open a conversation from</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">that social cartography so social</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">cartography</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:11.360" style="s2">is easier and playful and it just moves</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.360" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t fix the knowledge so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">understand knowledge as something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">that should move us towards something</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">and then we talk a lot also uh about</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">what is the direction that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">move right with this</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">uh knowledge that is not fixed so where</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">are we going</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">so instead of moving forward forward</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">like to the front</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">as modernity usually brings us to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">is the best way right let&#39;s go forward</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">let&#39;s go further</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">we try to take take things deeper</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">so we try to to understand the relation</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">with direction in a different way and by</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">breaking that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:55.920" style="s2">in our minds by understanding that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">not moving forward it&#39;s not a resolution</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.920" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not solution oriented</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not a final answer it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">one truth and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">that is really a base of the modernity</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">uh we try to go deeper and to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">what are the spirals that can bring us</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">deeper</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">so work is done with a lot of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">we put out social cartography for</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">example house of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">and then we can have a talk also</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">actually if we have the time</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">this is this is one of the cartographers</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">to share a little bit with you and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">we work with other ways of exercising</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">our body in the space and to relate our</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">bodies to nature</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">to understand ourselves more connected</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.200" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">metabolism that we are inserted in so to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">bring back</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">those connections that we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">in ourselves and that we are connected</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">to a larger systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">but a lot of times we are not used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">read that so we don&#39;t have the language</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">to have this this relation anymore we</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have the language that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">intermediates these relations</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:07.519" style="s2">so we try to playfully with art</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">sometimes sometimes with indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">practices sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">yeah just experimenting with the earth</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">to try</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">to get those connections back</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">maybe you could share a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">more about the house of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">because i really think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">it&#39;s good maybe i don&#39;t know if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:35.440" style="s2">are familiar with the this frame because</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">for me it really gives a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.440" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">a view that is different and the sensing</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">of the what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">so maybe what do you guys think to share</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">the house of modernity cool not cool</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">let me see if i find a quick link here</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">to see the drawing</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">just a second</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">maybe gino can you help me</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">i&#39;m asking someone that is here okay i</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">will start talking and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">then if if i find the link i will put it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">out on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">chat but the house of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">the idea is to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">we have a modernity has built</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">one big big house on the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">so we live in this big house that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">earth cannot</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">sustain anymore so what we try to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">usually is to include people inside the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">house so we&#39;re like oh here in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">house of modernity is so comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">we have everything we have access we</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">have technology we have like health</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">and research and we have what we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">and we use the resources</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">but the problem is that not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">fits sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">on the house i think gino sent</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">the the link there so if people want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">to have a look at the house or should i</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">share here on the screen</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">you want to share it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">just this the figure on this link here</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">well anyway so the house that modernity</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">thank you perfect the idea is so this</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">this house is very big for the planet</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">there are hidden costs on it so so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">the relations between on how this house</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">works there are costs that are not</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">um seen by everyone so both like</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">waste disposal and pollution and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">but also expropriation and violence and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">systemic</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">systemic violence that are perpetuated</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:59.519" style="s2">in a way to live in this comfort zone</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">that we live if we are here sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.519" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">front of each other on the internet we</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">are already</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">in some kind of a better place of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">house right a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">cannot be here uh and then one</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">one of the the drawings that i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:18.399" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting it&#39;s the third one</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">on the first lane um</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">that is talking about the for the false</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">the false promise of social mobility</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">of a universal middle class so we think</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">we are like we are made or we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">taught to to understand that if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">deserve</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">if we do well in our lives and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">we should do hard work</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">we&#39;re going to climb up those stairs</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">right we&#39;re going to be in a better</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">than other generations were so</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">it sort of depends on the individual to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">make its path towards success or</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">something it depends on your</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">autonomy or your ambition and things</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">so we are led to think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">possibility of social mobility for</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">indeed there are stairs inside the house</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">we can see that happening we can prove</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">but the thing is that not everyone fits</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">in the house so a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">the system is designed for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">people to be on the bottom there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">everyone would go to the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">house or to the top of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">and because the ceiling has a limit as</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">you see there</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">not everyone fits there the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work if everyone is in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">system is in the ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">and we have to remember also that</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">there&#39;s always a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">outside of the house so when we think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">modernity as a way of living</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">and modern habits and modern access to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:50.960" style="s2">food medicines uh and other things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">are beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.960" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">not everyone is living this so we sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">of leaving this trans-historical moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">where history is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">aligned for everyone so this already</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">breaks</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">the the view of of modernity itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">the things that usually see things as</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">linear right</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">and things as a common a common thread</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">that unites us all and the thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">time doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">in this linear way there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">people living still</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">nowadays as they used to live a long</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">time ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">and also that&#39;s where we get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">learnings and teachings from and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">still in this third house um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">this division between north and south</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">that is related to the global north and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">global south</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.600" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">of course there&#39;s it&#39;s not a coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">usually it&#39;s it&#39;s connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">geographical</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">division of north and south uh north of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">the planet</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">is a lot more rich than the south of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">but here we bring in uh another</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">ingredients that is saying that in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">north there&#39;s the south of the north</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">so there are in the north of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">people that are excluded and that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">not gaining these benefits of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">of living right so the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">systematically violated and exterminated</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">and still dying for the their lands and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:23.679" style="s2">things like that we know that this</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">exists also on the north</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.679" end="00:19:29.919" style="s2">and also on the other hand the truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">also applies there&#39;s the south there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.919" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">the north of the south</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">so even in the geographical south</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of a lot of rich</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:41.919" style="s2">uh rich people and like a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">privileged</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.919" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">classes and groups of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">mostly like most of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">north so that&#39;s not a linear</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">relation but it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">and most importantly to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">there will always be</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:02.320" style="s2">people outside of this house so</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.320" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">and just trying to repair damages that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">have been done</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">historically usually what we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:12.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:13.520" style="s2">is that this doesn&#39;t work so we see a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.400" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">structured</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.520" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">structural damage happening in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">house so the walls are all</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">broken so we see economical crisis we</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">see climate crisis</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">we see people moving for being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">move from one place to the other so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">conflicts and uh forced migration and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:35.360" style="s2">all of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a big big damage in this house</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.360" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">that modernity</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">built and then we are set with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">question like what should we do then</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">are we gonna fix all these walls are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">extend the house even more but then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">planet doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit this house or should we</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">build other types of house</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">how else can we live what&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">ways of living</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we come and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">usually where we start</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">and to get deep in our courses and our</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">workshops</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">so what are the other ways of living and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">being that we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">try to move towards because we are super</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:15.120" style="s2">limited by the ways of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">so every time that we are thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">we are outside of the box we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">probably just in another box right</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">we go to this other box and then oh now</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">i&#39;m outside of the box now i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">a very different thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">but the consciousness that we try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">bring here</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">is that we are super trapped like deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">in neurology bio neurologically even</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">attached to the strings of modernity so</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">what are the ways that we can do some</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">towards other futures and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">also the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">name of the collective it&#39;s not that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">are going to get there we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">to be you know the colonial future in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">a couple of years or in a generation</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s an intergenerational work</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a work that it should start and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">at some point it will get somewhere we</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">are not sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">where is it where is it but we are sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">that we cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">like stuck in the situation that we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">now that is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">working for most of the people and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">working for the planet either</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">there was a brief scene of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">cool so there are already some</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">uh question here um</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">but maybe i can make a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">small question that before the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">the question and answer part that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">with this the practices of the social</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">cartographies</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">you have a lot of artistic experiments</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">that you engage</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">in in the collective so recently i</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">engaged with one created by danny</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">d&#39;emilia who is one of the researchers</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">who was about the name was the face</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">where we we had like our photos our</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">pictures</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">and we had to make a cut in our face</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">and we have to spend a week taking</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">photos of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:19.120" style="s2">other things in our face so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">kind of art therapies</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.120" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">experiment that for me personally it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">interesting experiment and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s for me it was very interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">in in this the face experiment we start</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">engaging in like liking</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">the ways we are putting we we engage in</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:43.679" style="s2">other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">um like other boxes that is to be liking</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.679" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">the photos you take with the experiments</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">so you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">it&#39;s for me similar to what you were</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">talking about when we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">to even create these exercises we are so</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">trapped</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:59.039" style="s2">in the frames of modernity that we want</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">to you know post the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">the photo that we create so there are a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">lot of you know layers of the straps</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">so my question is about what are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">other experiments</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">and how is this a relation with this</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">artistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:16.720" style="s2">experiments and actually like i know</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.720" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">has been working with art and with</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">museums and um in for many years in your</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">life so</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:31.760" style="s2">what is also your perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">the like art you know what we call art</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.760" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">in this the colonial movement and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">and also in the artistic experiment in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">the collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">yes thank you yeah in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">together with the collective we have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">lot of artists working with us</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m very glad for that because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">not one of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">and and we learn a lot from what they</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">can bring</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">so i&#39;ve always believed in art as a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">of changing the word for instance like</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">last sense but mainly for like taking</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">us out of out of the zone that we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">usually comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">in so out of our current most</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">common kind of thought so yeah i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">working with museums and education</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">in museums and understanding how art can</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">play a role</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">in the shift of paradigm and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">i&#39;m more and more convinced that big</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">institutions are not</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">the way to do that though i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">related to some work in museums which i</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">love but</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they can as a big</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">institution</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">make deep changes so they can like scale</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">things up</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">but they don&#39;t go very deep so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">much more interested now in these</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">pedagogical experiments that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">also in using artistic experiments</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">inside these practices even though</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s for a group of 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">24 people and stuff like that it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">much much smaller scale because it has</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">to be experimental and you have to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:09.520" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">body there and even if it&#39;s online it it</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.520" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">demands</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">a lot of like energy coming together</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">but yeah i think it makes more sense now</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">not to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">to scale it up and with artistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">what i think one that maria mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">uh from the artist danny demilia</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">for example they help us move out</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">of our traditional way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:38.799" style="s2">ourselves and seeing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">as a coherent self as oneself that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.799" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">have to defend and that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">or for example right uh try to be more</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">um to understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">i was also trying to relate with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">question here because</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">usually we see ourselves as very duo as</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">well like either we are doing something</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">good or we are doing something bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">are we in the right path or are we still</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">in the wrong path</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">and this kind of thing so the exercises</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">with art helped me</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">personally in my journey in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">collective as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">learn as a as a learning experience also</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">to detach myself from this fix itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">and difficulty in myself helped me helps</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">understand how i can understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">as a moving thing not as a fixed thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">and then maybe i&#39;m playing with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">lines that are limiting us</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">with modernity um</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve been let me just say something</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">talking about like some critics some</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">strong criticism about modernity</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">right and i just like to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">to make sure we are sort of on the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">page</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">we understand that modernity has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">beneficial things that it brought to us</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.919" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">and we don&#39;t want to neglect that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">and go back old ways to some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">previous ways of living and relating</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about that it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">recognizing everything that modernity</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">brought to us and understanding also</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">how it has been limiting ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">expand</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">to a better in a more possible way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">living futures</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">so acknowledging the contradictions in</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">embracing uh what we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:29.120" style="s2">that is that is good until a certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">kind of limit</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.120" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">and usually the limit would be what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">good and does not affect</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">violently and systemically</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">some other people or the earth</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">cool so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">we can move to the questions we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">already three</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">super interesting questions one that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">already started</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:02.559" style="s2">responding somehow so rain</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:06.159" style="s2">should do they meant do they said right</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.559" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">do you want to talk yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.159" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">um thanks so much for being here</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">and i really liked the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">social cartographies</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">um and like knowledge that moves</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">um instead of being fixed um but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna shift my questions slightly</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">because you kind of answered</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">that dualism um we we deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.200" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">a lot on the stoa so i want to ask how</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">do you differentiate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">from some of the social justice work</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">has become kind of dumb dumbed down</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">um like very ideological and dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:49.919" style="s2">sort of like taking these really</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">important values</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">and uh alienating a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">because of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">kind of simplicity of their arguments</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">and lack of ability to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">how do you differentiate yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">um those kind of unsophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">types of activism</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">yes very very good question and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">reflection for us</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">to do together because</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">a lot of times what happens is that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">try to explain what we&#39;re doing and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">lot of people say wow i&#39;m doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:29.679" style="s2">and my project is this one and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.679" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">really in a different direction right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">one way that we&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:43.679" style="s2">to not to differentiate ourselves but to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">to help everyone to have their own sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">of tools</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">to understand differences between</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">directions</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">so we put we sort of like set things in</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">a system</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">that is through directions and not</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">through fixed like tags this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">project is this and these people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s not fixed attacks it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">where are they moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">so apart from the word that they are</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">using that sometimes is the same word</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">that i&#39;m using and someone the academy</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">is using</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">what is the direction that this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">moving so we are trying to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">that are called that is called the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">raiders uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">so we have now about like 12 raiders</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">uh that we are working on and we always</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">work these on</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">in courses and with other people so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">always enrich and make this process</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">it&#39;s still not very around work</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">but the idea is that everyone should</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">have the tools of raiders</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">to understand what is the direction that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:49.440" style="s2">things are going so am i moving</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">am i moving deep am i going deeper in</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">this question or am i just trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">to a solution</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">this is like one one of the main kinds</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:31:59.039" style="s2">of raiders</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">am i moving forward am i getting just</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.039" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">big and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">going to a resolution to a final answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">am i moving towards something that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">unknown</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">that is dark that is like</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">with no that i have no knowledge exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">but i feel and sense that the direction</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">is deeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">and one other thing very important</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">on how we understand direction</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">is that we are centering we try to or we</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.880" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">wonder we understand that is better</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">to center the earth so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">center of this direction is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:39.600" style="s2">defending</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:43.039" style="s2">one group of people is this defending</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.600" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">the woman is this defending uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.039" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">these people here that is that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">trapped and that need their land back or</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">is this defending the earth</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">as a bigger metabolism that encompasses</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">the woman and this group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">so we try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">to move towards the centering of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">as opposed to being in one single fight</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">with one single</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.840" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">sort of discourse i do understand the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">importance of single fights a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">times you have you are on the front line</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">you are trying to stop something to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">happen and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">you are doing one single fight and i do</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">respect that it&#39;s just not the space</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">that i work on</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">maybe camilla this is also connected to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">outer intensity how do you say that in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">english</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">maybe this is also something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">talk about yeah it took up the high</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">intensity and low intensity struggle</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s an important um cartography also</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">work with is to differentiate um</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">who is in a high intensity struggle than</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">people that are in a low intensity</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">struggle</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">so this is always one one first thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:05.919" style="s2">evaluating uh like a project or</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">trying to analyze what other people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.919" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">we try to understand if they are in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">struggle</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">that their lives depend on</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">so people that needs to fight every day</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">to breathe just to have the right of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">just to be in the land that they are and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">i know canada</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">canada has a big</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:33.359" style="s2">conflict and history also and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">present with a lot of indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.359" end="00:34:37.119" style="s2">there so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">from that sense you can you can relate</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.119" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">to what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:43.919" style="s2">and the difference between those and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">people that are in a low intensity</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">struggle like</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">i struggle with being in this world that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">is so full of problems and i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">do my work here and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">but i don&#39;t i&#39;m not obliged to every day</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:04.079" style="s2">wake up and fight if i if i</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">if i decide to go and work as a waitress</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.079" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">for a year i have this option</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">so if you have an option you were in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">low intensity struggle fight</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very very different place</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">then who doesn&#39;t have this option</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">both because their heart is in</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">in a place that they cannot move out</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">but usually i&#39;m talking more objectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">about people that don&#39;t have this option</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">because their life are at risk at all</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s also a way of uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">calibrating our radars when we see other</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">work happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">um there is also done that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">made some questions and so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">want to speak</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">yes i want to hear you more people</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">yeah let me see if i can find my</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">question here</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:04.480" style="s2">um uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">yes you mentioned earlier camille that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.480" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">that as big institutions can</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">scale as you recognize that big</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">institutions can scale</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">but they may not necessarily change very</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">has the collective explored how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">create and build</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">new institutions from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">if so what has been your experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">thanks yeah no we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">we haven&#39;t worked with creating</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">we are still trying to work on like</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">margins and very</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">small scale projects some of us</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:49.119" style="s2">like individually go back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">institutions and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">feedback that into the work that they do</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">in institutions</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">um there&#39;s this this teacher for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">this professor</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">in the uk sarah she tries to do her work</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">like to connect the work from gtdf back</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">to the university</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s usually a lot of frustration so</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">starting a an institution from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">scratch could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">a way to do it differently i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.200" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s also your other question</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">then about like the vector</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">vectors in the the raiders i think but i</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">maybe camilla had already replied</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">because when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">the raiders i think you you said that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">yeah i think i think she sort of it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">more of a comment</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:53.440" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s not so much about</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">um like a vector it has a direction but</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">it also has a magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">like maybe i just want to take one small</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">step in that direction as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:12.560" style="s2">i want to run a a marathon in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">direction</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s very connected to what</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">you always say camilla of going</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">to deep in the earth like in the soil</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">metaphorically like a mycelium or like</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">and not forward and there&#39;s another uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">question of uh yosho maybe you wanna</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:48.000" style="s2">join and say it or</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">but then i just wanted to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:07.359" style="s2">something first</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">you mentioned uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.359" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">well it&#39;s just in my own words you</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:13.839" style="s2">mentioned so the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">up the rich demographic or population is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.839" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">connected to the land</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">i think you initially said is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">correlated to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">the potential for um</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">um the uh the colonial</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:33.839" style="s2">mindset is that is that what</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">one of the sort of outcomes or findings</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.839" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">yeah there was that i can clarify later</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">so is there is there anything that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">in the digital realm and now especially</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">the way that we&#39;re necessarily detached</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">from land and is there</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">um like it seems to me like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">what you&#39;re referring to by the land is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">also like there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">there&#39;s an inequality to the access to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">various economic resources that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">various populations can have so</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">um but and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">you know now that we&#39;re in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">data driven age and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">you know we&#39;re in these virtual</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">classrooms and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">with everything with covid going on is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">there anything that you&#39;re specifically</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">experimenting with um</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">in the virtual digital realm</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">i think nothing nothing major or nothing</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">like mind-blowing that we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">experiencing the digital realm</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">and i also understand that this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">happening because we are not</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.960" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">very well connected to people that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">um like edge work on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">like people that are being most</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">innovative on that on those areas</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">where we as a collective are not</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">to these people yet so we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">doing the usual on the digital what has</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">been happening</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">different for for us is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:14.480" style="s2">there was a lot of travel involved with</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">a lot of people from the collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.480" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">so a lot of times like someone was away</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:20.560" style="s2">for a month and someone was with an</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">group researching for two months and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">the moments where we were together were</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">little and very precious throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">year and now that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">is back in their homes uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">we we&#39;re going much deeper in developing</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.599" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">own research so we are testing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">pedagogical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">with uh much faster because we have like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">people available and people available</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">so the availability changed a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">not i wouldn&#39;t say we we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">somewhere very different using digital i</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">love to to do that more and</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">thank you there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">one question of peter right</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">you want to join yes um</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">so something he said that caught my</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">attention was</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">kind of the how art is a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:30.880" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:32.560" style="s2">and how kind of this collective is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.880" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">utilizing art to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.560" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">make us aware of the being in the house</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">of modernity and and figuring out ways</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">to go beyond it</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious if you are integrating</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">any conversational like modalities</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">authentic relating modalities and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">dominic barter is coming to mind with</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:49.599" style="s2">restorative circles i know he&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">brazil as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">um because one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:55.599" style="s2">talk here at the star</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">is like trauma accumulated trauma or</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.599" end="00:42:58.800" style="s2">being in the trauma scene</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">and how that kind of prevents people</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.800" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">from deeply connecting</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">and being in right relationship and if</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">you can&#39;t be in right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">another person then it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:08.160" style="s2">hard to be in right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">you know the planet and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.160" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">that&#39;s uh deeply important</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">um so i wondered if there&#39;s that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">personally think there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">to to have art and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">conversations emerge so i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">the collective is thinking anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:26.160" style="s2">with that along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">yeah thank you one of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">models that we were working last year</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">was having different</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">having difficult conversations without</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">relationships falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">so being able to say what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">and without sort of taking it personal</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">and so without making it a fight and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">i would risk saying it sort of inspired</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:53.760" style="s2">in dominic&#39;s work with non-violent</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:54.400" style="s2">communication and all of that i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">familiar</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">uh with his work but no we don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">like specific uh methodologies or</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:09.200" style="s2">restorative circles to do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">because also i think that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">we are addressing a lot the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">so at the same time that we think</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">difficult conversations has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.119" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">without the relationships falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">we understand the limits</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">of the word and of language and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">this limitation is pointed back to us</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">very very directly when we are working</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">with indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s not something we can neglect</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">we&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">we cannot we cannot say everything we</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">cannot put everything on the paper we</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:43.200" style="s2">cannot even draw everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">there are a lot of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.200" end="00:44:47.839" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">so there is a certain movement connected</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.839" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">to art and indigenous knowledge that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not always through dialogue through</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">so there are these two two forces</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">at the same time in the work that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.880" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">been doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">so understanding limits of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">significance and or the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">of the meaning of the of how we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">understand each other in</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">language and how this can be more</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">limitating and suffocating then</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">possible of expanding our limits</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:25.200" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">so i see these two forces at the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.200" end="00:45:28.960" style="s2">time so we try to do some</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">good dialogue but at the same time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.960" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:36.319" style="s2">how we&#39;re gonna move</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">thank you it reminds me also</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.319" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">peter of the a poem that</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:44.079" style="s2">uh that poem from the collective about</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">the violences that are brought sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.079" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">in the dialogues and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">um that is written by i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">a group of indigenous people from canada</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">that maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very like it&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">strong written it&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">it has a feeling connected to it about</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">that is very good to read</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">so there is another question here one is</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">done again</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">asking how to be engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">collective</p>
