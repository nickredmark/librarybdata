<p begin="00:00:00.170" end="00:00:05.940" style="s2">what I want to talk about today is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.000" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">emergence is as a phenomena as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">property that&#39;s actually essential to</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:12.300" style="s2">understand the nature of the universe we</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:14.059" style="s2">live in and it&#39;s actually essential to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.300" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">understand what it means to be human and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.059" end="00:00:19.560" style="s2">that is essential for understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:22.199" style="s2">basis for meaning for ethics for</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.560" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">existentialism and then also what that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.199" end="00:00:25.789" style="s2">portends</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">for the future of civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.789" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">addressing some of the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">concerning and that are exciting okay so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:34.110" style="s2">you can consider the next 20 minutes or</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.759" end="00:00:37.950" style="s2">however long this is as kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.110" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">extemporaneous rambling ode to emergence</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.950" end="00:00:42.930" style="s2">itself right a kind of love talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:44.910" style="s2">how cool it is that universe actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:47.989" style="s2">has this property and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:51.090" style="s2">understand and participate within so</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.989" end="00:00:53.640" style="s2">let&#39;s start by defining what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.090" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">emergence emergence means something new</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.640" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">arises that wasn&#39;t here before</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">all right we all kind of have that sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">intuitively but scientifically how the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2"> does that happen how do you bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">particles or planets or anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">together and all of a sudden the hole</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:09.290" style="s2">has some properties that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">parts had like where do they come from</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.290" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">which is why in in the fields of science</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:17.820" style="s2">that study emergence which evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">theory and biology and systems science</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.820" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">and complexity series study it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">considered the closest thing to magic</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a scientifically kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:27.570" style="s2">admissible term but it&#39;s still sketchy</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.990" style="s2">right in terms of the really</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.570" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">understanding how this thing works and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.990" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">because how do we get fundamentally new</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">things out of relationships of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">where that didn&#39;t exist before this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">fascinating how do you have a cell that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">respirate s-- made up of molecules none</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">of whom respirate and so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">really interesting when you actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">think about this right we we have a coin</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">a paired term does anyone know what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">term is that is key and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">synergy in emergence is synergy synergy</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">and emergence are two sides of the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">phenomena synergy means whole that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">greater than the sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">emergence is what is that greater it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:13.240" style="s2">what is the new stuff that emerges out</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">of bringing things together</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.240" end="00:02:18.700" style="s2">and so synergies more formally defined</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:20.170" style="s2">as properties of whole systems that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.700" end="00:02:21.910" style="s2">aren&#39;t found in any of the parts taken</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.170" end="00:02:24.100" style="s2">separately which also means that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.910" end="00:02:26.500" style="s2">fundamentally unpredicted by the parts</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.100" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">taken separately which portends a future</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.500" end="00:02:30.040" style="s2">that is fundamentally ontologically</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:32.380" style="s2">unpredictable from the current state of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.040" end="00:02:34.510" style="s2">the future which is very different than</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.380" end="00:02:36.580" style="s2">a mechanistic clock unfolding Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.510" end="00:02:38.230" style="s2">understanding of the future and yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.580" end="00:02:39.730" style="s2">still actually makes sense in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.230" end="00:02:42.060" style="s2">scientific laws super interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.730" end="00:02:44.530" style="s2">so synergy is this property of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.060" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">relationship where the whole has new</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.530" end="00:02:50.980" style="s2">properties that the parts didn&#39;t have so</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:53.500" style="s2">emergence is a result of synergy synergy</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.980" end="00:02:57.130" style="s2">as a result of relationship does that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.500" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">make sense and relationship is a result</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.130" end="00:03:01.750" style="s2">of attractive forces there are some</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:03.310" style="s2">kinds of attractive forces whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.750" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">gravity bringing dust together into</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.310" end="00:03:06.880" style="s2">planets or planets the other into solar</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:08.740" style="s2">systems whether it&#39;s electromagnetism</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.880" end="00:03:10.630" style="s2">bringing subatomic particles together</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.740" end="00:03:13.270" style="s2">into atoms or the strong force bringing</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.630" end="00:03:15.340" style="s2">quarks together into protons each of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.270" end="00:03:17.470" style="s2">those are emergent properties driven by</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.340" end="00:03:18.940" style="s2">synergy driven by relationship driven by</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:21.910" style="s2">attraction or whether it&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.940" end="00:03:24.490" style="s2">these people together via pheromones or</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.910" end="00:03:25.660" style="s2">love or intellectual affinity or a topic</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.490" end="00:03:27.220" style="s2">that we&#39;re all interested in like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.660" end="00:03:30.070" style="s2">creating a better world there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.220" end="00:03:33.580" style="s2">attractive forces and so Bucky fuller</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.070" end="00:03:35.350" style="s2">called love metaphysical gravity in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.580" end="00:03:37.330" style="s2">same way that gravity and physical</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.350" end="00:03:39.220" style="s2">forces act on physical bodies to attract</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.330" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">them we have medical physical forces</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.220" end="00:03:44.920" style="s2">that act on metaphysical bodies to drive</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:46.840" style="s2">attraction but think about so imagine if</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.920" end="00:03:48.820" style="s2">you think about all of the attractive</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.840" end="00:03:51.070" style="s2">forces as expressions of a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.820" end="00:03:53.710" style="s2">principle of universe of allurement that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.070" end="00:03:55.990" style="s2">there is a principle by which separate</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.710" end="00:03:57.850" style="s2">things have reason to come together that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.990" end="00:04:00.490" style="s2">offers advantage that being separate</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.850" end="00:04:02.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have and you think about all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.490" end="00:04:04.930" style="s2">the forces of special case applications</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.350" end="00:04:06.880" style="s2">of that imagine if that wasn&#39;t the case</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.930" end="00:04:08.440" style="s2">imagine if we had a universe where</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.880" end="00:04:10.510" style="s2">allurement wasn&#39;t a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.440" end="00:04:13.110" style="s2">principle of it and the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.510" end="00:04:15.670" style="s2">would have stopped at quantum foam right</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.110" end="00:04:16.840" style="s2">you have quantum foam emerge you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.670" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">even quite get to the point of subatomic</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.840" end="00:04:19.900" style="s2">particle and it&#39;s it because nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">attracts to then halves energy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.900" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">emergent properties</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">I have a friend and collaborator Marc</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:28.620" style="s2">Gaffney who calls this Universal love</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">story why at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.620" end="00:04:33.000" style="s2">evolutionary story is this love story</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:34.650" style="s2">which is that it&#39;s actually attraction</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.000" end="00:04:37.320" style="s2">driving the whole evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.650" end="00:04:39.450" style="s2">story right attraction driving</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.320" end="00:04:41.730" style="s2">relationship driving synergy driving new</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.450" end="00:04:43.470" style="s2">emergent properties driving net novelty</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.730" end="00:04:45.060" style="s2">and new creation and the arrow of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.470" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">evolution so we can actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.060" end="00:04:50.310" style="s2">the arrow of evolution itself in terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:51.980" style="s2">of this set of phenomena together does</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.310" end="00:04:55.830" style="s2">that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.980" end="00:04:58.170" style="s2">so then evolution in complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.830" end="00:05:01.080" style="s2">is defined most generally in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.170" end="00:05:02.790" style="s2">more elegantly ordered complexity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.080" end="00:05:05.100" style="s2">actually the best definition we have in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.790" end="00:05:07.170" style="s2">terms of mathematical complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.100" end="00:05:08.760" style="s2">coming out of Santa Fe Institute the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.170" end="00:05:10.230" style="s2">definition has the word elegance built</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.760" end="00:05:11.130" style="s2">right in it because it&#39;s again one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.230" end="00:05:14.220" style="s2">these actually fairly mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">properties but that&#39;s key to it which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.220" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">bringing things together doesn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:20.640" style="s2">you emergent properties bringing them</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.640" end="00:05:24.390" style="s2">ordered way does so think about think</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.160" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">about all the parts that make up a cell</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.390" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got all these nonliving</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:33.330" style="s2">parts DNA and cell nucleus structures</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">and all the different organelles and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.330" end="00:05:38.520" style="s2">cytoplasm and they&#39;re all not living and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:39.900" style="s2">then the cell is living but if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.520" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">brought all those parts together but you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.900" end="00:05:42.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t arrange them as a cell it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:45.090" style="s2">just a bunch of molecules it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.750" end="00:05:47.190" style="s2">that interesting right just be goo if</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.090" end="00:05:48.690" style="s2">you took the 50 trillion cells that made</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.190" end="00:05:52.020" style="s2">you and you didn&#39;t arrange them exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.690" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">this way and you just had like 150</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.020" end="00:05:55.020" style="s2">pounds worth of cells it would be much</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.850" end="00:05:59.790" style="s2">have an order in the complexity where</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.350" end="00:06:02.010" style="s2">the emergent property comes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.790" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">actually the relationship it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.010" end="00:06:05.610" style="s2">heaps coming together it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:07.950" style="s2">complexity it&#39;s holes and the difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.610" end="00:06:10.140" style="s2">between a hole and a heap is order and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.950" end="00:06:11.669" style="s2">specific set of patterns of order this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.140" end="00:06:15.810" style="s2">means not every relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.669" end="00:06:18.810" style="s2">synergistic some relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.810" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">entropic they actually create the</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:25.530" style="s2">properties they destroy some properties</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.290" end="00:06:28.700" style="s2">that were already there right almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.530" end="00:06:28.700" style="s2">everyone has some examples</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:34.759" style="s2">but you can bring chemicals together</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.030" end="00:06:37.400" style="s2">that rather than self-organizing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.759" end="00:06:39.050" style="s2">create higher ordered molecules with new</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.400" end="00:06:40.849" style="s2">thermodynamic properties they have an</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.050" end="00:06:42.469" style="s2">exothermic entropic reaction and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.849" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">drop to lower levels of organization</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.469" end="00:06:47.659" style="s2">right this is true at all levels so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">not just relationship it&#39;s specific</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.659" end="00:06:51.860" style="s2">kinds of relationship that maximize</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:53.530" style="s2">synergy this is a key thing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.860" end="00:06:55.879" style="s2">understand about the nature of universe</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.530" end="00:06:57.889" style="s2">it&#39;s also the case that if you bring the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.879" end="00:06:59.270" style="s2">same thing together a bunch of the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.889" end="00:07:01.190" style="s2">thing you don&#39;t get very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.270" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">synergies you get very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.190" end="00:07:03.139" style="s2">synergies when you bring different</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:05.719" style="s2">things with different properties</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.139" end="00:07:07.190" style="s2">together in the right format where then</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.719" end="00:07:08.539" style="s2">you have the properties of each of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.190" end="00:07:10.069" style="s2">things and then the properties of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.539" end="00:07:11.990" style="s2">relationship between those which is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.069" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">new stuff and you get emergent so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.990" end="00:07:16.009" style="s2">got hydrogen and you&#39;ve got oxygen which</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:17.330" style="s2">are different things and you bring them</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.009" end="00:07:19.490" style="s2">together and you get water in the basis</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.330" end="00:07:22.849" style="s2">for life but neither hydrogen or oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.490" end="00:07:25.490" style="s2">at room temperature or liquids right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.849" end="00:07:27.979" style="s2">so this is a fascinating thing so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.490" end="00:07:29.990" style="s2">actually very interested in having deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.979" end="00:07:33.949" style="s2">synergistic relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.990" end="00:07:37.370" style="s2">differences that lead to fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.949" end="00:07:39.800" style="s2">new emerging properties so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.370" end="00:07:41.419" style="s2">net complexity it&#39;s ordered complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.800" end="00:07:42.949" style="s2">and it&#39;s elegantly ordered complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.419" end="00:07:45.050" style="s2">and then when you get a new property</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.949" end="00:07:46.509" style="s2">then universe selects for that right</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.050" end="00:07:48.979" style="s2">that new property offers some</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.509" end="00:07:50.690" style="s2">evolutionary advantage to that system</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.979" end="00:07:52.759" style="s2">that a system that didn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.690" end="00:07:54.199" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have so things can come</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.759" end="00:07:55.699" style="s2">together all kinds of ways but the ones</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.199" end="00:07:57.860" style="s2">that come together most synergistically</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.699" end="00:07:59.539" style="s2">offer and confer the most advantage and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.860" end="00:08:03.770" style="s2">Universal export so universe is actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.539" end="00:08:05.750" style="s2">selecting for more differences right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.770" end="00:08:08.389" style="s2">it&#39;s selecting for diversity and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.750" end="00:08:10.520" style="s2">more synergistic combinations across</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.389" end="00:08:12.770" style="s2">those differences that and it&#39;s both of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:14.779" style="s2">those more diversity and more</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.770" end="00:08:17.479" style="s2">unification across the diversity right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.779" end="00:08:20.060" style="s2">more agency and more symbiosis at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.479" end="00:08:24.610" style="s2">same time is what defines the era of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.060" end="00:08:24.610" style="s2">evolution does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.620" end="00:08:32.529" style="s2">things that are separate autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.840" end="00:08:34.570" style="s2">agents right so like a cell you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.529" end="00:08:36.490" style="s2">think of as having its own agency right</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.570" end="00:08:38.500" style="s2">its own ability to act and its own</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.490" end="00:08:40.599" style="s2">boundary and periphery but you bring a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.500" end="00:08:42.579" style="s2">bunch of cells together and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.599" end="00:08:44.709" style="s2">collection of cells can reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.579" end="00:08:46.570" style="s2">consciousness and existentialism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.709" end="00:08:48.040" style="s2">have a conversation like this even</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.570" end="00:08:51.579" style="s2">though none of those cells on their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.040" end="00:08:53.079" style="s2">do that right and it&#39;s different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.579" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">of cells you couldn&#39;t do that with just</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.079" end="00:08:57.970" style="s2">neurons it takes neurons and glial cells</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">and immune cells and stem cells etc to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">all come together so more agency more</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:04.930" style="s2">differentiation more orderly</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:06.730" style="s2">relationship more synergy all of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.930" end="00:09:09.610" style="s2">comes together and the net defining</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.730" end="00:09:12.190" style="s2">thing is emergence how much fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.610" end="00:09:15.399" style="s2">new advantage arises and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.190" end="00:09:16.839" style="s2">evolution selects for and so if it</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.399" end="00:09:18.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t for this whole combination of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.839" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">things together is this the message that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.610" end="00:09:27.250" style="s2">says five minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">fascinating so so I I&#39;ll see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.250" end="00:09:33.940" style="s2">go very quickly through that was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:35.769" style="s2">first 1% of what I hoped to discuss so</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.940" end="00:09:38.290" style="s2">I&#39;m going to just skim over the top of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.769" end="00:09:40.329" style="s2">bunch of topics and hopefully paint a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">gestalt at least of an arc that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.329" end="00:09:48.459" style="s2">interesting so the evolutionary universe</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:49.930" style="s2">story the kind of noobest story of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.459" end="00:09:51.490" style="s2">universe we have emerging from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.930" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">intersection of all the sciences is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.490" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">we have an evolutionary universe that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:57.579" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require a creator agent deistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:01.060" style="s2">were theistic God to create but is also</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.579" end="00:10:02.380" style="s2">not just random highly improbable set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.060" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">movements to get us here but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.380" end="00:10:07.000" style="s2">set of properties that give us a</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:13.899" style="s2">is moving towards more elegant ordered</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.890" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">complexity and with that story on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.899" end="00:10:18.699" style="s2">physical you also have the evolution of</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.699" end="00:10:22.449" style="s2">right well as you move from a reptilian</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.730" end="00:10:49.840" style="s2">in a very interesting way and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.890" end="00:10:52.030" style="s2">things that&#39;s so interesting is with our</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.840" end="00:10:54.130" style="s2">capacity for abstraction we cannot just</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.030" end="00:10:55.240" style="s2">think about our experiential self of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.130" end="00:10:56.890" style="s2">moment but we can think about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.240" end="00:10:59.320" style="s2">in abstract terms we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.890" end="00:11:01.990" style="s2">time abstractly deep past and deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.320" end="00:11:04.030" style="s2">future right and that is what allows us</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.990" end="00:11:06.010" style="s2">to actually understand evolution itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.030" end="00:11:08.020" style="s2">it&#39;s an understanding of deep past and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.010" end="00:11:09.940" style="s2">fossil record and astrophysics they give</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.020" end="00:11:12.790" style="s2">us a sense of the ability to abstract</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.790" end="00:11:16.960" style="s2">time that allows us a deeper insight as</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:19.000" style="s2">to how we got here and then also the</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.590" end="00:11:28.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s worthwhile just noting that</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.570" end="00:11:30.190" style="s2">our prefrontal cortex and our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.120" end="00:11:33.160" style="s2">for abstraction is a pretty new</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.160" end="00:11:36.940" style="s2">also very powerful set of capabilities</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.880" end="00:12:07.660" style="s2">in the moment like the other animals and</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.150" end="00:12:23.950" style="s2">universe so if we learn how to use it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.730" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">well then we say how can we learn from</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.950" end="00:12:29.620" style="s2">the past how universe works to be able</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:32.710" style="s2">to imagine a future in an omni</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.620" end="00:12:34.540" style="s2">considerate way that is has</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.210" end="00:12:44.050" style="s2">good and beautiful then how can we apply</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.740" end="00:12:46.180" style="s2">all that learning now to actually help</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.050" end="00:12:49.000" style="s2">create that world and in doing so we</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.380" end="00:13:07.410" style="s2">better but we actually have the</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.410" end="00:13:12.410" style="s2">story is and identifying as well the</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.410" end="00:13:19.260" style="s2">brought me about and then woke up to</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.260" end="00:13:23.490" style="s2">I am actually the evolutionary impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.630" end="00:13:25.079" style="s2">Universal woke to itself in a form that</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.240" end="00:13:44.100" style="s2">cosmos and so we move from evolution as</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.100" end="00:13:49.320" style="s2">that selects for dominance now to a</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.980" end="00:14:04.019" style="s2">make sense so when we don&#39;t identify as</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.250" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">evolutionary&#39;s then we can be actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.019" end="00:14:08.970" style="s2">kind of we identify as nouns rather than</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:11.010" style="s2">verbs and we stay stuck where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.970" end="00:14:12.600" style="s2">and then we need pain as an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.010" end="00:14:15.300" style="s2">driver and then emergence through</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.600" end="00:14:17.370" style="s2">emergency is how we grow as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.300" end="00:14:19.800" style="s2">identify with the inexorability of</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.800" end="00:14:22.890" style="s2">incarnate we stopped needing pain to</p>

<p begin="00:15:09.569" end="00:15:13.220" style="s2">sense because we have a pull driver</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.319" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">because even though you wouldn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.970" end="00:15:57.089" style="s2">in the same way without your brain and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:15:59.790" style="s2">your body you also wouldn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.089" end="00:16:02.069" style="s2">without the atmosphere and the trees</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.790" end="00:16:04.459" style="s2">that make it and the plants and bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.069" end="00:16:06.660" style="s2">that make it and the gravity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.459" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">electromagnetism and foundational forces</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">like the concept of I separate from</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:15.329" style="s2">universe is a misnomer does that make</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:16.889" style="s2">sense so the concept of a life path for</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.329" end="00:16:20.309" style="s2">ourself that isn&#39;t a life path for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.889" end="00:16:22.050" style="s2">universe as a misnomer or advantage for</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.309" end="00:16:25.139" style="s2">self so when so then we get in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.050" end="00:16:26.759" style="s2">deepest sense when Einstein said the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.139" end="00:16:29.569" style="s2">idea that there are separate things is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.759" end="00:16:33.660" style="s2">an optical delusion of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.569" end="00:16:35.689" style="s2">in reality there is one reality that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.660" end="00:16:39.110" style="s2">call universe of which we are all</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.689" end="00:16:42.300" style="s2">inextricably interconnected facets and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.110" end="00:16:44.250" style="s2">your experience of self is a facet of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.300" end="00:16:46.740" style="s2">that now what&#39;s so fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.250" end="00:16:48.389" style="s2">is that it is interconnected with all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.740" end="00:16:49.680" style="s2">it it&#39;s an expression of the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.389" end="00:16:51.660" style="s2">of all of it and it&#39;s also completely</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.680" end="00:16:55.860" style="s2">unique in all of universe it&#39;s a unique</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.660" end="00:16:57.269" style="s2">facet non fungible unique right what</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.860" end="00:16:59.339" style="s2">that means is you have something to</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.269" end="00:17:03.000" style="s2">offer universe in your experience and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.339" end="00:17:05.490" style="s2">your creativity that no one else has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.000" end="00:17:07.530" style="s2">offer exactly that way which means if</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.490" end="00:17:09.500" style="s2">you don&#39;t offer it like if Salvador Dali</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.530" end="00:17:12.990" style="s2">hadn&#39;t done Dali</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.500" end="00:17:14.100" style="s2">Michelangelo didn&#39;t do Dali I sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.990" end="00:17:16.949" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have done Dali Dali just</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.100" end="00:17:19.380" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have happened and so universe</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.949" end="00:17:20.689" style="s2">would have been fundamentally less</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.380" end="00:17:24.900" style="s2">so when you get that your own</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.689" end="00:17:26.490" style="s2">self-actualization is compulsory right</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.900" end="00:17:27.929" style="s2">you have an obligation to it but then</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.490" end="00:17:29.549" style="s2">when you get that everyone else if they</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.929" end="00:17:31.679" style="s2">don&#39;t self actualize universe is less</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.549" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">your participation with helping everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.679" end="00:17:38.059" style="s2">else self actualize is also compulsory</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:40.650" style="s2">so competition is an obsolete concept</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.059" end="00:17:42.030" style="s2">symbiotic to remember universe moves</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.650" end="00:17:44.039" style="s2">towards more differentiation more</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.030" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">novelty and then more symbiosis across</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.039" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">that novelty for more emergence and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">we&#39;re moving towards is a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:55.590" style="s2">where everyone actually identifies this</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:57.780" style="s2">way as a emergent property of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:17:59.880" style="s2">as an interconnected part of universe</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.780" end="00:18:01.260" style="s2">with a unique role to play with unique</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.880" end="00:18:04.200" style="s2">synergies with all the other unique</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.260" end="00:18:06.750" style="s2">roles to play and then with that synergy</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.200" end="00:18:09.030" style="s2">with that human participation then</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.750" end="00:18:10.730" style="s2">humanity actually becomes a thing it</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.030" end="00:18:13.080" style="s2">actually becomes an emergent property</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.730" end="00:18:14.820" style="s2">right now it&#39;s an idea but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.080" end="00:18:18.750" style="s2">humanity we don&#39;t have civilization we</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.820" end="00:18:20.789" style="s2">have humans bumping right it&#39;s we have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.750" end="00:18:22.200" style="s2">bunch of organelles that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.789" end="00:18:24.570" style="s2">organized as a cell that starts</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.200" end="00:18:26.760" style="s2">breathing right you don&#39;t have behavior</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.570" end="00:18:30.210" style="s2">of the whole that is centrally</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.760" end="00:18:32.789" style="s2">unconsciously self-organizing but we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.210" end="00:18:34.230" style="s2">and I would actually say and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.789" end="00:18:36.750" style="s2">what I wanted to have more time to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.230" end="00:18:39.990" style="s2">into but to just foreshadow quickly if</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.750" end="00:18:41.700" style="s2">we cherry pick from the huge data sets</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.990" end="00:18:43.950" style="s2">about where Humanity is going right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.700" end="00:18:45.570" style="s2">we can see that things are exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.950" end="00:18:46.740" style="s2">changing which means changing it more</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.570" end="00:18:48.809" style="s2">and more rapid and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.740" end="00:18:50.220" style="s2">significant rates and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.809" end="00:18:51.780" style="s2">cherry-pick metrics where things are</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.220" end="00:18:53.370" style="s2">getting exponentially better and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.780" end="00:18:54.659" style="s2">true and other things we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.370" end="00:18:57.809" style="s2">exponentially worse and that&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.659" end="00:18:59.190" style="s2">which means the future that you predict</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.809" end="00:19:01.710" style="s2">if you just follow any of those curves</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.190" end="00:19:03.330" style="s2">is not happening if things are getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.710" end="00:19:04.770" style="s2">exponentially better and worse at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.330" end="00:19:05.880" style="s2">same time does everybody kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.770" end="00:19:08.460" style="s2">that that&#39;s happening on different</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.880" end="00:19:09.870" style="s2">metrics then that doesn&#39;t mean things</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.460" end="00:19:13.580" style="s2">are getting better or worse it means the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.870" end="00:19:19.289" style="s2">current system is destabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:21.659" style="s2">and that means self terminating and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.289" end="00:19:23.909" style="s2">we either have a discrete phase shift to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.659" end="00:19:26.280" style="s2">a lower order entropic system or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.909" end="00:19:27.870" style="s2">emergence of a higher order system that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.280" end="00:19:30.210" style="s2">is foundationally different than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.870" end="00:19:33.149" style="s2">current system we have in every in every</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.210" end="00:19:36.299" style="s2">way so the things getting better</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.149" end="00:19:38.549" style="s2">are the pieces that can be reorganized</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.299" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">to create a new civilization with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.549" end="00:19:42.029" style="s2">foundationally new structure right</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:44.759" style="s2">biosphere metrics are getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.029" end="00:19:47.249" style="s2">exponentially worse from misapplication</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.759" end="00:19:48.330" style="s2">of technology technologies right</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.249" end="00:19:49.739" style="s2">application are making things</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.330" end="00:19:51.719" style="s2">fundamentally better but technology is</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.739" end="00:19:54.539" style="s2">giving us the capacity to do things like</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.719" end="00:19:56.460" style="s2">have data analytic capabilities to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.539" end="00:19:58.259" style="s2">inventory all the world&#39;s resources to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.460" end="00:19:59.909" style="s2">then be able to allocate all the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.259" end="00:20:01.320" style="s2">resources to meet all the world&#39;s needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.909" end="00:20:02.909" style="s2">with optimum efficiency we never have</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.320" end="00:20:04.409" style="s2">that ability before like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.909" end="00:20:05.879" style="s2">transportation and communication</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.409" end="00:20:07.529" style="s2">technologies it can actually make us a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.879" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">global civilization we never had that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.529" end="00:20:12.749" style="s2">before right and so the technological</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:15.929" style="s2">capacities that require us to step up</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.749" end="00:20:18.229" style="s2">otherwise we you know self extinctions</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.929" end="00:20:20.429" style="s2">very real thing also make possible a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.229" end="00:20:21.899" style="s2">discrete phase shift and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.429" end="00:20:23.969" style="s2">that&#39;s characterized by three major</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.899" end="00:20:26.179" style="s2">things and this will be where I end at</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.969" end="00:20:28.769" style="s2">the level of social systems primarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.179" end="00:20:32.070" style="s2">economics the key shift we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.769" end="00:20:35.149" style="s2">move to is a moving from a differential</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.070" end="00:20:38.099" style="s2">advantage economy it&#39;s defined by</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.149" end="00:20:40.859" style="s2">private ownership valuation based on</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.099" end="00:20:43.589" style="s2">scarcity and differential advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.859" end="00:20:45.419" style="s2">an economic system that is defined by</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.589" end="00:20:47.129" style="s2">making sure that the incentive of every</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.419" end="00:20:48.839" style="s2">agent and the well-being of every other</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.129" end="00:20:51.149" style="s2">agent and the Commons is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.839" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">aligned with no externality meaning we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.149" end="00:20:54.299" style="s2">actually understand that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.200" end="00:20:56.070" style="s2">interconnected system we identify all</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.299" end="00:20:57.690" style="s2">the externalities and internalize them</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.070" end="00:21:00.239" style="s2">so the system is actually defined by</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.690" end="00:21:02.039" style="s2">systemic advantage for the whole this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.239" end="00:21:03.450" style="s2">not communism or socialism or capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.039" end="00:21:06.089" style="s2">it&#39;s something that was not possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.450" end="00:21:07.950" style="s2">before to even anticipate but it is how</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.089" end="00:21:09.269" style="s2">your body works where none of the cells</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.950" end="00:21:10.440" style="s2">are advantaging themselves at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.269" end="00:21:11.639" style="s2">expense of the other they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.440" end="00:21:13.080" style="s2">what&#39;s best for them what&#39;s best for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.639" end="00:21:18.149" style="s2">whole symbiotically at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.080" end="00:21:19.409" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s the key net shift at</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.149" end="00:21:21.029" style="s2">the level of macroeconomics and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.409" end="00:21:22.379" style="s2">correspondingly governance and all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.029" end="00:21:24.809" style="s2">our social structures at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.379" end="00:21:26.489" style="s2">infrastructure in the built world were</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.809" end="00:21:28.409" style="s2">moving from a linear materials economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.489" end="00:21:30.450" style="s2">where we extract from the earth at</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.409" end="00:21:31.950" style="s2">ever-growing rates unsustainably from</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.450" end="00:21:34.529" style="s2">finite resources and then turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.950" end="00:21:37.080" style="s2">trash to a closed-loop materials economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.529" end="00:21:38.549" style="s2">where the trash is the new stuff we stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.080" end="00:21:40.639" style="s2">extracting from the earth stop producing</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.549" end="00:21:43.349" style="s2">waste and we actually have a post growth</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.639" end="00:21:45.749" style="s2">negative entropy closed-loop materials</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.349" end="00:21:46.310" style="s2">economy where we can live ongoingly at</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.749" end="00:21:47.500" style="s2">progressive</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.310" end="00:21:50.300" style="s2">higher and higher quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.500" end="00:21:52.520" style="s2">sustainably with the biosphere so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.300" end="00:21:53.810" style="s2">the infrastructure shift that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.520" end="00:21:56.090" style="s2">social structure shift and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.810" end="00:22:00.140" style="s2">superstructure the mimetic shift is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.090" end="00:22:02.750" style="s2">awareness of all of us as facets of one</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.140" end="00:22:04.340" style="s2">integrated self evolving reality where</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.230" end="00:22:15.650" style="s2">each other now what&#39;s so interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.310" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">there used to be such a thing as local</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.650" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">problems when Gandhi was working with</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">the home rule for India it was largely</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">in thought of as an Indian problem and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:27.590" style="s2">it didn&#39;t directly affect everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:29.900" style="s2">right when people in the u.s. wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.590" end="00:22:31.340" style="s2">or who founded the US wanted to leave</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.900" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">British Empire there was somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.340" end="00:22:34.100" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:35.270" style="s2">and it was a you know a local problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.100" end="00:22:37.490" style="s2">right now when we deal with species</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.270" end="00:22:39.350" style="s2">extinction and ocean acidification and</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.700" end="00:22:54.410" style="s2">infrastructure and technology is made to</p>
