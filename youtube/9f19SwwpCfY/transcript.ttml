<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">in vermont it got down to like 30 last</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">night so there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">a pretty intense frost uh so i&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:17.119" style="s2">in the sun because</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">basically there&#39;s only a few weeks left</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.119" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">of it and then there&#39;ll be no sun so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.040" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">so getting it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:26.479" style="s2">so so i am going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">run through the final bit of slides as</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.479" end="00:01:30.320" style="s2">promised</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:31.759" style="s2">and then move into probably a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">extended</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.759" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">q a with the hope of bringing some</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.960" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">substantive problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:41.200" style="s2">to the table so not questions about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.200" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">but questions about the world that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">can use the model to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">to grapple with and handle so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">where we&#39;ll be going</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">um let me share my screen here</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">okay so first i&#39;ll just uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">as they say recapitulate so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">roughly on the same page here so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">remember we were working in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">kind of liminal space between the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.720" style="s2">sciences of psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">metaphysics and philosophy and moving</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.720" end="00:02:20.239" style="s2">from charles sanders purse we opened up</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">into this</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">triplicate of metapsychology of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">insolent development</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">these move through different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">stages stations phases and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">relationship between these higher order</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">so we move through installment as you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">recall uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">symbols are not images um</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">and insolent is a process that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">involves the intensification elaboration</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">of image as such we looked at</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:08.080" style="s2">we remember now that development is</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">messy</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.080" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">right the development&#39;s not a simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">ladder it&#39;s not simple growth to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">goodness</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">multiple lines moving through levels</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">and then also webs of development</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">dynamical systems types of phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">with differences between</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">functional and optimal level spreads</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">between different competing growers</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">within the self</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">micro development macro development</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">different time cycles different</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">uh dynamics of interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">so we moved beyond a simple notion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">development and then we kind of like put</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">that in relation to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">notion of installment and now we want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">move into the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">transcendence basically and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">then rap um uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">so you know i started installment with</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">hillman</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">but there could have been other pictures</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">there right there&#39;s other theorists</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">and practitioners of insolent of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">and began development with psja in part</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">just because i had that desk</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">picture just the disorganized desk</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">picture which i picked that psja picture</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">because there could have also been</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">baldwin or</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">or other folks there so i put maslow</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">uh abraham maslow because</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">he touched uh and brought into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">cultural consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">the notion of self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">and transcendent experiences and peak</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">experiences there&#39;s a recent book out by</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">scott barry kaufman</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">just called transcend where he</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">kind of resuscitates some of maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">thinking so it&#39;s a pretty good book i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">not going to speak to but i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">into the room abraham maslow because</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">transcendence not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">in a let&#39;s say simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">uh kind of let&#39;s for lack of a better</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">term buddhistic way</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">right transcendence has a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">to do with uh life as it is lived in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">relationship and in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">than is the normal um</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">kind of connotation of that word and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">maslow with his notions of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">self-transcendence touched across a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">wider spectrum of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">engaging with transcendence as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">modality aside from just like stopping</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">and opening consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">transcending self</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">transcendence as we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">so the triple within the triple dribbles</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.479" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">within triples within triples</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">uh it&#39;s just symbol attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">uh modalities of the modality</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">um and the notion of phases</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">uh so you remember that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">development moved through stages and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">probably these are the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">commonly understood uh of the three</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">um the pgiden stages the goldbergian</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">stages the wilburian stages the spiral</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">stages right so there&#39;s stages</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">stations i introduced as a notion within</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">insolent which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">less well worked up but it has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">worked up</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">and there we saw like pre-tragic tragic</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">post-tragic as a form of stages um</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">excuse me stations</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">um and so phases is is different</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">um so this isn&#39;t phase like he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">through a phase like adolescence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">not what this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">this is phases like in the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">chaos theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">that very complex dynamical systems go</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">phase transitions or phase shifts which</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">move relatively abruptly from one</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say a tractor or basin to another</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">attractor or basin</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the way i like to model</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">of transformation within transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">is you don&#39;t go through stages you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">go through</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">stations you move through</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.960" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">phases and so we&#39;re going to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">and these phases have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">essentially the way consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">constellates around the process of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">symbolization</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">right and so we discussed images at some</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">length and kind of talked about the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">extract universal symbols from within</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">the texture of unique images</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">and when we were in the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:56.160" style="s2">installment i was kind of saying let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">stick with the image</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">and not go off and up into the universal</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">symbol although that&#39;s possible and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">from the perspective of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">the whole point is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">to engage in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">symbolization with</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">life itself to pull everything up and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">the universal self-transcending symbol</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the process of symbolization</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">so precisely from the image you take the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">symbol</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">if you&#39;re working the modality of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">and so this brings us to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">that you find in the work of robert j</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">lifton who&#39;s a fascinating psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">he interviewed uh the survivors of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">hiroshima</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">and he interviewed people who went</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">through uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">communist re-education camps and formal</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">types of brainwashing uh so he was</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">interested in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">extremities of human experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">specifically in the engagement</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">with kind of like unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">technological</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">violence and uh death or annihilation</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">specifically like absurd death or</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">surreal death</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s a lot to say about</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">lifton&#39;s work but this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">uh is one of the things that you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">kind of contribute to the field and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">directly in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">area of transcendence he posited that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">there&#39;s a experience of continuity</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">with life with history and with reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">that is a basic human need that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">some essential process</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">of symbolization during which you</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">from your experience uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">basically draw yourself up and into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">form of symbolic immortality that this</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">is like a like mental hygiene like if</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">you&#39;re doing a good job</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">you should have a rich sense of your own</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">and it happens in different ways like it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">can be through your biological line</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">like for a long time humans had a sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">symbolic immortality by imagining their</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">continuity through</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">ancestry and then into the future of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">part of their their line uh symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">immortality is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">through a sense of having a place in</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">history connection with cultural past</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">noting how your contribution let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">actions or writing will move into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">future of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">culture so you feel symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">connection with the full kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">historicity of human experience and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">the experience of continuity with nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">with consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">um with the universal patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:58.399" style="s2">the cosmos that these things can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">metabolized as part of your psyche</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.399" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">in the modality of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">and the healthy forms of symbolization</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">bring us up and into symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">right now if you have an experience like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:18.399" style="s2">let&#39;s say two world wars</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">and the onset of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.399" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">atomic potential atomic annihilation</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">self-inflicted extinction of the species</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">lift and posits that it uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">disrupts the normal process of imagining</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">your symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:36.460" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to return to this but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.460" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">whereas the soul orients to death you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">recall and i can speak more to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">the transcendent orients to immortality</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">and precisely because the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">cultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">and historical continuity has fractioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">and the sense that the future isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">possible that capitalism can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">its own</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">immortality means that we have cut</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">ourselves off from</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">the sense of continuity with history and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">that our</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">works and actions will survive in</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">perpetuity</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">and so there&#39;s been a retreat towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">those forms of symbolic immortality that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">altered consciousness right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">equate transcendence with</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:22.959" style="s2">altered consciousness which when allows</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">us to experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.959" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">you know thankfully allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">experience continuity with</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">things like nature or reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s a paucity of healthy</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">symbolization</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">around um uh transcendence through</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">civilization history uh life on earth</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">biological life</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">um so there&#39;s kind of three uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.399" style="s2">classic paths this is kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">summation of a lot of the work on</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.399" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">transcendence moving beyond lifton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">work but</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">but including liftman&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">to uh to feel those forms of continuity</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">with life and with history</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.959" style="s2">uh and with reality that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">metabolize and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.959" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">symbolize into our own experience of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">right symbolic mortality as it were um</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">so meditation is the one uh most</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.519" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">i think that says mediation not</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">meditation but that&#39;s so that could be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">typo there</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">um so uh so</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">meditation and theodren&#39;s or you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">drugs for lack of a better term and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">service and care</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">um and so it&#39;s important to get that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">notion of transcendence isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">the one that&#39;s held within the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">meditation traditions</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">um that uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">this does give us that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">continuity with</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">uh let&#39;s say life itself consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">or reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">it also allows us to release the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">kind of identity beyond the skin</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">encapsulated</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">ego which is another property of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">transcendence and actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:09.839" style="s2">often time and other things will float</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">away so the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">being immortal or timeless in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">is possible with meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s not just that and it&#39;s not also</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">strictly speaking related to altered</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">states of consciousness let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">induced through</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">entheogens which also can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">speed up and it and and concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">these processes of symbolization</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">uh and experiences symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">uh but this was one of maslow&#39;s points</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">that many forms of peak experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">and self-transcendence have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">forms of service and care where you</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">find an altar upon which you sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">your ego and through that experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">the transcendence of self and actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">the continuity with life</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">and with history and with the species</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">that are the stuff that allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">to feel through symbolic connection to</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">uh more than yourself to immortality</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">um and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">when you look at the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">anthogens in particular in contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">culture have been hypertrophied as</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">a medium of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">it speaks to the point i raised with</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">lifton about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">lack of ready availability for</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">symbolic immortality which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">if we can&#39;t if we can&#39;t imagine a future</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">for our own civilization</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">and we sometimes can&#39;t even imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">future for the biosphere itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">at least the biosphere as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">then the prospect of attempting to find</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">symbolic immortality by attaching to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">culture or place or nation</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">becomes difficult right</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">and when the information ecology is so</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">fractured that you can&#39;t get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">what those things would even mean like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">what does the united states even mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">who are these guys right when you when</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">figure uh out how to connect you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">substance of your identity</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:34.839" style="s2">to a symbolic structure that&#39;s larger</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">than itself that&#39;s a part of history and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.839" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">then you find transcendence through</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:48.079" style="s2">means which isn&#39;t invalid but it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">a way of uh in the sense of relieving</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.079" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">the construct of identity</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">from its uh responsibility to history</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">and attempting to find transcendence by</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">kind of a radical uh a historical</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">immersion within consciousness as such</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">or reality as</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">such and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">so what you find in in these practices</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">is a couple things one is that uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">massively impactful and valid</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">symbolization processes do take place</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">so like symbolization as lifton</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">describes as i&#39;m working with it here</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">this process of metabolizing experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">into universal symbol which you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">are identified with and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">feeling the sense of immortality</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">that you can get that form of identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:53.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s worth noting there are let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.520" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">endogenous means by which these</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">same forms of transcendence can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">induced</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about meditation later but we</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">can also talk about the other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">peak experiences</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">and so when you think about what we</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">talked about with development</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">and you think about how delicate the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">developmental skill web is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">as it dynamically moves through the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">levels of development</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">you also have to think about the impact</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">of certain practices of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say drugs</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">on development and in soulman right</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">so exogenous forms of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">inducing</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">symbolization may disregulate</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">certain forms of complex skill</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">and complicated installment processes as</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">so you have to think about the full</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">range of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">impact you know when you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">in let&#39;s say um</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:02.640" style="s2">using extreme measures to impact any one</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">of the three modalities</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">right uh and so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">kind of like brief uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">brief overview of these questions so yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">this is a historically uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">you know tons of historical precedent</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">for the use of entheogens</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">in inducing transcendence and symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">but caution</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">so this is a lorenz attractor and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">this is what i&#39;m talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">phase shifts</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">and entheogens are probably the one</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that everyone or</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">many people have experienced where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">like okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">ten minutes later that&#39;s different right</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">uh and it was abrupt and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">you are now in a new world right and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">the same thing happens when you fall</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">into a depressive episode</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh [ __ ] that week went by</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">and now i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">and as wittgenstein says you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">world is different to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">the depressed man</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">and so that notion that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">actually moves through phase shifts</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">uh in a profound manner that affect your</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">to symbolically metabolize your</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">it affects your ability to hold</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">attention and affects the like</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">taste or quality of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">consciousness and then of course that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">propagates through development and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">insulting across the different</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">and so that notion of yes phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">so this is one of those first books that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">came out looking at like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">neuroscientific effects of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">but similar to enthiogens is that notion</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:57.679" style="s2">through a specific kind of practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">engage intentionally not by accident</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.679" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">like with depression or something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">intentionally engaging a phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">in the nature of awareness consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">the symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">so this is the default mode network</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">which is where a lot of convergence is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">happening around</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">neuroscience uh research for mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:23.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">mystical states and altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.520" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">consciousness what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:28.840" style="s2">the default network is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">actually recruiting</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.840" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">uh basically those parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">that have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">your place in time and space</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">so like if you were trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">how to get out of a building</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">and you were imagining all the paths out</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">of the building and where you would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">you recruit the default network uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">anyway so there&#39;s a lot to say about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">the reason i put this in here is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">the other misunderstanding about</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">transcendence is that like you leave</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">your body</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">or something like that or that the body</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">is not important in transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">or but in fact uh as steiner said</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">uh you know heaven is in your bones</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">that transcendent of all the three</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">the transcendent one is in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">location of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">quote unquote embodiment practice right</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:22.559" style="s2">that the transcendent is the body and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">through choice and action you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">remember maybe in the first lecture i</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">talked about the transcendent has having</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">to do with action</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">and choice and actually joining the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">causal</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">unfolding of the universe putting your</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">cause in</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">to the causal unfolding of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">notion where your body hits other bodies</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">and where your body is and takes up</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">space a unique space</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">so that is true meditation is true of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">emphyogens these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">physiological processes that meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">is not a process of leaving your body</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">it is in a fat it is in fact a process</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">of being the body</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">um and so the default network uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">kind of shows that it like so in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">in uh in certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">hypnagogic state etc the way the brain</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">models the body becomes the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">gateway to the quote-unquote experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">of losing</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">the body mind-body drop as they call it</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">in zen</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">delta wave activity</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">eventually dream state etc so these are</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">advanced transcendental meditation</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">2007 that&#39;s a really dope geodesic dome</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">and they are all meditating and they did</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">this for i think some</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">years to attempt to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:53.039" style="s2">violence um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">according to their statistics it worked</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.039" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m not going to go into all of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">but uh it is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:05.940" style="s2">to think about and when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">specifically patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.940" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">behavior in prisons and schools and</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">other places</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that something&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">when you get a groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">engaging in transcendence practices</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:28.240" style="s2">together uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">so again i&#39;m not gonna get into all that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.240" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">of research that needs to be done there</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">because i think that this was something</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">that was very</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">common part of human experience for an</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">extremely long time</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">and now is something that like when</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">people look at this picture there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">reactions one is like oh that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">i&#39;d love to go meditate and the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">one&#39;s like that&#39;s a creepy cult like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a weird creepy cult what are they</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">right and so like that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">we are um</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">uh almost more averse to transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">or kind of fetishizing transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">uh specifically around symbolization and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">then bringing death in with insulin like</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">this is the cluster of problems for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">society that&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">like when freud was writing the clusters</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">of problem that were complicated had to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">do with like sexuality and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">but now the clusters of problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">need to worry about have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">death and symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">that the ubiquitous presence of kind of</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">then you start to have a strange dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">or you will fear them</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:59.039" style="s2">to engage in the transcendent modality</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">is to be in the body but not in a state</p>

<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">but in an engagement uh</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">and so this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:41.679" style="s2">thing to recognize about the human</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">psyche that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.679" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">we experience transcendence right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">not like being on drugs or like</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">meditating it&#39;s a different experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">but we</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">find substance for symbolizing our own</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">you know whenever i speak with someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">who has experienced depression</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:20.160" style="s2">and anxiety i&#39;ll often say uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.160" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">to do service work like it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">best cures</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s finding a way to literally actively</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">engage in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">in caring for others um</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">and so maslow noted this too that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.679" style="s2">was an inordinate number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">had their kind of like peak experiences</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.679" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">like kind of like god consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:46.240" style="s2">in the context of what&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">situation of duress</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">where they are kind of like caring for</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">someone who&#39;s in immediate need</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s just worth noting as an</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">element of transcendence and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">this can be your own work the altar on</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">which you sacrifice yourself can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">your work you can you can find symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">immortality through</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">works that one would be saved through</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">works right that notion like</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">that it is as real an experience in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">psyche as</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">um you know meeting god on dmt</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:24.840" style="s2">or uh having you know pure buddha</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">consciousness through meditation</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.840" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">all right so we&#39;re going to wrap so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.559" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">had these</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">three modalities they went through these</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">kinds of transformations</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">what i want to do here is show that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">these are all related in a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">and in fact it is the case that each of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.279" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">can enfold into the others so let me</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:49.919" style="s2">i mentioned this last time but i want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">deepen it now so</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">if you move through certain stages of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">development you can get to certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">capacities which open</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">certain stations right</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">you move through certain stations you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">can get through you can get into certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">positions that allow for certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">phases of consciousness to change all</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:08.799" style="s2">right so that&#39;s an example of one way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">running it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.799" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to move quickly but i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">you might be able to follow me here</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">similarly</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.559" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">and this is talked about a lot if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">can intentionally induce</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.399" style="s2">phase shifts in your own consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">let&#39;s say if you become a really good</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.399" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">meditator</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">that can open the doorway for more rapid</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">acquisition of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">stage development in skill structure</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">and etc so this becomes a really</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">interesting kind of matrix</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">where you can look at how uh okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">imagine i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">pretty tragic tragic post-tragic right</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">now i became a post-tragic person at a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">young age</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">because some [ __ ] went down so now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">up in post-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">that actually prepares me to have access</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:55.520" style="s2">to certain phase shifts in my</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">consciousness and awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">are unique because i&#39;m all the way up at</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">that station at a young age</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">those phase shifts could allow me to dig</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">into certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">types of skill development right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">that&#39;s so you can start to see how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">can use the model</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">to give different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">of um let&#39;s say advice</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">or it wields different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">self-understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">uh so these are all related i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">going to run through all the iterations</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">um but uh hopefully when i sit down to</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">try to write this thing out i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll start to get some of that going uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:33.919" style="s2">and then again the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">the rotation between them goes in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.919" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">and insolent is root in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">but depending on where you&#39;re at you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">start this rotation</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">at any one of those positions um and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">not going to get into that but you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">imagine for example if someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">already has a deeply developed skill set</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">in a particular area</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">that they took on almost unreflectively</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">as a part of their schooling</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">that&#39;s starting with that highly</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">developed skill set and figuring out a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">way to pull from it</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">some form of meaning into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">transcendence to position then a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">image of the self to re-motivate</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">right so you can move around the circle</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">starting in any position and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">know landry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">metaphysics what you&#39;ll find in here is</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">and i will post this on my</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">website uh so that it will be available</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:42.960" style="s2">um so from here on out it is basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">q a or kind of workshop style</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.960" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">and um you know if there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">are just too conf like so confusing you</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">feel like you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">questions but as i said i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.080" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">an interesting thing to think through</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">would be you know what are some things</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">that are you&#39;re grappling with in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">that you have an inkling like oh what</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:04.799" style="s2">zach just said like that could help me</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">make sense of that what</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">what does that look like to apply the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">model um</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s where i&#39;ll leave it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:12.240" style="s2">then of course next week the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.039" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">will just be</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">will just be open for us to for us to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">thank you zach um so i guess i i&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">to start us off with a question</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:28.159" style="s2">john verbaki talked about neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.159" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">zombie ideology post 2008 just</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">heedlessly moving toward extinction</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">because we&#39;re in the system</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">every day our actions cannot help but</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">supported self-perpetuation</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">my psyche interprets that as a a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">moving moving helping civilization move</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">towards extinction towards death</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">so in what way does our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">with death in the west</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">need to change in order to lay the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">groundwork for a healthier</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">installment</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">yeah i mean it&#39;s interesting right if i</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">run</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">the metapsychology on the culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">uh then what you get is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">obvious over</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">focus on certain forms of technical</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">skill development</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">right like neoliberalism did some [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">extremely well</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">it was just very short-sighted and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">eventually running a self-terminating</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">um but there were certain technical</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">lines of development</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">certain ways of objectifying the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">of extracting raw materials of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">processing the materials</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">global supply chain inter connection</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">just in time</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">shipping so you didn&#39;t have to warehouse</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">and you could just link everything up</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">through getting things there just in</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">time like all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">uh i mean you know come on uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:06.079" style="s2">but then when you look at how is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">relating to the other modalities</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s where it gets a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">actually dark and twisted</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">and i already mentioned lifton&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">you know post-world war ii the culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">of the entire planet was more or less</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">reeling from the shock of existential</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">risk that for the first time we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">unlimited technological violence to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">extent that we could destroy</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">we could wipe biological life from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">from the mantle</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:39.599" style="s2">of the earth and uh and for a brief</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">period of time that was like oh okay the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.599" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">cold wind had mutually assured</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">destruction</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">but you&#39;ll notice now we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">settled into</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">just living with that and a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">began which is to say the normalization</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">of ecocide and impending</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">catastrophic or existential risk the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">normalization of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">required a numbing to the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">of insolent and transcendence so while</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">we were and this is a classic pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">individual development</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">while you&#39;re working really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">build those skills to make a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">neoliberalism you are ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">the ways you are symbolizing your own</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">immortality and you are ignoring the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">images in which you&#39;re trafficking that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">are basically insolent you or bringing</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">you down and into</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">social relationships uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">so in that to that extent it&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">could some of the kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">technological</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">and kind of like skill structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">architecture of neoliberalism have</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">in a container of transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">insolent that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">much more reasonable perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">we would have a working global order or</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:36:59.359" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">like that&#39;s possible right like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:04.560" style="s2">going to survive we need a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:07.920" style="s2">planetary order that actually works</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not self-terminating so how do</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.920" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">you do that is it just a technical</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.839" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">is it that neoliberalism actually was</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">just a technical mistake they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">actually figure out</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">how to you know get the markets balanced</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">and get the right</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">green technologies and that stuff is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">just a technical problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">in the domain of development or is there</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">some dynamic actually of insulin and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">transcendence that humanity must go</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">to balance that skill set um</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s me taking your question kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">of up and into the metapsychological</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">lens but you&#39;ll find in there things</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">come from a bunch of scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">traditions you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">um polanye and habermas you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">said as much the kind of like running</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">wild of objectifying instrumental reason</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">to the deficit of those forms of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">practical</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">uh reason having to do with you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">communicative action</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">and values and things of that nature so</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">there&#39;s many ways to tell that story i</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">just told</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">cool thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.240" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">rob hart has a bunch of questions</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">do you want us to mute yourself sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">i had one question that was more about</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">culture which i</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">i feel like you may have just answered</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:29.040" style="s2">and one that&#39;s more about transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">and meditation for the individual which</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.040" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">would you prefer we</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">whatever you want man um i&#39;m leaning</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">toward culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">actually so i i asked do you see the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">current ascendancy of celebrities and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">political tribes as a collective attempt</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">to treat leaders and tribes as symbols</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">and images of transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">and are we replacing religion and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">mythology with these collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.440" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">if so is there any upside to that is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">sustainable possibly and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">where does it lead psychologically for</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">the individual and for the collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">so celebrity culture is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">best read through that</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">model of something like</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">symbolization so</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">the celebrity lives an image right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">most of our celebrities are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.440" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">uh craft their image</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">right so they&#39;re they&#39;re they seduce you</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">through image creation uh and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">but the but the real punch is in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">the process of symbolization on top of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">that image creation</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">so what you end up having is the cult of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">personality which makes that person</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">more than a person right</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s a deep dynamic which i</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">think when you read it</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">that way when you read it that someone</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">creates basically ritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">creates image positions themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">to be the one who is the stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">metabolize during the process of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">symbolization</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">right to connect your own symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:23.760" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">to a symbol larger than you right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.760" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like an old school</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">psyops that humans have been running</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">since they&#39;ve been creating culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:33.040" style="s2">tribes right</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">um where you you create the image and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.040" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">then you sit in the throne and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:38.880" style="s2">can&#39;t but be</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">symbolized as the king archetype and</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.880" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">then the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">constellates in the dynamic right</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:49.760" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what&#39;s so kind of like uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">that&#39;s why like when rock and roll came</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.760" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">out and people like it&#39;s the devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">music</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">like there is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:58.480" style="s2">strangely</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">captivating at a soul level about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">archetypal constellations that</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">are produced through pop culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">so what that means is that there&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">way more intense cathexis as fredwood</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">said emotional investments specifically</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">of the transcendent type</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">in the celebrity personality which</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">means that the um</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">the well say a few things you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the flip side of that one is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">the equivalent of living god which means</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">if someone plays it right</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">and in adolescence they&#39;re able to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">up and out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">the idealization that they were stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">let&#39;s say of a sports figure</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">they can realize that okay that guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t that ideal</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">right he&#39;s a human he&#39;s a person but</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">this ideal of like someone who</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">works hard and and makes it makes enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">money because he deserves it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">like positive attributes of the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">those things are just hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">and a part of teacherly authority</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">right and so i think this is what many</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">celebrities kind of hope that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">is that they&#39;re allowing kids to see an</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">ideal that they could potentially strive</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">for or something like that but in order</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">for that to work you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">just attach to the ideal from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">human put them back in their unique</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">image with all of its</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">messiness and and not use them as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">symbolizing process or do so consciously</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:32.079" style="s2">so the flip side is that if you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">someone as a superhero when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.079" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">growing up</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">uh and you can mature out of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">adolescent identity crisis and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:40.720" style="s2">take that image and throw it out in</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">front of yourself and move towards it as</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.720" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">your own ideal</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">instead of keeping it embodied in them</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">that could be positive but my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">first of all many of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">people idealize celebrities for are not</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">positive traits</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">and second of all the there&#39;s a ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">on the culture which</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">postpones or actually completely negates</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">the possibility of resolving adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">identity crisis</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">which means that you never get the</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">figure ground shift to pull the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">from the father mother celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">king god ideal superhero thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:23.599" style="s2">and then you end up living resentfully</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">in the shadows</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:29.839" style="s2">of the forms of authority</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">and virtue and capacity you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.839" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">acquire for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a real difficulty in</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">saying that anything that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.560" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">popular culture with the celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">culture is positive</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">i would say mostly they&#39;ve they&#39;ve ended</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:50.800" style="s2">again using really old</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">hardware software of the of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">to create these images for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">symbolization process</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">for you know a very serious soul level</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">and capture of symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:09.200" style="s2">so yeah so i&#39;m not sure if any of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">made sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">but but i think it i think it might be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">junita you had a question</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">and the installment they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">deep timeless structures of the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">i mean you know me this could be my</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">hoc</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:57.839" style="s2">like it seems it seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">um like it&#39;s not in the same stature of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.839" end="00:45:02.520" style="s2">the other two it seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">kind of divergent more of an</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.520" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">epistemological move of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">let&#39;s say like i don&#39;t see them as uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">at the same status and and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">for example um i would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">that so where does insolent the process</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">of installment</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">stop and development begins like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:30.319" style="s2">like um and this is because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking of development as</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.319" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">right and maybe that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">do you understand my question it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like insomnia is timeless</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">and and transcendence is timeless</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">but developmental stage growth</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">is it is it is it also timeless</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">this is an interesting thing totally no</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">i hear what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">uh well a few responses one would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">transcendence is definitely timeless</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t insolent definitely has to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">with temporality</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">um and moves towards okay so let me let</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">me just clarify i don&#39;t mean timeless</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t move but it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">part of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">correct yeah it has development</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">yes you you are describing always been</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">part of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">okay and so then what do we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">development hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">uh no i mean so what i mean by about so</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">and this is where this is why it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">worth putting psja on that slide</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">but you could also look at michael</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">tomasello&#39;s work or anyone who&#39;s looked</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:53.200" style="s2">basically the way the nervous system of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">monkeys and children</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">works with the physical environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">before there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">language or culture or anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">and then when humans are a distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.520" style="s2">cultural species which is to say the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">species-specific trait</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">has to do with a certain form of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:12.480" style="s2">intersubjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">and culture and teaching and learning i</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.480" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:18.160" style="s2">so the model of hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:22.000" style="s2">is a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">useful lens on that process</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.000" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">which humans and animals have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">for as long as they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">trying to operate effectively on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">physical world basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s so that&#39;s not installment for</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:35.200" style="s2">you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">already development that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.200" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">correct yeah i think that&#39;s because my</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">semantic mapping like for me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.240" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">in some installment the process of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">installment but anyways i got</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">that&#39;s so now that makes sense to me but</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">it was more like semantic mapping but</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">very curious about</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">is the layer of image</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">and specifically the image of self</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">and world that&#39;s layered basically on</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">top of or</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">within that developmental engagement</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">with the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">and this is where the you know do</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">animals have souls</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">the animals go through insolent the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:22.720" style="s2">human like so it gets really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">but basically you know when that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">first so the k that&#39;s this is like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">making up like a russoian</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">like fiction of nature when the caveman</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">you know who has figured out how to live</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">with other cavemen and do things</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">start to have an image and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">maybe even begin to share that image</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">among themselves about the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:44.559" style="s2">that activity</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">that they&#39;re participating and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.559" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">when they start to bury one another</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">uh then you start those are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">processes of installment so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">deeply related to development and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:56.000" style="s2">not going to get it without development</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s a different modality of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">psyche and similarly with</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">transcendence like that you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">any of them without the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">and my guess would be that in a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">rudimentary behavior it&#39;s harder to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:10.319" style="s2">piece them apart</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:12.559" style="s2">and the more in cultured and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:14.160" style="s2">civilized we get they can become</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.559" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">fractured and like i said even</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.160" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">for some of the modalities their</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">conversation and reply they can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">repressed</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">their reflection um so yeah i hear you</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">i hear that now that&#39;s very helpful and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">you mean by your terms and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">now i understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">yeah those parameters so yeah awesome</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:36.079" style="s2">and it is we&#39;re saying a lot of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">studied in</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.079" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">developmental psychology is culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">specific learning sequences</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">um and so piaget was attempting to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">at culture universal</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">learning sequences and then tomasello i</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:51.040" style="s2">think really succeeded in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">and his new book just called becoming</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.040" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">human just a theory of ontogeny</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s really really good at getting at</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">this it&#39;s like you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">actual universal</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">stuff of development and it&#39;s not any of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">the particular models that were</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">are super popular like in the integral</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">scene and stuff it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">deeper um kind of structure of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">the nervous system and uh and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.839" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">intersubjectivity actually joint</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">attentional</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">awareness and coordination of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">cool so i&#39;m glad that&#39;s clarified thank</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">you yes thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a private question um</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:30.160" style="s2">can you speak to monogamy versus</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.160" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">in the context of the psyche modalities</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">so many of my friends are abandoning</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">monogamy as a part of moving</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">to a post-capitalist world and yet i see</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">people suffering from limerence</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.000" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">whoa um</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">so this is of course an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">complex question</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">uh so a few things</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">you have to start off by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:10.000" style="s2">the structure of the atomic family</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">and the notions of marriage especially</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:17.359" style="s2">modern legal systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">are kind of messed up</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.359" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">like there&#39;s been a predation</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">that has been made on the family itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">by capital which is to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">possibility of having</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">a healthy nuclear family unit</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">has been made increasingly difficult by</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">the dynamics of capital and of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">as the kind of feminist marxists have</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">demonstrated capital put a particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">burden</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">woman of the house who did all of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">stuff for free</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:55.359" style="s2">that ended up contributing to getting</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:00.000" style="s2">capitalism uh so there&#39;s a dynamic that</p>

<p begin="00:52:00.000" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">emerging from which is i think kind of</p>

<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">unhealthy and so many of us</p>

<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">were raised in households</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">where that was just obvious and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">there&#39;s this sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">marriage just as a bad idea because</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">the whole thing seems to be rigged</p>

<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:34.480" style="s2">legacy all the way back from freud</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">and reich told it in even stronger terms</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.480" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">this legacy of a very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">situation for sexuality itself within</p>

<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">that puts us in a position of basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.800" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">potentially looking back at the history</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:50.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say for the last couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:53.359" style="s2">years of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.240" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">relationships and sexuality and and just</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.359" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">wanting to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">simply critical of it right same thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">can happen with critiques of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">with critiques of the nation state with</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">all that stuff is that it looks so bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">that you can just flip the script</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">well anything like that must be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">what&#39;s new must be something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">different so i actually get that initial</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">which would be to say something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">well monogamy is actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">simply an artifact of the patriarchy in</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">the capitalist world system</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">and that monogamy is entirely a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">construct</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">which has no grounding in any ethical or</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">biological</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">reality so i can imagine constructing</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">for good reason based on near history</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">but i would also say just like we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">simply throw</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">capitalism in the nation-state away</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">or modernity like that there were</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:54.000" style="s2">dignities within modernity</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">uh that we also have to look at what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.000" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">very complicated and here&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">mental psychology becomes</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">important a very complicated process of</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">in particular that&#39;s tied up with</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">love relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">so i&#39;ll say a few things uh and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">first thing i&#39;ll say is that i&#39;m not a</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:22.559" style="s2">uh and uh it&#39;s a grain of salt</p>

<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">became like an essential set of stations</p>

<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">will not be resolved by moving into a</p>

<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:12.880" style="s2">um that the dynamics of</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.839" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">uh so you have to basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">you have to think about not just um</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">has the context in which i&#39;m operating</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">changed you have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">have i changed right</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">so i mean this is like simple advice</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.119" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:56.079" style="s2">there is an unwillingness to engage</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">in the move from the pre-tragic to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.079" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">tragic</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">and then there&#39;s an unwillingness to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:05.520" style="s2">get out of the tragedy and into the post</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">tragic</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.520" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">right so at every time you turn one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">those stations</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep resistance and</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">so it is possible to use</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">uh the relationships you&#39;re in uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">and kind of like fix that make it so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">don&#39;t have to move from</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">pre-tragic to tragic or tragic to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:30.000" style="s2">post-tragic you delay the station&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.000" end="00:57:36.160" style="s2">by rearranging relational dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">sometimes it may be what&#39;s called for</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.160" end="00:57:39.520" style="s2">like i&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">out of relationships</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.520" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">but i am saying that uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">the only forms of polyamory that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">work have been with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">most mature people i&#39;ve ever encountered</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">the people i have found most</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:03.040" style="s2">wanting to engage in polyamory and</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">getting the most damaged by it</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">have been pretty tragic uh immature</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:15.839" style="s2">and so i&#39;m saying it quite bluntly</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.160" end="00:58:17.200" style="s2">but the only way to deepen processes of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.839" end="00:58:20.880" style="s2">installment</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.200" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">is to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.880" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">commitments to others</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">in light of impending death</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">right that the the soul is living to die</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">and the soul isn&#39;t trying to escape</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">commitment and relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">and insolent the soul&#39;s trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:42.640" style="s2">deeper down</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:44.319" style="s2">into the muck of this world</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.640" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not seeking a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.319" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.760" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">through relationship the soul is</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">seeking deepening of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">intensities and obligation and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:59:01.599" style="s2">this is what the soul is doing so</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">you know the the image</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.599" end="00:59:08.319" style="s2">of monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">and the image of polyamory that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.319" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">holding</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">is extremely important and that those</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">images can move</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">through stations and that there needs to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">a sense of what is that core image and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">is it the image that i&#39;m willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:33.040" style="s2">when i die right</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:35.599" style="s2">uh and so it&#39;s at that level</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.040" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">of commitment where human insulin takes</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.599" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:42.880" style="s2">is that me and you till we&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">right like i&#39;m not saying it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">with the partner</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">with now or that needs to even be with a</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:48.319" style="s2">romantic partner</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">but i am saying that that level of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">commitment right to the death me and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:54.720" style="s2">were here</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">together in this together</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.720" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">no matter how bad it gets no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">bad it gets</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m in for the installment</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">process down and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a commitment right and like</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">in the kind of late capitalist context</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">where the family&#39;s been preyed upon</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">they&#39;ve made it impossible to make those</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">kinds of commitments to one another</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">right they&#39;ve undercut the conditions</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.359" end="01:00:20.160" style="s2">for the possibility of that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:21.839" style="s2">commitment at a very basic level for</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">some people</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.839" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">so there&#39;s something extremely radical</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">about being able to make that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:30.480" style="s2">kind of commitment and so the closest</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:34.880" style="s2">thing we have in our culture is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.480" end="01:00:38.960" style="s2">to that is marriage or family um</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.880" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">uh so that so that&#39;s a little bit there</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.960" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">so i&#39;m not giving a strict answer but i</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:45.680" style="s2">am saying that i do know from the level</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">of insulting to get to the post-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.680" end="01:00:50.720" style="s2">you need commitment with others because</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:54.160" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.720" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">deeply co-inhabiting the same image of</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:57.359" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">then you can&#39;t suffer you won&#39;t suffer</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.359" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">with them like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:02.640" style="s2">there needs to be that depth of</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:06.079" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.640" end="01:01:08.760" style="s2">uh and that can be accomplished with a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.079" end="01:01:10.960" style="s2">with you know a non-monogamous structure</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.760" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.960" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">but uh i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">too much immaturity in that in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.920" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">domain to say yeah pursue that</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">like it it is very very difficult and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:28.079" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:30.880" style="s2">um to to find contexts in which you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.079" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">make the commitment of insolent with</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.880" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:36.240" style="s2">so okay now i&#39;m rambling we should</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:37.280" style="s2">switch questions again i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.240" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.280" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">expert so don&#39;t ask me</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">john davis had a question</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.520" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">thank you very much um when i was 12</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:56.720" style="s2">years old i went to the library</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:59.160" style="s2">and i researched homosexuality</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.720" end="01:02:01.440" style="s2">and there was a consensus that</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.160" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">homosexuals</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.440" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">were doomed to prostitution</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">drug addiction that they could not love</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">um church state</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">and science all agreed</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">um and my conclusion was after</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">doing this deep research is</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:29.440" style="s2">that i love jesus</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">and jesus would not do this to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.440" end="01:02:35.839" style="s2">jesus was my first boyfriend</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:35.839" style="s2">and then i</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">and there was a gigantic explosion</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:46.839" style="s2">of renaissance of gay gay culture and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:49.520" style="s2">were in a subculture</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.839" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.520" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">extremely creative and then all of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">sudden the aids epidemic hit</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">and sorry sorry</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">and creating self-help support groups</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:09.920" style="s2">for people with aids</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">and i was uh doing reiki and i was</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.920" end="01:03:14.839" style="s2">touching people</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">every day hours a day who were suffering</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.839" end="01:03:20.880" style="s2">profoundly and i asked the question</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:25.680" style="s2">very consciously does human love</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.880" end="01:03:25.680" style="s2">transcend death that was a big</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:35.760" style="s2">and i got some answers very direct and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.960" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">very destabilizing also because there</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:40.480" style="s2">was hardly anyone</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:43.520" style="s2">that i could really um</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.480" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">direct my inquiry to um</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.520" end="01:03:49.039" style="s2">but now i&#39;m in this situation covet</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:51.599" style="s2">uh which is very similar to the aids</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.039" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">epidemic except in many ways it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">easier for me</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:57.839" style="s2">i&#39;m much older now than was in my</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">twenties when the aids hit</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.839" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">and my question now is or my desired</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">outcome i have a desire</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">i want to co-create</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.440" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">people who will have solved</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:21.839" style="s2">the problems that we cannot solve</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">so uh and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.839" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">i do i think that&#39;s possible and i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:28.079" style="s2">it&#39;s desirable</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:30.480" style="s2">that we can create the conditions for</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.079" end="01:04:32.559" style="s2">that future people</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.480" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">but we have to use our imaginations to</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.559" end="01:04:36.160" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very good big commitment so i</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.160" end="01:04:40.319" style="s2">hope there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">a useful question that&#39;s going to come</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.319" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">out of this inquiry and i just</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.039" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">contexts uh but i&#39;ve been a caregiver</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">um for my wife for about seven years now</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">who suffered a terrible iatrogenic</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">brain injury um from</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:48.400" style="s2">a pharmaceutical drug and so that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">right at the end as i was finishing my</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.400" end="01:06:52.880" style="s2">dissertation</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:55.920" style="s2">um megan was stricken basically</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.880" end="01:06:58.480" style="s2">bedridden and non-verbal uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.920" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">for a couple of years uh doctors</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.480" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">couldn&#39;t explain it</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:02.559" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to explain it because it</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">happened from a pharmaceutical drug and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.559" end="01:07:06.640" style="s2">so i was her sole caregiver for that</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:08.880" style="s2">time and she&#39;s still recovering there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">been kind of a miraculous recovery</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.880" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">uh but very very slow very very painful</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">so it was in that context and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:21.920" style="s2">specifically the transformations of my</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:25.760" style="s2">image of self and other in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.920" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">that had that pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.760" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">too tragic than to post tragic and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:35.039" style="s2">with the post-tragic isn&#39;t like oh now</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:35.039" style="s2">the tragedy&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh now i know how to live</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:44.240" style="s2">burning in tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">and so it was in fact uh being</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.240" end="01:07:49.839" style="s2">overwhelmed by tragedy at one point</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.799" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">uh as it hit as it became clear a couple</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.839" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">years in that</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:57.520" style="s2">how devastating the whole thing was</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:08:00.799" style="s2">um that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.520" end="01:08:04.240" style="s2">uh transformation of again</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">image um and the two-part process the</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.240" end="01:08:08.480" style="s2">transformation of image allows for</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.160" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">if it&#39;s working right more symbolization</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:12.319" style="s2">of symbolic immortality so i had to find</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">a way to metabolize</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.319" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">and this is why the alchemists talk</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">about the kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.520" end="01:08:20.560" style="s2">container in which you do this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:22.319" style="s2">dangerous alchemical transformative work</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.560" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">so i had to find a way to metabolize the</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.319" end="01:08:26.799" style="s2">intensity of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">tragedy into new image and into new</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:30.759" style="s2">forms of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:32.480" style="s2">symbolic immortality this is me</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.759" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">retrospectively</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.480" end="01:08:36.839" style="s2">talking about what happened which during</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">the time was uh of course</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.839" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">um just you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:44.960" style="s2">uh what it was and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:45.440" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s what that that was</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.960" end="01:08:48.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.440" end="01:08:52.319" style="s2">you know um megan</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.799" end="01:08:55.839" style="s2">continues to recover uh and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.319" end="01:08:58.880" style="s2">by far the strongest person that i know</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.839" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">um haven&#39;t given what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.880" end="01:09:03.040" style="s2">given what she&#39;s been through and so you</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.759" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">know that deep in the sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.040" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">tragic and the post-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">and it with that sense also the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">ontological reality of love</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">you know that it is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:18.719" style="s2">force akin to a force of nature</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:20.239" style="s2">and that when you are in a tragically</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">constellated situation</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.239" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s real like you</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:26.560" style="s2">can punch it</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:29.759" style="s2">so real is the bond of love</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.560" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">um and so as painful as it was</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.759" end="01:09:35.759" style="s2">you know the intensity and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:37.279" style="s2">and the depth of the experience of love</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.759" end="01:09:40.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.279" end="01:09:42.960" style="s2">was it was was part of that process so</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.400" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very personal sharing and like</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.960" end="01:09:46.880" style="s2">i said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">i did one podcast where i talked about</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.880" end="01:09:50.080" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:51.199" style="s2">and talked about the development of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.080" end="01:09:54.960" style="s2">crying practice</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.199" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">that i developed as a way to engage with</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.960" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">the transforming transforming image</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">of the tragedy that i was in because i</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">found that there were certain</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">images which is to say certain ways of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.320" end="01:10:09.840" style="s2">representing what i was living in</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">that were so difficult</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:14.719" style="s2">that i was wasting energy pushing them</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.560" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">out of my awareness</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.719" end="01:10:20.480" style="s2">i was trying not to see the actual</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">insolent situation that i was in</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.480" end="01:10:23.920" style="s2">and uh i began working with his body</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:26.320" style="s2">worker and</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.920" end="01:10:28.320" style="s2">broke some stuff open and then began a</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.320" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">crying practice in which i</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.320" end="01:10:35.520" style="s2">and again back to the alchemical imagery</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:38.560" style="s2">i allowed the unbearable image to emerge</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.520" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">uh and so i became able to bear the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">unbearable image</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:43.199" style="s2">which is that notion of burning in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">tragedy it&#39;s not resolving</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.199" end="01:10:47.120" style="s2">tragedy or fixing the tragedy which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:48.800" style="s2">what everyone wants to do by the way if</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.120" end="01:10:50.000" style="s2">someone&#39;s sick they want to fix it even</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:51.199" style="s2">if they have no idea what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.000" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">they&#39;re like let me fix it you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.199" end="01:10:54.719" style="s2">you can&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:56.239" style="s2">you can&#39;t fix it it&#39;s a [ __ ] it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.719" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.239" end="01:11:02.800" style="s2">uh so that sense of allowing</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:06.239" style="s2">through tears and again embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.800" end="01:11:07.040" style="s2">the unbearable image to be born in your</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:10.560" style="s2">psyche</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.040" end="01:11:12.640" style="s2">uh that was really what got me through</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.560" end="01:11:14.159" style="s2">and into the post-tragic was that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.640" end="01:11:17.199" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.159" end="01:11:18.159" style="s2">allow the full depth of the tragic</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.199" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">imagery</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.159" end="01:11:23.360" style="s2">to emerge</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:24.960" style="s2">and then to allow the physiological</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.360" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">process of encountering that image to</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.960" end="01:11:28.400" style="s2">unfold which</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">in this case was just intense intense</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.400" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">grief</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">and so the processing of it up and</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">was critical if i hadn&#39;t figured out how</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.960" end="01:11:38.560" style="s2">to do that i don&#39;t know what would have</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:41.199" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.560" end="01:11:43.440" style="s2">and so you know when you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.199" end="01:11:44.719" style="s2">ensoment and stuff and this is why</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.440" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">you know the relationship thing that was</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.719" end="01:11:49.360" style="s2">already mentioned is so key like</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s intense like in soulman is not</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.360" end="01:11:53.360" style="s2">something you do</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.320" end="01:11:53.760" style="s2">like in a peaceful meditation retreat</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.360" end="01:11:56.080" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.760" end="01:11:57.360" style="s2">organic food and stuff like insomnia is</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">like tears</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.360" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">and snot and crying</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.640" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.120" end="01:12:10.880" style="s2">yelling and um</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">pleading with god and a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.880" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.600" end="01:12:16.480" style="s2">that is very real to the human</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:19.520" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.480" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">and and not like i think you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.520" end="01:12:22.000" style="s2">megan&#39;s situation was extreme this was</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">extreme</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.000" end="01:12:30.239" style="s2">tragedy but all human experience has</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:33.440" style="s2">tragedy if you can undo the numbness</p>

<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:12:58.159" style="s2">um david sweden you had an easy question</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.400" end="01:13:06.880" style="s2">that&#39;s cruel all right hey zach um</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:06.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:13.280" style="s2">um let me frame it this way one of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.840" end="01:13:14.960" style="s2">symbols i asked a question about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.280" end="01:13:19.040" style="s2">symbol the symbol of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.960" end="01:13:22.560" style="s2">um mushroom cloud</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.040" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">is the transcendent possibly the</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.560" end="01:13:28.880" style="s2">transcendent bridge</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:32.080" style="s2">between collective developmental stage</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.880" end="01:13:34.400" style="s2">to a collective ensolment stage</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.080" end="01:13:35.679" style="s2">something of a and and the image is</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.400" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">powerful for me</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.679" end="01:13:39.600" style="s2">um from multiple perspectives but one</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">thing of um</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.600" end="01:13:42.960" style="s2">in my own kind of movement through this</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:46.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.960" end="01:13:46.719" style="s2">the sense of plato&#39;s cave is an</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.080" end="01:13:50.080" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.719" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">emers emerging from plato&#39;s cave</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.080" end="01:13:57.679" style="s2">i think is symbolic of a neuron firing</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">right it&#39;s like an a neuron holds on to</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.679" end="01:14:01.120" style="s2">the shadows on the internal wall of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.520" end="01:14:03.440" style="s2">neuron trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.120" end="01:14:04.239" style="s2">maintain sense of what&#39;s happening until</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.440" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.239" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">anymore and must fire and when it fires</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:10.000" style="s2">it releases the electric storage of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.719" end="01:14:13.120" style="s2">chemical energy into</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.000" end="01:14:14.960" style="s2">the into the network to get a new echo</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.120" end="01:14:16.159" style="s2">of what&#39;s possible emerging from the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.960" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">cave and returning</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.159" end="01:14:19.840" style="s2">back to the cave with a new a fresh</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.480" end="01:14:23.600" style="s2">image of what</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.840" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">new embodiment new insolent looks like</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.600" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">and so that and that and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.440" end="01:14:29.360" style="s2">transitional movement</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:31.280" style="s2">from human beings when we go through</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.360" end="01:14:35.120" style="s2">deep developmental stage</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.280" end="01:14:35.600" style="s2">shifts like adolescence or something</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.120" end="01:14:36.880" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.600" end="01:14:38.640" style="s2">i think is like that and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.880" end="01:14:40.800" style="s2">collectively</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.640" end="01:14:42.960" style="s2">i see the same thing possible for us as</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.800" end="01:14:46.480" style="s2">human beings right is that so this</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.960" end="01:14:49.440" style="s2">in a sense that that phoenix story of</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.480" end="01:14:51.440" style="s2">crashing with all of the all of the last</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.440" end="01:14:53.120" style="s2">straw that collapses the structure that</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.440" end="01:14:56.400" style="s2">can no longer hold</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.120" end="01:14:59.360" style="s2">the tension of experience and must</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.400" end="01:15:02.880" style="s2">dissolve and re-pattern in a new</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:04.640" style="s2">emergent way to to start the cycle over</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.880" end="01:15:08.239" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.640" end="01:15:09.280" style="s2">so in thinking about that it seems that</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.239" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">that the emergence of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.080" end="01:15:19.840" style="s2">in our cognitive frame of doing this</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.199" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">is a kind of neuronal firing like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.840" end="01:15:25.760" style="s2">in gaia&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:26.640" style="s2">that this cognitive frame that we have</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.760" end="01:15:30.080" style="s2">is a is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.640" end="01:15:31.280" style="s2">is a new thing which is tragic in one</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.080" end="01:15:34.400" style="s2">sense it&#39;s the death</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.280" end="01:15:36.480" style="s2">of the old model which we</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.400" end="01:15:38.480" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have happen the grief and</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.480" end="01:15:39.920" style="s2">suffering of that and yet the emergence</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.480" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">of something</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.920" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">new so it feels kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:53.520" style="s2">um the possibility of something like</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:54.480" style="s2">a new cambrian explosion of a different</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.520" end="01:15:59.120" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.480" end="01:16:00.560" style="s2">of mind infusing matter at another layer</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.120" end="01:16:02.719" style="s2">that&#39;s a big question like i said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.560" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">not easy but the sense of that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.719" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">that cycle happening at various scales</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">along the fractal</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.760" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s something like a</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:14.159" style="s2">self-awareness as we</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:16.239" style="s2">see our collective in the mirror</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.159" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">through the internet it&#39;s like oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.239" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">who are we</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:23.280" style="s2">and the last grips of trying to hold on</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">to who we thought we were</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.280" end="01:16:26.480" style="s2">it feels like we&#39;re on the edge of that</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:28.560" style="s2">damn bursting</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.480" end="01:16:30.480" style="s2">and letting go of who we thought we were</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.560" end="01:16:32.880" style="s2">does that</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.480" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">fit in with there&#39;s some definitely some</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.880" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">interesting stuff in there</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:40.640" style="s2">like two things i&#39;ll pull out one</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:41.920" style="s2">the image of the mushroom cloud and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.640" end="01:16:44.960" style="s2">image of the mushroom cloud</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.920" end="01:16:49.440" style="s2">and the image of the earth from space</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.960" end="01:16:51.199" style="s2">about roughly historically right so</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.440" end="01:16:53.120" style="s2">and that notion of the image of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.199" end="01:16:54.880" style="s2">earth from space like that was</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.120" end="01:16:57.679" style="s2">mind-blowing when that dropped</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.880" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">on the culture um and then at the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.679" end="01:17:00.480" style="s2">time the image of the mushroom bomb</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.040" end="01:17:01.840" style="s2">roughly which is saying like we could</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.480" end="01:17:04.640" style="s2">blow the whole thing up</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.840" end="01:17:05.440" style="s2">that those emerged roughly the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.640" end="01:17:09.440" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.440" end="01:17:10.400" style="s2">uh post world war ii uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.440" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.400" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">interesting there like i speak about</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:14.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:17.280" style="s2">this process of planetization kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.960" end="01:17:18.960" style="s2">echoing tilian de chardon</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.280" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">and the notion of the new sphere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.960" end="01:17:22.080" style="s2">just kind of bringing to mind your</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.239" end="01:17:24.159" style="s2">notion which is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.080" end="01:17:26.880" style="s2">perhaps there&#39;s a particular historical</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.159" end="01:17:27.679" style="s2">epoch during which time the species kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.880" end="01:17:30.159" style="s2">of actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.679" end="01:17:31.120" style="s2">planetizes and at that time it would</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.159" end="01:17:32.640" style="s2">have both</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.120" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">total awareness of its planetary</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.640" end="01:17:36.640" style="s2">situation and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:38.560" style="s2">the existential ability to end the</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.640" end="01:17:41.760" style="s2">planetary situation</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.560" end="01:17:44.400" style="s2">and that that would be something like</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.760" end="01:17:46.560" style="s2">late adolescence realizing that oh my</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.400" end="01:17:48.960" style="s2">god i&#39;m a mortal human</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.560" end="01:17:50.480" style="s2">i could die hopefully which is again one</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.960" end="01:17:52.640" style="s2">of the resolutions of the adolescent</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.480" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">identity complex right is</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.640" end="01:17:56.800" style="s2">realizing you&#39;re gonna die um so that</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:17:58.719" style="s2">there&#39;s something like a shift that</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.800" end="01:18:00.159" style="s2">we&#39;re in currently which is at the level</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.719" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.159" end="01:18:05.040" style="s2">the resolving or not of the adolescent</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:06.000" style="s2">identity crisis right and so you could</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.040" end="01:18:08.159" style="s2">also just</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.000" end="01:18:09.040" style="s2">continue an increasingly risky behavior</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.159" end="01:18:12.080" style="s2">as an adolescent</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.040" end="01:18:14.640" style="s2">instead of resolving the crisis</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.080" end="01:18:15.199" style="s2">and maybe end up self-terminating right</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.640" end="01:18:16.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.199" end="01:18:18.239" style="s2">yeah so there is something there those</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.800" end="01:18:19.760" style="s2">two images emerging kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.239" end="01:18:21.520" style="s2">reconstituting the human</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.760" end="01:18:23.440" style="s2">psyche demanding that it has</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.520" end="01:18:26.000" style="s2">self-awareness of its situation kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.440" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">as an adult species responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.000" end="01:18:29.600" style="s2">its host planet um and then the question</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:30.880" style="s2">of whether</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.600" end="01:18:34.480" style="s2">the internet&#39;s the thing that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.880" end="01:18:34.480" style="s2">be the global brain</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.800" end="01:18:42.880" style="s2">if it is right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.159" end="01:18:44.320" style="s2">psychotic having a panic attack looking</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.880" end="01:18:46.960" style="s2">at pornography</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.320" end="01:18:49.040" style="s2">um and so there&#39;s a way in which the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.960" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">internet as we know it now</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.040" end="01:18:52.800" style="s2">uh certainly is not the internet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:54.080" style="s2">going to be the thing that allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.800" end="01:18:56.960" style="s2">resolve the adolescent identity</p>

<p begin="01:18:56.960" end="01:18:59.600" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.159" end="01:19:02.719" style="s2">where i&#39;m putting a lot of my attention</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.600" end="01:19:03.760" style="s2">is fixing the informational ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.719" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">that we all</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.760" end="01:19:07.199" style="s2">live within so after that moment of</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:08.719" style="s2">self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.199" end="01:19:10.719" style="s2">like the adolescent a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.719" end="01:19:12.400" style="s2">free prefrontal cortex comes on you have</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.719" end="01:19:14.080" style="s2">a longer time arounds and you can take</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.400" end="01:19:16.560" style="s2">more perspectives as that lesson</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.080" end="01:19:17.679" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the most confusing times of</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.560" end="01:19:20.719" style="s2">your entire life</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.679" end="01:19:21.120" style="s2">um so there is kind of a lot of noise in</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.120" end="01:19:25.360" style="s2">system right now culturally and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:27.679" style="s2">question of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.360" end="01:19:29.600" style="s2">what are the things that are the</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.679" end="01:19:32.719" style="s2">maturational</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.600" end="01:19:34.159" style="s2">challenges that we resolve or don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.719" end="01:19:36.159" style="s2">think is</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.159" end="01:19:40.159" style="s2">is key so thank you for all that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:43.360" style="s2">some really interesting stuff in there</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.159" end="01:19:43.360" style="s2">time for a couple more maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.560" end="01:19:48.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a dearth of questions in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.920" end="01:19:49.520" style="s2">chat so um feel free to ask some more</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.400" end="01:19:52.800" style="s2">questions everybody i</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.520" end="01:19:55.760" style="s2">i have one more to relay us</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.800" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">um can you show us some concrete utopian</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.760" end="01:20:01.360" style="s2">theorizing</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:20:01.360" style="s2">on planet scale rites of passage</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.840" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.760" end="01:20:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s crazy uh well a few things so one</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.760" end="01:20:16.960" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.440" end="01:20:16.960" style="s2">what i was just describing now</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:21.280" style="s2">was kind of a little bit of a planetary</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:24.480" style="s2">scale right of passage</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.280" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">that the acquisition of you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.480" end="01:20:27.199" style="s2">basically unlimited technological</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:30.639" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.199" end="01:20:31.679" style="s2">um and the ability to understand the</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.639" end="01:20:34.719" style="s2">earth system</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.679" end="01:20:37.120" style="s2">has an earth system uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.719" end="01:20:39.040" style="s2">both suggest a threshold event at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.120" end="01:20:42.080" style="s2">level of the collective psyche</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.040" end="01:20:45.679" style="s2">um and so i would actually say that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.080" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">you know we are currently</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.679" end="01:20:49.199" style="s2">in a situation of having basically</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:52.239" style="s2">postponed</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.199" end="01:20:54.320" style="s2">confronting that rite of passage</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:55.360" style="s2">so it was like we were put in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.320" end="01:20:58.560" style="s2">situation of saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.360" end="01:21:01.360" style="s2">hey human species you really need to get</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.560" end="01:21:02.800" style="s2">mature extremely quickly</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.360" end="01:21:05.440" style="s2">because of all the stuff that you just</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.800" end="01:21:08.159" style="s2">built in the situation that has unfolded</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.440" end="01:21:08.639" style="s2">uh and instead of saying wow i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.159" end="01:21:10.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.639" end="01:21:12.400" style="s2">take a vision quest for a week and come</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.320" end="01:21:15.120" style="s2">back like a new person</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.400" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">with a spirit name and ready to take on</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.120" end="01:21:19.760" style="s2">responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:21.120" style="s2">um uh instead they were like cool man</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.760" end="01:21:24.000" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna keep playing</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.120" end="01:21:24.960" style="s2">video games and stacking these papers uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.000" end="01:21:28.239" style="s2">and that was</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.960" end="01:21:29.280" style="s2">not the correct thing uh so this</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.239" end="01:21:32.719" style="s2">question of</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.280" end="01:21:37.280" style="s2">would it be possible to actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.719" end="01:21:39.440" style="s2">uh orchestrate something like a</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.280" end="01:21:41.280" style="s2">you know intentionally arranged or</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.440" end="01:21:44.080" style="s2">planetary level</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.280" end="01:21:45.600" style="s2">right of passage where we could become</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.080" end="01:21:48.719" style="s2">more mature</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.600" end="01:21:50.080" style="s2">um you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.719" end="01:21:51.920" style="s2">one part of me that says well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.080" end="01:21:54.800" style="s2">this is inevitable</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.920" end="01:21:56.880" style="s2">like you don&#39;t have to arrange it and in</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.800" end="01:21:59.040" style="s2">fact any group attempting to arrange a</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.880" end="01:22:00.960" style="s2">planetary scale anything right now</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.040" end="01:22:02.320" style="s2">is probably one of the problems if those</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.960" end="01:22:05.440" style="s2">groups exist</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.320" end="01:22:08.239" style="s2">um which is to say like imagine</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.440" end="01:22:09.199" style="s2">a pandemic spreading across the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.239" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.199" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">you know became something like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:15.600" style="s2">rite of passage for the entire planetary</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.639" end="01:22:18.000" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.600" end="01:22:19.440" style="s2">right like if if you don&#39;t plan that</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.000" end="01:22:21.280" style="s2">kind of thing and if you are planning</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.440" end="01:22:24.320" style="s2">that kind of thing this is a huge</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.280" end="01:22:26.639" style="s2">problem so</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.320" end="01:22:27.679" style="s2">so what i&#39;m saying is that the rite of</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.639" end="01:22:31.280" style="s2">passage is</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.679" end="01:22:34.159" style="s2">coming if not happening that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.280" end="01:22:35.760" style="s2">intentionally designed that if it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.159" end="01:22:37.199" style="s2">intentionally designed then it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.760" end="01:22:40.480" style="s2">right of passing the right of</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.199" end="01:22:43.600" style="s2">rite of passage that if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.480" end="01:22:45.920" style="s2">try to arrange for tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:48.480" style="s2">in order to move into the post-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.920" end="01:22:50.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not a real tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.480" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">this is why the problem with ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.000" end="01:22:52.159" style="s2">trips and all these things it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">you want to move</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.159" end="01:22:55.440" style="s2">into the post tragic you have to engage</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:57.280" style="s2">in actual tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.440" end="01:22:58.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t arrange for a tragedy to</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.280" end="01:23:02.080" style="s2">happen because you made it happen</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.800" end="01:23:05.120" style="s2">you&#39;re controlling it uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.080" end="01:23:08.159" style="s2">so the rite of passage for the human</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.120" end="01:23:11.199" style="s2">species has probably been unfolding for</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.159" end="01:23:12.080" style="s2">some time the concrete utopian</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.199" end="01:23:14.320" style="s2">suggestion</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.080" end="01:23:17.040" style="s2">is the one i always make which is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.320" end="01:23:20.000" style="s2">we need educational resources</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.040" end="01:23:21.920" style="s2">that are robust enough to allow us to</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:25.120" style="s2">address this moment</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.920" end="01:23:30.560" style="s2">of passage which is to say like</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.120" end="01:23:32.320" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s possible that um</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.560" end="01:23:35.840" style="s2">getting a lot of weird feedback here are</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.320" end="01:23:35.840" style="s2">those other people getting that</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.719" end="01:23:43.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what that is nope stopped</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.239" end="01:23:43.920" style="s2">sorry so</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.159" end="01:23:48.320" style="s2">okay that that weird noise basically was</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.800" end="01:23:49.440" style="s2">a sign for me to stop answering that</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.320" end="01:23:54.320" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.440" end="01:23:54.320" style="s2">um so one more question</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.560" end="01:24:02.080" style="s2">all right sam c had one question</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.600" end="01:24:05.440" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.080" end="01:24:09.040" style="s2">hi zach um</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.440" end="01:24:12.639" style="s2">the way i phrased my question and i</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.040" end="01:24:15.679" style="s2">sent it to you let me see</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.639" end="01:24:18.719" style="s2">um i don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.679" end="01:24:20.000" style="s2">why you say that soul is oriented to</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.719" end="01:24:23.679" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.000" end="01:24:26.800" style="s2">is the acorn attracted to the stump</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.679" end="01:24:29.520" style="s2">or the full canopy robust tree and you</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.800" end="01:24:32.000" style="s2">get the image right the acorn theory of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.520" end="01:24:35.280" style="s2">insolent from hillman</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.000" end="01:24:38.560" style="s2">and how i understand the model</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.280" end="01:24:41.440" style="s2">on a personal level is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.560" end="01:24:43.199" style="s2">you get on a quest for installment right</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.440" end="01:24:46.400" style="s2">for the image you&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.199" end="01:24:49.920" style="s2">with and that</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.400" end="01:24:52.800" style="s2">image gives you the motivation</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.920" end="01:24:54.159" style="s2">to build skills and get on the</p>

<p begin="01:25:04.639" end="01:25:11.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s how i understand it and i see</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.320" end="01:25:12.320" style="s2">this image the soul as an aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.840" end="01:25:15.440" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.320" end="01:25:16.400" style="s2">reiki with corbin called the divine</p>

<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:31.280" style="s2">of yourself of self-improvement but</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.239" end="01:25:34.719" style="s2">what what what i said before about</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.280" end="01:25:37.520" style="s2">this image and when i hear you</p>

<p begin="01:25:50.600" end="01:25:55.679" style="s2">annihilation</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.840" end="01:25:59.199" style="s2">of the self like how can i um</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.679" end="01:26:02.320" style="s2">make peace with with with what i see</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.199" end="01:26:05.920" style="s2">and the attraction you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.320" end="01:26:07.120" style="s2">do you follow me yeah totally</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.920" end="01:26:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.120" end="01:26:12.480" style="s2">right hillman&#39;s acorn theory</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.520" end="01:26:13.120" style="s2">the metaphor perhaps falls short there</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.480" end="01:26:14.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.120" end="01:26:17.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s also from hillman that i</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.560" end="01:26:22.080" style="s2">get the notion that the soul</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.120" end="01:26:24.560" style="s2">um images itself in relation to death uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.080" end="01:26:26.400" style="s2">this is also hillman&#39;s notion and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.560" end="01:26:27.440" style="s2">the way i understand it is basically</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.400" end="01:26:31.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.440" end="01:26:33.520" style="s2">uh well it&#39;s essentially a reframing</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.520" end="01:26:37.600" style="s2">viewer of what you said it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.520" end="01:26:40.880" style="s2">attempting to say something like um</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.600" end="01:26:44.239" style="s2">you are living towards your death</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.880" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">that the death is in fact the telos</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.239" end="01:26:50.480" style="s2">of life the death is in the problem</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:52.639" style="s2">that the soul came here to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.480" end="01:26:55.600" style="s2">the right way to die</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.639" end="01:26:58.000" style="s2">um and so like to move into like</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.600" end="01:27:00.880" style="s2">mythopoetic language like</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.000" end="01:27:01.600" style="s2">why would you come here if it wasn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.880" end="01:27:05.040" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.600" end="01:27:06.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens here like if souls</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.040" end="01:27:07.760" style="s2">are in some other realm where death</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.320" end="01:27:09.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist they just stay there they</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.760" end="01:27:11.600" style="s2">can do tons of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.040" end="01:27:12.159" style="s2">the whole unique thing about being here</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.600" end="01:27:15.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.159" end="01:27:17.679" style="s2">limitation and death</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.920" end="01:27:20.159" style="s2">and that image that you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.679" end="01:27:22.080" style="s2">towards it&#39;s an image of your life</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.159" end="01:27:25.440" style="s2">but it is in fact something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.080" end="01:27:27.120" style="s2">trying to kind of like do before you die</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.440" end="01:27:28.560" style="s2">right you&#39;re trying to fulfill this</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.120" end="01:27:29.440" style="s2">image you&#39;re trying to step into this</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.560" end="01:27:31.280" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.440" end="01:27:32.560" style="s2">and the limiting factor and the thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.280" end="01:27:34.239" style="s2">that drives</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.560" end="01:27:37.040" style="s2">a lot of pathological archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.239" end="01:27:38.880" style="s2">expression is that limiting factor</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.040" end="01:27:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s that notion that there&#39;s only so</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.880" end="01:27:44.239" style="s2">much time here</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.880" end="01:27:46.239" style="s2">that soul is a temporal insolment is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.239" end="01:27:50.320" style="s2">temporal process of</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.239" end="01:27:55.600" style="s2">moving down into the world</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.320" end="01:27:55.600" style="s2">and in essence becoming</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.639" end="01:28:04.159" style="s2">preoccupied with the</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.480" end="01:28:05.920" style="s2">the finitude of it the finitude of it</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.159" end="01:28:07.920" style="s2">that and this is what&#39;s different about</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.920" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">the experience of insulin the experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.920" end="01:28:11.600" style="s2">of transcendence that</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:13.520" style="s2">in the experience of transcendence you</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.600" end="01:28:15.920" style="s2">move from your experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.520" end="01:28:17.440" style="s2">up and out of the world into like a</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.920" end="01:28:20.239" style="s2">liberated universal</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.440" end="01:28:21.120" style="s2">experience right in installment you</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.239" end="01:28:24.159" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.120" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">like you know this mug</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.159" end="01:28:30.560" style="s2">right this mug my dad&#39;s mug right</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:32.639" style="s2">this is a particular unique mug</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.560" end="01:28:34.639" style="s2">there&#39;s like heart strings attached to</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.639" end="01:28:35.520" style="s2">this mug this isn&#39;t a universal symbol</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.639" end="01:28:38.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.520" end="01:28:38.719" style="s2">the like chalice that held the blood of</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.320" end="01:28:42.560" style="s2">christ</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.719" end="01:28:44.560" style="s2">no no this is my dad&#39;s mug right</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.560" end="01:28:45.920" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the experience of insomnia</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.560" end="01:28:49.280" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a deepening</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.920" end="01:28:50.960" style="s2">of entanglement the feeling the</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.280" end="01:28:53.679" style="s2">poignancy</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.960" end="01:28:54.320" style="s2">of the uniqueness of the image that</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.679" end="01:28:56.800" style="s2">you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.320" end="01:29:00.080" style="s2">which is to say that there will never be</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.800" end="01:29:04.239" style="s2">another image like this image</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.080" end="01:29:07.360" style="s2">that it is inimitable</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.239" end="01:29:09.360" style="s2">and cannot be replaced</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.360" end="01:29:11.280" style="s2">cannot be substituted or swapped out</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.360" end="01:29:14.480" style="s2">under a common symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.280" end="01:29:15.679" style="s2">umbrella right so that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.480" end="01:29:19.360" style="s2">notion of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.679" end="01:29:22.560" style="s2">my death that my soul is preparing for</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.360" end="01:29:25.920" style="s2">uh you know zach stuff</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.560" end="01:29:27.840" style="s2">very unique experience which needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.920" end="01:29:31.199" style="s2">constellated</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.840" end="01:29:31.840" style="s2">through this image to feel like the life</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.199" end="01:29:34.960" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.840" end="01:29:36.239" style="s2">worthwhile that it made sense um</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.960" end="01:29:38.000" style="s2">not that i found a way to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.239" end="01:29:40.960" style="s2">transcendent within life</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.000" end="01:29:43.199" style="s2">but that the lived life experience was</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.960" end="01:29:46.159" style="s2">had the full potency of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.199" end="01:29:47.520" style="s2">that the unique self was expressed and</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.159" end="01:29:49.920" style="s2">death is the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.520" end="01:29:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s kind of the forcing function</p>

<p begin="01:29:51.120" end="01:29:54.400" style="s2">the the main source for this is actually</p>

<p begin="01:30:06.800" end="01:30:13.120" style="s2">and that suicide is</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.920" end="01:30:14.260" style="s2">something like the soul&#39;s demand to see</p>
