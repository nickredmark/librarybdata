<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:10.769" style="s2">shawarma how college moving in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.890" end="00:00:13.820" style="s2">new programs the doubting miss state</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.769" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">what would what&#39;s your personal hope</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.820" end="00:00:18.990" style="s2">that you would like to see here I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">it&#39;s very important that we get the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.990" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">right land-use here that&#39;s consistent</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">with the insights that we&#39;ve been given</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">in which we&#39;re developing I don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">mean around the grounds of the college</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">but I mean over the whole estate because</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:35.850" style="s2">the land is primary I mean the tribal</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">indigenous people have taught us that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.850" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">that the land is where all we or</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">goodness comes from and at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">we&#39;re treating our land very very badly</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">we&#39;re farming it intensively and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">sure I would like to see Schumer has</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:52.370" style="s2">influence extend out to change the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">farming practice towards more</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.370" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">permaculture ish ways of farming or</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">dealing with the land but I also I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:03.750" style="s2">she apology or Dartington as a whole has</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">the potential to of becoming a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.750" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">important Green University where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">exploring everything that a conventional</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:13.950" style="s2">University explores but from a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">logical perspective they&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.950" end="00:01:18.619" style="s2">buildings here we&#39;ve got the potential</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:21.990" style="s2">here what we need of course is a demand</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.619" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">from the general public but we have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">potential to become a very important</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">perhaps the world&#39;s first Green</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">University so that would mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">departments well though it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:35.100" style="s2">separate departments that we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:39.409" style="s2">working on green economics green</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.100" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">agriculture health care Deep Ecology</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.409" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">land use practices all of which are</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:47.399" style="s2">deeply ecological and that&#39;s the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">becomes more more serious as and as</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.399" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">people understand how serious the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">is more more people want to come and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">study in a place like this so did you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">see and the estate turning into both a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">green University but also like an an eco</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">village or yes I think the two would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">inseparable hmm and University it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:09.849" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be the right word either means</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:11.950" style="s2">visual works on the old</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.849" end="00:02:14.379" style="s2">from the old paradigm we aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.950" end="00:02:16.030" style="s2">appropriate because there wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.379" end="00:02:17.109" style="s2">clear distinctions between departments</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.030" end="00:02:19.780" style="s2">like there is there wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.109" end="00:02:21.790" style="s2">department as there are in conventional</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.780" end="00:02:24.219" style="s2">universities people with multitasking</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.790" end="00:02:26.439" style="s2">doing different sorts of things the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.219" end="00:02:28.209" style="s2">learning would be very experienced there</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.439" end="00:02:32.230" style="s2">would be a theoretical component but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.209" end="00:02:35.230" style="s2">also be embodied through all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.230" end="00:02:36.639" style="s2">practices out in the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.230" end="00:02:39.099" style="s2">community would be very much involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.639" end="00:02:41.739" style="s2">too so there&#39;s great potential for</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.099" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">developing that here I also think there</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.739" end="00:02:46.079" style="s2">should be a and lots of colleges or</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:48.159" style="s2">places like this around the world and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.079" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">sure how college could be sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.159" end="00:02:53.829" style="s2">mothership for all those institutions or</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:58.569" style="s2">all those places that are needed in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.829" end="00:03:00.819" style="s2">every continent to some extent that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.569" end="00:03:02.980" style="s2">already being developed through an Gaia</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.819" end="00:03:06.040" style="s2">education and the global eco village</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.980" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">Network and yes with a very much like</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.040" end="00:03:12.730" style="s2">you described curriculum that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:15.579" style="s2">holistic experiential teaching and links</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.730" end="00:03:17.530" style="s2">into local communities do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.579" end="00:03:21.069" style="s2">there might be a place to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.530" end="00:03:23.019" style="s2">collaborate with yes sure we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.069" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">explored that very much hmmm and when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.019" end="00:03:26.409" style="s2">say issue my college is the monk</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.989" style="s2">mothership well it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.409" end="00:03:30.519" style="s2">yeah at all you know it&#39;s not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.989" end="00:03:32.650" style="s2">we could be one under the places where</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.519" end="00:03:35.229" style="s2">this happens what we can offer here is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.650" end="00:03:38.229" style="s2">quite a strong theoretical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.229" end="00:03:41.620" style="s2">of holistic science economics or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.229" end="00:03:44.019" style="s2">whole area in ecological thinking and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.620" end="00:03:46.389" style="s2">need to expand now to to make ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.019" end="00:03:48.099" style="s2">more practically based but I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.389" end="00:03:51.549" style="s2">there are many other places that can</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.099" end="00:03:54.599" style="s2">offer that deeper theoretical intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.549" end="00:03:57.129" style="s2">and intellectual understanding of both</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.599" end="00:04:01.180" style="s2">the reasons for the cause of crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.129" end="00:04:02.859" style="s2">its solutions which is this through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.180" end="00:04:06.039" style="s2">extended faculty like all the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.859" end="00:04:08.709" style="s2">that could come and teach you are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.039" end="00:04:11.259" style="s2">hoping to develop the and the an actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.709" end="00:04:12.849" style="s2">resident faculty of people that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.259" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">could deliver that kind of well on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.849" end="00:04:16.889" style="s2">short time no</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:19.109" style="s2">happened in the long-term it all depends</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.889" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">on how much demand there is so what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.109" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">do hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">so it could expand in that sense but at</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:25.370" style="s2">the moment we&#39;re not thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">expanding the faculty hmm very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.370" end="00:04:30.030" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking of starting a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:33.330" style="s2">master&#39;s degree in something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.030" end="00:04:35.880" style="s2">ecological design hmm but other than</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.330" end="00:04:39.900" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to have a certificate</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.880" end="00:04:41.880" style="s2">program in holistic education but other</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.900" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">than that no I mean there&#39;s no plans to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.880" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">make it here hire lots of new faculty</p>
