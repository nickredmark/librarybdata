<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:06.569" style="s2">analyst invited me to speak a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.550" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">about the rising regeneration movement</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.569" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">around the world or what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">regeneration rising I think that all of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">us alive today are challenged in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">lifetimes to redesign the human impact</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">on earth to fundamentally change our</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:31.949" style="s2">ways to become healers of a wounded</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:34.620" style="s2">planet that we wounded and to do what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.949" end="00:00:37.079" style="s2">can to turn this runaway climate change</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.620" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">around it turns into cataclysmic climate</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.079" end="00:00:43.469" style="s2">change and the good news is that this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">happening all over the world and one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.469" end="00:00:47.670" style="s2">the core principles of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">development is it starts with personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">development so I&#39;m gonna echo a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:56.969" style="s2">what has already been said rex mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">a lot of wonderful things that stay</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">active like we by the power of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">attention and the power of our intention</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">we shape this world there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.650" style="s2">we cannot like that we do or don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t affect the whole that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.650" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">a part of so just a loving attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:19.320" style="s2">towards trying to be part of the healing</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">rather than part of the destruction of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.320" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">Mother Earth is already making a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:27.240" style="s2">difference and so it is an internal it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">is a spiritual path it is a personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.240" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">development path but it&#39;s also a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:36.930" style="s2">practical path out there and for example</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:38.850" style="s2">Paul Hawkens object drawdown has listed</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">a hundred ways that we can draw carbon</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.850" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">out of the atmosphere already right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">and there is a global movement on</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">regenerative agriculture that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">changing how we grow our food in ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">that farmers become guardians of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">ecosystems health and there&#39;s a global</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">more academic and policy driven movement</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:02.430" style="s2">around planetary health I&#39;ve wrote my</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">PhD in 2006 on designed for human and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.430" end="00:02:05.969" style="s2">Planetary health and was really</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:08.849" style="s2">surprised when because initially nobody</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.969" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">wanted to know about it and in 2017 the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.849" end="00:02:13.069" style="s2">Rockefeller Foundation and The Lancet</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.349" style="s2">the key Medical Journal</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.069" end="00:02:17.629" style="s2">published a report on planetary health</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.349" end="00:02:19.999" style="s2">and for all of you out there this could</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.629" end="00:02:22.849" style="s2">be just like the SDGs with all their</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.999" end="00:02:24.950" style="s2">flaws are an invitation and a platform</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.849" end="00:02:28.310" style="s2">for a conversation we need to have right</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.950" end="00:02:31.010" style="s2">now also about their flaws in a similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.310" end="00:02:32.389" style="s2">way this planetary health concept which</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.010" end="00:02:34.430" style="s2">is already a hundred and twenty</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.389" end="00:02:36.170" style="s2">universities and government policy think</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.430" end="00:02:39.919" style="s2">tanks lined up around the planet is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.170" end="00:02:43.459" style="s2">key entry point for us to work on all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.919" end="00:02:47.090" style="s2">this I see a confluence on the planet as</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.459" end="00:02:48.709" style="s2">we see the converging tri-c&#39;s of Fricke</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.090" end="00:02:50.209" style="s2">of capella mentor said if you follow the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.709" end="00:02:52.909" style="s2">ecological the economic and the social</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.209" end="00:02:55.010" style="s2">crisis upstream you meet the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.909" end="00:02:59.359" style="s2">consciousness a crisis of perception in</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.010" end="00:03:01.459" style="s2">a similar way if you as as the crises</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.359" end="00:03:04.519" style="s2">are converging the solutions and those</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.459" end="00:03:07.340" style="s2">trying to heal the planet are converging</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.519" end="00:03:09.099" style="s2">and confluence in like like rivers</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.340" end="00:03:12.139" style="s2">meeting and for me these are the river</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.099" end="00:03:14.719" style="s2">planetary health everything regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.139" end="00:03:16.969" style="s2">we&#39;ve mentioned the fundamental need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.719" end="00:03:19.669" style="s2">redesign our economic system is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.969" end="00:03:21.500" style="s2">degenerative dysfunctional system and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.669" end="00:03:23.359" style="s2">there are people working on that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.500" end="00:03:25.790" style="s2">capital institute has published a paper</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.359" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">on what would regenerative capitalism or</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.790" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">regenerative economy look like just a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.579" style="s2">couple of days ago they&#39;ve published a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">paper of how what would regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.579" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">finance look like and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.979" style="s2">people like the region network and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:43.099" style="s2">working on new technologies that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.979" end="00:03:45.609" style="s2">provide the proof of regeneration of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.099" end="00:03:48.919" style="s2">ecosystems so people can invest in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.609" end="00:03:51.229" style="s2">regeneration of ecosystems there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.919" end="00:03:53.930" style="s2">wonderful work going on in education the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.229" end="00:03:56.750" style="s2">earth wise center higher education guy</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.930" end="00:03:58.819" style="s2">university the permaculture movement the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.750" end="00:04:01.370" style="s2">holistic land management movement so</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.819" end="00:04:04.040" style="s2">many people coming together and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.370" end="00:04:05.780" style="s2">deep wisdom in the the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.040" end="00:04:09.289" style="s2">development process developed by our</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.780" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">genesis group and and i&#39;m really excited</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.289" end="00:04:14.150" style="s2">to see all these things coming together</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:16.849" style="s2">and for those who are interested i gave</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.150" end="00:04:19.130" style="s2">a talk on this at finn home post the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.849" end="00:04:25.219" style="s2">link and so you just get all the links</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.130" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">and yeah so somebody said earlier when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.219" end="00:04:28.710" style="s2">loved how</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:31.050" style="s2">brother Phil described how after all</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.710" end="00:04:32.940" style="s2">these years of science we finally</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.050" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">figured out that it&#39;s all connected and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.940" end="00:04:39.690" style="s2">it&#39;s all interrelated and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:42.419" style="s2">intelligent and this is the strapline of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.690" end="00:04:44.220" style="s2">pioneers who&#39;ve done good work and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.419" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">trying to bridge this gap between</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:50.460" style="s2">indigenous knowledge and modern science</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">and innovative exploration of ecological</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.460" end="00:04:56.070" style="s2">designers and engineers for decades now</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:57.630" style="s2">and so our movement is not a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.070" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">movement our movement is a movement that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.630" end="00:05:02.820" style="s2">is as old as the climate change problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:06.300" style="s2">and actually an ancient movement if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.820" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">finally reconnect with the wisdom that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.300" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">indigenous cultures have to share to us</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:14.699" style="s2">and as we stand up and do something</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:18.180" style="s2">about this we do so with the power and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.699" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">authority of 3.8 billion years of life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.180" end="00:05:24.449" style="s2">evolution it is life speaking through us</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:27.960" style="s2">saying enough we have done enough damage</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.449" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">we now need to make a difference and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.960" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">know in this is it it is local but it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:35.849" style="s2">glocal it is both local and global</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:38.820" style="s2">because we need to do the action in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.849" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">place in our bio bio region but we also</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.820" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">need to keep connected to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.830" end="00:05:47.389" style="s2">each other and to keep this awareness</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:49.620" style="s2">that everything we do everywhere is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.389" end="00:05:52.199" style="s2">contributing to the healing of the</p>
