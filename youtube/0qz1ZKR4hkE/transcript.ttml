<p begin="00:00:32.780" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">So let’s take a look at the structure of<br />paradise as it’s presented in Genesis.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">So the first aspect of the initial paradaisal<br />state is un-selfconsciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:50.739" style="s2">Now if you look and factor analytic studies<br />of human personality you note that self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.739" end="00:00:56.390" style="s2">although it is arguably our greatest gift<br />also loads almost entirely on the factor that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.390" end="00:00:58.030" style="s2">defines negative affect.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.030" end="00:01:03.649" style="s2">And you might also notice that when you say,<br />I became self-conscious you generally put</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.649" end="00:01:07.990" style="s2">a negative cast on that in that I was talking<br />before a group of people and suddenly I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.990" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">seized by self-consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">And as a consequence of that I was flooded<br />by negative emotion and was fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:15.580" style="s2">immobilized.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.580" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">So it’s a very paradoxical, a very paradoxical<br />state of being, our highest rational gift</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:29.140" style="s2">say, and the only on that clearly distinguishes<br />us from animals is also that which, when manifested,</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.140" end="00:01:32.119" style="s2">makes us almost unbearable anxious</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.119" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">The initial paradaisal state when Adam and<br />Eve first walked in the Garden of Eden is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">characterized by an animal-like unselfconsciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">Adam and Eve, whatever they are, are not clearly<br />segregated from the rest of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:49.159" style="s2">They have no idea, for example, of their own<br />nakedness.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.159" end="00:01:53.619" style="s2">And if you think about what nakedness means,<br />you immediately understand that that’s also</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.619" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">a very profound, dramatic representation.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:02.200" style="s2">You know with children around the age of 3<br />or 4, many of them regardless of their mode</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.200" end="00:02:07.430" style="s2">of upbringing, start to become very concerned<br />about privacy, say with regard to bodily functions</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.430" end="00:02:11.560" style="s2">and also very concerned about ever showing<br />themselves without clothing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.560" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">and it’s perfectly reasonable to presume<br />that that’s a consequence of their emergent</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:22.790" style="s2">self-consciousness, an event that takes place<br />somewhere between the ages of 2 and 5 and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.790" end="00:02:27.660" style="s2">that’s a defining moment that makes them<br />segregatable, say from their mother.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.660" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">And so you also have images of Paradise that<br />flow through Western history that are characterized</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:39.810" style="s2">by the image of the unconscious union between<br />the mother and child</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.810" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">which is an imagistic representation that<br />eradicates the tension of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">both for the mother and for the child.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:55.209" style="s2">So the notion that the child is living in<br />a paradaisal condition that is somehow lost</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.209" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">as he or she approaches adulthood gives another<br />sort of symbolic layer to the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">pre-selfconscious paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:07.430" style="s2">It’s also a place where order and chaos<br />are in perfect balance</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.430" end="00:03:14.930" style="s2">and you know that because what paradise means<br />is para – around, daisa – a wall, while</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.930" end="00:03:19.129" style="s2">Eden means delight or a place of delight.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.129" end="00:03:23.940" style="s2">Paradaisa, paradise is a walled garden, a<br />walled place of delight</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:29.610" style="s2">and a garden is precisely that place where<br />the forces of nature or chaos and the forces</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.610" end="00:03:32.670" style="s2">of culture are held in perfect balance, right?</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.670" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">That’s what a garden is.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:38.830" style="s2">It’s nature given form by culture and it’s<br />a place that’s archetypically pleasant a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.830" end="00:03:44.630" style="s2">place where the intervention of human activity<br />has produced a kind of stability that transcends</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.630" end="00:03:50.689" style="s2">that of nature because it’s a cultural construct<br />but also that transcends that of culture because</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.689" end="00:03:55.860" style="s2">all of the plants and the other growing things<br />that constitute a garden are somehow transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.860" end="00:04:03.829" style="s2">even though they’re under the cultivating<br />hand of culture and the individual.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.829" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">If you look at the manner in which the fall<br />story is represented, you can also see that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">the place of craziest stability can be regarded<br />as a kind of paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">So if you remember the story of Moses leading<br />his people through the desert, it’s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:22.640" style="s2">the case that when the Israelites were in<br />the desert, even though they got away from</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.640" end="00:04:27.860" style="s2">the tyranny it was easy to look back and say<br />well you know, tough as it was, the place</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.860" end="00:04:31.240" style="s2">that we were before was much better than the<br />place we are now.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.240" end="00:04:37.181" style="s2">So it’s perfectly reasonable and expectable<br />for people who are caught in a crisis to look</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.181" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">back to the time prior to the dawn of that<br />crisis with longing even if the crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:47.900" style="s2">they’re presently experiencing is a necessary<br />precondition for further development of personality.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.900" end="00:04:53.770" style="s2">So the story that’s laid out in Genesis<br />has its structure something like this.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:04:57.710" style="s2">Before we became self-conscious the world<br />was perfect.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.710" end="00:05:01.790" style="s2">As a consequence of the rise of self-consciousness<br />we were thrown out of the Garden of Eden,</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.790" end="00:05:07.190" style="s2">out of paradise and destined to live the profane<br />existence that characterizes our present mode</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.190" end="00:05:11.460" style="s2">of being where we’re subject to knowledge<br />of mortality and the possibility of Illness</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.460" end="00:05:13.620" style="s2">and alienation from God.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.620" end="00:05:19.590" style="s2">And wouldn’t it be ever so great if we could<br />only return to that condition of unself-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.590" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">and make all our problems go away.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">And you see this kind of pathological paradaisal<br />reminiscence manifesting itself in the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:33.760" style="s2">banal forms of conservatism which are always<br />projecting the ideal – the ideal path somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.760" end="00:05:37.250" style="s2">back into the unattainable reaches of time.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.250" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">And also in those situations that obtain psychologically<br />when people are absolutely possessed by depression</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:50.310" style="s2">and anxiety and wish for their consciousness<br />to come to an end if not metaphorically so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.310" end="00:05:57.190" style="s2">they desire to sleep, then actually so that<br />suicide is viewed as a kind of unconsciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.190" end="00:06:02.889" style="s2">whose paradaisal nature, the absence of all<br />opposition, is viewed as clearly preferable</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.889" end="00:06:07.300" style="s2">to the difficulties of actually maintaining<br />being.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.300" end="00:06:17.690" style="s2">Eliade says, the idea of paradise once and<br />then paradise lost is not something unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.690" end="00:06:20.360" style="s2">to Western or great Eastern societies.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.360" end="00:06:26.460" style="s2">It’s a widespread motif, just as wide as<br />the flood motif.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.460" end="00:06:29.310" style="s2">Regardless of where you go in the world you<br />find this notion.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.310" end="00:06:34.870" style="s2">“When heaven had been abruptly separated<br />from the earth, that is when it had become</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.870" end="00:06:41.110" style="s2">remote as in our days, when the tree or vine<br />connecting earth to heaven had been cut or</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.110" end="00:06:45.770" style="s2">the mountain which used to touch the sky had<br />been flattened out then the paradaisal stage</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.770" end="00:06:51.720" style="s2">was over and man entered into his present<br />fallen condition.</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.720" end="00:06:57.389" style="s2">In effect all myths of paradise show us primordial<br />man enjoying a beatitude, a spontaneity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.389" end="00:07:02.169" style="s2">freedom which he has unfortunately lost in<br />consequence of the fall.</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.169" end="00:07:07.080" style="s2">That is of what followed upon a mythical event<br />that caused the rupture between heaven and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.080" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">earth.”</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:20.449" style="s2">As I said, Eden is delight, a place of delight,<br />by terminological definition whereas paradise</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.449" end="00:07:23.069" style="s2">is a walled garden.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.069" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">I want to show you what knowing that does<br />for analysis of the relationship between eastern</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:31.770" style="s2">and western thought.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.770" end="00:07:38.330" style="s2">So let me tell you quickly the story of the<br />Buddha and I’m going to represent it fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.330" end="00:07:41.099" style="s2">like this.</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.099" end="00:07:46.270" style="s2">Buddha starts his life in what’s essentially<br />a walled garden by all – by all reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.270" end="00:07:48.199" style="s2">comparative analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.199" end="00:07:55.160" style="s2">And as a consequence of his emergent self-consciousness,<br />the unself-conscious child-like perfection</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.160" end="00:08:00.660" style="s2">of that early state is permanently disrupted<br />so you have a situation where the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.660" end="00:08:05.479" style="s2">redemption story of the East follows precisely<br />the same dramatical tract as the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.479" end="00:08:07.539" style="s2">creation story of the West.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.539" end="00:08:08.990" style="s2">So this is the story.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.990" end="00:08:13.639" style="s2">Buddha’s father is visited by an angel who<br />tells him that his son is going to grow up</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.639" end="00:08:19.610" style="s2">to be the greatest temporal profane ruler<br />the world has ever seen or a great spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.610" end="00:08:20.610" style="s2">leader.</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.610" end="00:08:25.980" style="s2">And his father, being a pragmatic and conservative<br />man, decides that there’s no possible way</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.980" end="00:08:30.919" style="s2">I’m going to allow my son to take the ambivalent<br />road of spiritual enlightenment.</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.919" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">I’m going to allow him to fall completely<br />in love with the world so that he will remain</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:40.190" style="s2">attached to this domain.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.190" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">So prior to Buddha’s birth, his father constructed<br />a great city with walls around it and inside</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2">that city he removes all signs of pain, frustration<br />and disappointment, any sign of ugliness and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:09:00.440" style="s2">age, the only people who are allowed to exist<br />within this city, are those who are in perfect</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.440" end="00:09:05.280" style="s2">mental and physical health, who are paragons<br />of beauty and virtue.</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.280" end="00:09:14.059" style="s2">And the idea that lurks behind that archetypal<br />story is that when a father has a child his</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.059" end="00:09:19.790" style="s2">moral obligation is to shield the developing<br />consciousness of that child from contact with</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.790" end="00:09:26.090" style="s2">any of the horrors of life that could provide<br />the child with an experience too traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.090" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">for that developing consciousness to apprehend.</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:33.179" style="s2">So because it’s an archetypal story it relates<br />to the development of all people, not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.179" end="00:09:37.959" style="s2">the redemptive saviour and that’s the motif<br />that the Buddhist story initially follows.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.959" end="00:09:44.390" style="s2">A good father makes his father fall in love<br />with life by enticing that child into a direct</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.390" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">relationship with all that life has to offer.</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">So Buddha grows up within this walled garden,<br />this unselfconscious paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:57.819" style="s2">But precisely because he’s being shielded<br />to this degree and allowed to mature, his</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.819" end="00:10:03.490" style="s2">consciousness continues to expand and the<br />world outside the boundaries that his parents</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.490" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">have established for him starts to attract<br />his attention.</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:13.020" style="s2">Now we know already that the forbidden fruit,<br />right, the lure of what’s outside the walls</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.020" end="00:10:17.260" style="s2">is something that human beings just can’t<br />keep their mangy little paws off, right?</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.260" end="00:10:22.540" style="s2">We are absolutely uncontrollably curious and<br />the best way to make sure that we investigate</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.540" end="00:10:27.699" style="s2">something is to lay down a structure that<br />says, whatever you do under whatever circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.699" end="00:10:30.030" style="s2">never look there, right?</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.030" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">And then the automatic systems that underlie<br />our orienting and that motivate our seeking</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:39.630" style="s2">experience are constantly pulling our attention<br />precisely to that forbidden spot, compelling</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.630" end="00:10:43.150" style="s2">us to investigate exactly that which has been<br />forbidden.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.150" end="00:10:50.010" style="s2">So because Buddha is a consciousness developing<br />in a healthy manner he immediately becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.010" end="00:10:54.770" style="s2">curious about what lies beyond the limits<br />that have been established with him and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.770" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">makes a decision to go outside of paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:02.170" style="s2">right, which seems a particularly ridiculous<br />thing to do, given that in principle he had</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.170" end="00:11:05.020" style="s2">everything he could possibly want inside the<br />walls.</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.020" end="00:11:09.860" style="s2">But then again we have the troublesome notion<br />of the original sin of Adam, right, which</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.860" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">is that if any of you were offered a forbidden<br />fruit again under circumstances mythologically</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:21.170" style="s2">equivalent to those that obtained in the beginning,<br />you’d immediately reach your hand out and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.170" end="00:11:26.040" style="s2">take it because what we haven’t got for<br />human beings is always far more compelling</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.040" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">than what we have got<br />So Buddha goes outside the walls.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:39.459" style="s2">But his father, who’s a good father although<br />somewhat conservative, decides he’s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.459" end="00:11:43.940" style="s2">to rig the game a little bit so he gets rid<br />of everybody that’s diseased or unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.940" end="00:11:48.300" style="s2">or uncomfortable or ugly or old or anything<br />that could possibly disturb the Buddha.</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.300" end="00:11:53.770" style="s2">and he lines the streets with flower waving<br />women and puts petals on the road and sends</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.770" end="00:11:55.580" style="s2">his son out in a gilded chariot.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.580" end="00:12:00.600" style="s2">But the gods who are lurking around, right,<br />the trouble making gods who represent chaos</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.600" end="00:12:06.700" style="s2">and disorder and the unknown decide to send<br />in front of Buddha a sick man who hobbles</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.700" end="00:12:12.850" style="s2">unsteadily into view.<br />and Buddha asks his retainer precisely what</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.850" end="00:12:18.350" style="s2">this phenomena represents and his retainer<br />says, well you know, human beings like you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.350" end="00:12:24.260" style="s2">since you’re human are subject to the deterioration<br />of these mere physical powers in an arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.260" end="00:12:25.260" style="s2">way.</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.260" end="00:12:28.440" style="s2">And this man is one person who’s been so<br />afflicted.</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.440" end="00:12:34.370" style="s2">And so Buddha is completely disenchanted by<br />his exploratory move out into the terrible</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.370" end="00:12:38.630" style="s2">unknown and runs back into the castle walls<br />and shuts the door and is perfectly happy</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.630" end="00:12:40.220" style="s2">to think of nothing for months.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.220" end="00:12:46.260" style="s2">But then as his anxiety habituates and his<br />curiosity grows, he can’t stand the notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.260" end="00:12:49.520" style="s2">of never going outside the walls again and<br />outside he goes again.</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.520" end="00:12:55.179" style="s2">And this time after his father prepares the<br />route ever so carefully the gods send inside</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.179" end="00:12:57.690" style="s2">an old man who hobbles into view.</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.690" end="00:13:03.510" style="s2">And Buddha look at him in shock and horror<br />and says to his retainer, just precisely what’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.510" end="00:13:04.819" style="s2">going on here?</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.819" end="00:13:08.900" style="s2">And his retainer says, well that’s an old<br />man.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.900" end="00:13:13.110" style="s2">Everybody gets old and you’re going to get<br />old too and that’s the way of all humanity.</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.110" end="00:13:18.910" style="s2">And that’s the point at which Buddha’s<br />self-consciousness expands not to only include</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.910" end="00:13:25.190" style="s2">the possibility of degeneration but to include<br />the temporal horizon that’s characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.190" end="00:13:26.190" style="s2">of life.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.190" end="00:13:30.980" style="s2">And he finds that so terribly shocking that<br />he runs back into the castle and shuts the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.980" end="00:13:34.329" style="s2">walls down and plays with his friends for<br />another six months until his anxiety, or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.329" end="00:13:38.510" style="s2">a year, until his anxiety finally habituates<br />and he goes out one final time.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.510" end="00:13:44.900" style="s2">And this time the gods send a funeral parade<br />for him and he sees his first dead body.</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.900" end="00:13:49.280" style="s2">And this such a terrible shock to him that<br />he can’t even go back to the castle.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.280" end="00:13:54.790" style="s2">So his father prepares for him a great party<br />in the woods near the castle full of nude</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.790" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">dancing women who are perfectly willing to<br />flaunt themselves and to offer themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:13:59.880" style="s2">to him.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.880" end="00:14:04.750" style="s2">But Buddha is so absolutely and catastrophically<br />shocked by this notion of emergent death that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.750" end="00:14:09.140" style="s2">he can’t take any pleasure whatsoever in<br />what’s being offered to him and he leaves</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.140" end="00:14:11.370" style="s2">the kingdom once and for all.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.370" end="00:14:15.110" style="s2">And you think, well that’s exactly what<br />happens to you when you grow up, right?</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.110" end="00:14:19.459" style="s2">If you’re reasonably well socialized and<br />properly looked after then your curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.459" end="00:14:23.460" style="s2">gets the better of you and you keep going<br />out into the world until what your parents</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.460" end="00:14:27.069" style="s2">have established for you is no longer sufficient<br />for you.</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.069" end="00:14:31.130" style="s2">And as a consequence of that movement out<br />into the world, you find out all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.130" end="00:14:36.669" style="s2">things characteristic of your own life that<br />not only your parents can’t precisely explain</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.669" end="00:14:42.420" style="s2">to you but even the broader formal structures<br />of your culture have a very difficult time</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.420" end="00:14:43.420" style="s2">handling.</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.420" end="00:14:49.490" style="s2">And when you finally do encounter such realities<br />and allow their effect on you to fully manifest</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.490" end="00:14:55.339" style="s2">itself well then you’re finally independent<br />and you no longer can return home.</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.339" end="00:14:59.850" style="s2">But from that point forward you’re also<br />burdened as Adam is burdened when he loses</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.850" end="00:15:06.140" style="s2">his paradaisal unself-consciousness with the<br />full revelation of what it means to be limited</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.140" end="00:15:07.350" style="s2">and alive.</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.350" end="00:15:11.070" style="s2">So what happens to Buddha as a consequence<br />of this revelation?</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.070" end="00:15:17.460" style="s2">He becomes an apprentice and the chronicles<br />of the Buddha’s adventure are careful to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.460" end="00:15:24.760" style="s2">say that he becomes the world’s most proficient<br />practitioner of Samkhya, which was a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.760" end="00:15:27.260" style="s2">precursor to yoga and then to yoga.</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.260" end="00:15:31.569" style="s2">So he masters all the positions and the asanas<br />until he’s disciplined physically to an</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.569" end="00:15:33.540" style="s2">almost unlimited degree.</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.540" end="00:15:38.429" style="s2">And then he decides that he’ll adopt a stance<br />of world renunciation which is also something</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.429" end="00:15:40.140" style="s2">he’s remarkably good at.</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.140" end="00:15:44.699" style="s2">And he starves himself until the chroniclers<br />say he resembles nothing so much as a pile</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.699" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">of dust.</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:51.140" style="s2">And then, having exhausted all the disciplinary<br />structures that his sophisticated culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.140" end="00:15:57.240" style="s2">has to offer him but still not precisely finding<br />the answer that he’s looking for, he retreats</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:03.320" style="s2">into the forest, place of the unknown, and<br />sits himself at the base of a tree.</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.320" end="00:16:06.520" style="s2">Underneath the tree he’s visited by visions<br />and temptations.</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.520" end="00:16:09.660" style="s2">The first vision is an essentially erotic<br />one.</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.660" end="00:16:16.309" style="s2">Life itself tempts him back out of his self-conscious<br />state into the domain of pure physical pleasure,</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.309" end="00:16:20.530" style="s2">a perfectly reasonable temptation, right,<br />and one that’s powerful enough so that Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.530" end="00:16:27.160" style="s2">philosophers say as their churches and cathedrals<br />are covered with erotic drawings, if you can’t</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.160" end="00:16:31.390" style="s2">get past the erotic drawings into the church<br />that’s the domain that you should still</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.390" end="00:16:32.470" style="s2">inhabit, right.</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.470" end="00:16:36.660" style="s2">In the dawning phases of life at least till<br />middle age that’s the appropriate mode of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.660" end="00:16:42.020" style="s2">being to be enticed and seduced by the physical<br />pleasures that life has to offer.</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.020" end="00:16:47.870" style="s2">But in the final analysis those are not sufficient<br />to solve the problem of emergent self-consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.870" end="00:16:55.280" style="s2">And so the angel of death visits him and offers<br />him the opportunity to exist permanently in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.280" end="00:16:56.360" style="s2">a state of nirvana.</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.360" end="00:17:02.020" style="s2">A very, very interesting twist on the story<br />because you have to wonder, given the association</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.020" end="00:17:07.419" style="s2">say between suicidelity and the notion of<br />paradise that exists underneath that, if what</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.419" end="00:17:12.280" style="s2">Buddha isn’t being offered by the angel<br />of death is in fact death and the cessation</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.280" end="00:17:17.579" style="s2">of all the problems of being regardless he<br />rejects that, attains enlightenment briefly</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.579" end="00:17:22.600" style="s2">and then decides to return to the world to<br />share what he’s discovered with all of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.600" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">humanity.</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">The idea being that the Buddha who is the<br />awakened or enlightened one is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:36.440" style="s2">attaining a transcendent state but also knows<br />fully that because human beings have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.440" end="00:17:42.550" style="s2">social aspect it is not possible for any one<br />person to attain redemption until all people</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.550" end="00:17:48.490" style="s2">attain redemption, the reason being that it’s<br />very difficult to be transcendent and enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.490" end="00:17:56.800" style="s2">when you see someone who’s sick lying in<br />a ditch.</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.800" end="00:18:06.250" style="s2">So then we shift from that back to Genesis<br />and the tempted fall of man and read the third</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.250" end="00:18:07.250" style="s2">chapter.</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.250" end="00:18:10.410" style="s2">And they were both naked, the man and his<br />wife and were not ashamed.</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.410" end="00:18:11.720" style="s2">Well what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.720" end="00:18:15.950" style="s2">Well, Freud pointed out that one of human<br />being’s most common nightmares is to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.950" end="00:18:18.370" style="s2">stripped of clothing in front of a crowd.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.370" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">Now why would that be precisely?</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:26.300" style="s2">Well your naked self is the most vulnerable<br />aspect of you, right?</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.300" end="00:18:28.650" style="s2">We’re all clothed and for good reason.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.650" end="00:18:32.140" style="s2">Partly that’s protection from the terrible<br />natural world, right?</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.140" end="00:18:38.110" style="s2">But it also offers us the possibility of placing<br />a barrier between ourselves, our vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.110" end="00:18:42.610" style="s2">selves and the searching and critical gaze<br />of the community, right?</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.610" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">Because not only are we vulnerable to the<br />rigours of nature, we’re also vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:51.140" style="s2">to the depredations and criticisms of society.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.140" end="00:18:56.550" style="s2">And the notion that a man and a woman could<br />exist naked and not know it is a clear – is</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.550" end="00:19:03.780" style="s2">a clear finger pointing in the direction of<br />a story that says these people were not conscious</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.780" end="00:19:07.870" style="s2">or if conscious they certainly were not self-conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.870" end="00:19:09.890" style="s2">And how does the story develop?</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.890" end="00:19:14.820" style="s2">&quot;The serpent was more subtle than any beast<br />of the field which the Lord God had made.</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.820" end="00:19:19.560" style="s2">And he said unto the woman: yea, hath God<br />said you shall not eat of every tree in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.560" end="00:19:20.560" style="s2">Garden.</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.560" end="00:19:24.200" style="s2">And the woman said unto the serpent, well<br />we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.200" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">Garden but of the fruit of the tree which<br />is in the centre of the Garden God has said</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:33.690" style="s2">you should not eat of it, neither shall you<br />touch it lest ye die.</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.690" end="00:19:40.890" style="s2">And the serpent said to the woman: you won’t<br />die for God knows that in the day you eat</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.890" end="00:19:47.130" style="s2">thereof then your eyes shall be opened, right,<br />a clear pointing to the notion of an awakening</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.130" end="00:19:53.330" style="s2">and an illumination-- And ye shall be like<br />gods knowing good and evil,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.330" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">right, which attributes to humanity, a dawning<br />sense of morality explicit morality, the faculty</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.650" style="s2">for comprehension that we do not share with<br />any other animal.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.650" end="00:20:07.480" style="s2">&quot;And when the woman saw that the tree was<br />good for food and that it was pleasant to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.480" end="00:20:11.680" style="s2">the eyes and a tree to be desired to make<br />one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.680" end="00:20:16.470" style="s2">did eat and gave also unto her husband with<br />her and he did eat.</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.470" end="00:20:19.270" style="s2">&quot;<br />Women, trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.270" end="00:20:21.590" style="s2">What’s the tree?</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.590" end="00:20:23.630" style="s2">Well we talked about this a little bit before.</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.630" end="00:20:29.470" style="s2">So you say, well if you look at the structure<br />of experience from this particular perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.470" end="00:20:33.220" style="s2">and you think about that in a horizontal plane,<br />vertical plane, sorry, with the layers one</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.220" end="00:20:38.020" style="s2">on top of another, then you can imagine the<br />tree as the thing that unites these three</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.020" end="00:20:39.020" style="s2">layers.</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.020" end="00:20:43.770" style="s2">The tree is the domain that unites chaos and<br />order and the individual, the structure running</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.770" end="00:20:45.260" style="s2">up through the middle of it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.260" end="00:20:49.680" style="s2">And you see a representation of that interestingly<br />enough, from Norse mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.680" end="00:20:55.540" style="s2">This is the Yggdrasill the axis mundi the<br />tree of the gods, the tree that stands in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.540" end="00:20:58.280" style="s2">the middle of the Norse paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.280" end="00:21:01.400" style="s2">And one of the things that’s very interesting<br />about this particular tree is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.400" end="00:21:06.570" style="s2">look at its roots the roots are covered with<br />snakes and serpents and underneath the snakes</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.570" end="00:21:08.220" style="s2">and serpents is water.</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.220" end="00:21:14.980" style="s2">And so that you see that the tree that stands<br />at the centre of the world is rooted in chaos</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.980" end="00:21:21.140" style="s2">fundamentally, is rooted in whatever it is<br />that constitutes the pre-cosmogonic matrix</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.140" end="00:21:22.270" style="s2">of being.</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.270" end="00:21:30.680" style="s2">And then the central aspects of this domain<br />are nicely laid out as the domain of territoriality,</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.680" end="00:21:35.140" style="s2">the ends of the borders that the individual<br />understands and the habitual territory that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.140" end="00:21:41.020" style="s2">he inhabits and then the tree in the centre<br />represents whatever it is that’s central</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.020" end="00:21:44.440" style="s2">to this – to our mode of being.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.440" end="00:21:50.190" style="s2">And so let’s take a look at that in some<br />detail and flesh it out symbolically.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.190" end="00:21:57.540" style="s2">We find Eliade is saying the tree that stands<br />hypothetically at the centre of the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.540" end="00:22:03.020" style="s2">is precisely that structure that shamans climb<br />when they make their transition from normal</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.020" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">mode of earthly being into their transcendent<br />mode of being.</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:11.320" style="s2">So Eliade says the symbolism of the ascension<br />into heaven by means of a tree is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.320" end="00:22:15.410" style="s2">illustrated by the ceremony of initiation<br />of a Buryat shaman.</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.410" end="00:22:19.750" style="s2">The candidate climbs up a post in the middle<br />of his yurt, his tent, reaches the summit</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.750" end="00:22:21.770" style="s2">and goes out by the smoke hole.</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.770" end="00:22:25.990" style="s2">But we know that this opening made to let<br />out the smoke is likened to the hole made</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.990" end="00:22:28.490" style="s2">by the pole star in the bulk of heaven.</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.490" end="00:22:33.530" style="s2">So you can imagine there’s a conceptualization<br />of the world as centred around a particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.530" end="00:22:39.860" style="s2">axis and that the tent is regarded as, at<br />least transitorily as a symbolic equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.860" end="00:22:43.050" style="s2">of the cosmological structure.</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.050" end="00:22:46.730" style="s2">Among other peoples the tent hole is called<br />the pillar of the sky and is compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.730" end="00:22:52.070" style="s2">pole star around which the world rotates,<br />at least from the visual perspective and is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.070" end="00:22:53.930" style="s2">named elsewhere the nail of the sky.</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.930" end="00:22:58.230" style="s2">Thus, the ritual post set up in the middle<br />of the yurt is an image of the cosmic tree</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.230" end="00:23:02.260" style="s2">which is found at the centre of the world<br />with the pole star shining directly above</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.260" end="00:23:03.260" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.260" end="00:23:06.520" style="s2">By ascending it, the candidate enters into<br />heaven.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.520" end="00:23:10.370" style="s2">That is why as soon as he comes out of the<br />smoke hole of the tent he gives a loud cry</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.370" end="00:23:19.460" style="s2">invoking the help of the gods Up there he<br />finds himself in their presence.</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.460" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">The tree is an absolutely archaic symbol and<br />it seems to me most likely that it represents</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:28.450" style="s2">the structure of the nervous system.</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.450" end="00:23:33.750" style="s2">I think a structure that’s rooted not so<br />much in the spinal, sensory motor structures</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.750" end="00:23:40.420" style="s2">but deeply in the autonomic structures, stretching<br />down into the centre of the body and planting</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.420" end="00:23:45.980" style="s2">the mind firmly in its material substrate<br />so that the autonomic system and its projections</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.980" end="00:23:51.260" style="s2">up into the amigdylla and limbic system and<br />then up into the cortex constitute the interface</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.260" end="00:23:56.360" style="s2">between the spiritual domain that our psyche<br />inhabits and the material domain that constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.360" end="00:23:57.490" style="s2">our body.</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.490" end="00:24:02.330" style="s2">The tree at the centre of our being.</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.330" end="00:24:03.330" style="s2">What does the tree do?</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.330" end="00:24:04.900" style="s2">Well it bears fruit.</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.900" end="00:24:06.330" style="s2">Well what sort of fruit?</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.330" end="00:24:11.630" style="s2">Well there are multiple medieval representations<br />that are quite peculiar showing Christ, for</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.630" end="00:24:15.500" style="s2">example, as the fruit of the tree of the knowledge<br />of good and evil.</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.500" end="00:24:16.650" style="s2">The fruit of the tree of life.</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.650" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">And what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.960" end="00:24:23.350" style="s2">It means that conceptualizations like the<br />hero are the products of whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.350" end="00:24:25.610" style="s2">this tree represents.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.610" end="00:24:28.110" style="s2">The tree is something that produces fruit.</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.110" end="00:24:31.390" style="s2">Fruit is also something that can be ingested.</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.390" end="00:24:42.190" style="s2">And as Eric Newman points out wherever liquor,<br />fruit, herbs, etc. appear as the vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.190" end="00:24:47.130" style="s2">of life and immortality, including the water<br />and bread of life, the sacrament of the host</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.130" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">and every form of food cult down to the present<br />day we have an ancient mode of human expression</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:53.350" style="s2">before us.</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.350" end="00:24:59.280" style="s2">So imagine the idea of the – of the Piagetian<br />idea of assimilation and then accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.280" end="00:25:05.340" style="s2">and then understand its assimilative, nutritive,<br />underlying metaphorical nature.</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.340" end="00:25:11.010" style="s2">The idea being that there’s a tight analogy<br />between ingesting something material and undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.010" end="00:25:13.770" style="s2">a transformation of energy.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.770" end="00:25:18.200" style="s2">Attendant upon that, right, which is what<br />happens when you eat and ingesting a piece</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.200" end="00:25:23.580" style="s2">of information which offers you a new mode<br />of doing things so you can say well people</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.580" end="00:25:26.200" style="s2">will trade work for information.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.200" end="00:25:29.450" style="s2">They will trade food for information.</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.450" end="00:25:33.950" style="s2">There must be a kind of equivalence between<br />work and information and food and information</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.950" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">because otherwise the trade wouldn’t make<br />sense.</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:42.330" style="s2">And then you realize that if you’re informed<br />you can undertake transformations of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.330" end="00:25:46.900" style="s2">and the material world in a much more efficient<br />manner because that’s what being informed</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.900" end="00:25:47.900" style="s2">means.</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.900" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">And that means that being informed, acquiring<br />some information and eating something are</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:56.980" style="s2">all tied up in a complex way into the same<br />metaphorical structure.</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:02.140" style="s2">Eat something forbidden, transform as a consequence.</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.140" end="00:26:07.040" style="s2">Conscious realization is acted out in the<br />elementary scheme of nutritive assimilation</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.040" end="00:26:11.650" style="s2">and a ritual act of concrete eating is the<br />first assimilation known to man.</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.650" end="00:26:12.650" style="s2">Conscious realization is acted out through<br />ritual by an act of eating.</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.650" end="00:26:13.650" style="s2">Since the act of eating represents a very<br />familiar example of assimilation.</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.650" end="00:26:19.080" style="s2">The assimilation and ingestion of the content,<br />the eaten food, produces an inner change.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.080" end="00:26:23.050" style="s2">Transformation of the body cell through food<br />intake is the most elementary of animal changes</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.050" end="00:26:25.680" style="s2">experienced by man.</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.680" end="00:26:30.690" style="s2">How a weary, enfeebled and famished man can<br />be turned into an alert, strong and satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.690" end="00:26:35.880" style="s2">being or a man perishing of thirst can be<br />refreshed or even transformed by an intoxicating</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.880" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">drink.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:42.180" style="s2">This is and must remain a fundamental experience<br />so long a man shall exist.</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.180" end="00:26:49.800" style="s2">Eric Newman’s point being that our psychological<br />experience of the capacity of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.800" end="00:26:56.170" style="s2">transformation through eating is a metaphor<br />waiting to be applied to the equivalent experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.170" end="00:27:00.930" style="s2">that we obtain, the equivalent excitement<br />and sense of transformative possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.930" end="00:27:07.510" style="s2">we acquire as a consequence of coming across<br />some new and truly valuable piece of information.</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.510" end="00:27:12.510" style="s2">So you have the idea that the tree that stands<br />at the centre of the world, the individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.510" end="00:27:15.720" style="s2">mode of being, is something that bears fruit.</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.720" end="00:27:20.630" style="s2">And the ingestion of that fruit, that idea<br />say or that piece of information is something</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.630" end="00:27:23.540" style="s2">that can produce a permanent transformation.</p>
