<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">always any resources we discuss there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:38.729" style="s2">be links to on the episode page at Jim</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">rutt show dot-com so let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.729" end="00:01:42.420" style="s2">talking a little bit about technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">and education we talked about it a fair</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.420" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">amount in the first two episodes but a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:49.229" style="s2">lot of it was sort of conceptual and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">almost full of Safa chol I wonder if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.229" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">could get down to some specific examples</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">of how technology is used in in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:59.000" style="s2">education or could be used in education</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">maybe an example or two about</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">not-so-good use and would be really</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:07.759" style="s2">interesting is some examples or at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:11.460" style="s2">possibilities of good productive use of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.759" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">technology and education totally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.460" end="00:02:15.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s important because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:19.380" style="s2">actually accelerated the trend towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.800" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">kind of digitally delivered education</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.380" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2">probably by five to ten years just as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">result of the pandemic kind of closing</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:31.820" style="s2">down of the schools and so a couple</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">examples right so when you think of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.820" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">educational technology a few things come</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">to mind right one is computers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:46.260" style="s2">laptops in every child&#39;s hand all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">the other is resources like Khan Academy</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.260" end="00:02:53.670" style="s2">or YouTube which are incredible actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:56.130" style="s2">from a variety of perspectives so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.670" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">there&#39;s this notion that if you simply</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.130" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">put a laptop in every kid&#39;s hand and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.380" end="00:03:06.240" style="s2">show them basically how to use Khan</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:08.910" style="s2">Academy well and step back it&#39;ll all</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.240" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">just basically work out and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.910" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">interesting when you look at that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">scenario is that it&#39;s not a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:16.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not wrong it&#39;s just not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">comprehensive approach that could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.890" end="00:03:22.770" style="s2">used to handle every child it could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:25.110" style="s2">useful for a small number of children in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.770" end="00:03:27.770" style="s2">a certain amount of kind of like well</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.110" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">constrained contexts but in general an</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.770" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">informational environment like YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:33.630" style="s2">in informational environments not an</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">educational environment I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.630" end="00:03:38.010" style="s2">educational environment is structured in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:40.980" style="s2">an extremely specific way and involves</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.010" end="00:03:42.630" style="s2">this dynamic of joint attention and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.980" end="00:03:45.560" style="s2">teacherly Authority which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.630" end="00:03:47.730" style="s2">discussed in the previous episodes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.560" end="00:03:49.380" style="s2">so the way to think about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.730" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">in YouTube&#39;s probably the best example</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.380" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">because if you simply place a kid in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:03:57.960" style="s2">front of a YouTube YouTube will capture</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:04:00.360" style="s2">the kid and basically suggest the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.960" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">video for the kid to watch based on what</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.360" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">the kid has watched and so everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">knows this as a helga rhythm so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.530" end="00:04:08.820" style="s2">question of educational in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:11.790" style="s2">curriculum it&#39;s all about sequencing</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.820" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">like what&#39;s the sequence of videos that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.790" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">the kid watches on YouTube why is he</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:19.950" style="s2">watching this sequence of videos as</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:21.480" style="s2">opposed to say some other the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.950" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">that if you just think simply place the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.480" end="00:04:25.160" style="s2">kid in front of YouTube the sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:27.980" style="s2">videos will be given</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.160" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">not an incentive to capture attention to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.980" end="00:04:33.770" style="s2">sell advertisements I wish it was more</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:36.470" style="s2">complicated than that but it&#39;s not so of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.770" end="00:04:39.350" style="s2">all the possible sequences that the kid</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:41.780" style="s2">could have let&#39;s say beginning of video</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.350" end="00:04:44.660" style="s2">about some historical topic like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.780" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">American Revolution right there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.660" end="00:04:51.080" style="s2">number of actually really rigorous kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">of very informative and nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.080" end="00:04:54.650" style="s2">sequences that the kid could watch from</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">the simple introductory to the more</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.650" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">complex of the focus on a specific</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:05:02.180" style="s2">historical incident than some specific</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:04.190" style="s2">historical characters right like in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">revolution so those sequences exist</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.190" end="00:05:10.460" style="s2">within YouTube but they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">curated by educators not by algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.460" end="00:05:18.440" style="s2">that are mining attention for profit and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:21.980" style="s2">so this is just to say that left alone</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.440" end="00:05:25.040" style="s2">YouTube is not an educational technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.980" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">but with the right structure and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.040" end="00:05:30.740" style="s2">of discipline around screen usage you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:35.030" style="s2">can curate resources in some of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.740" end="00:05:38.090" style="s2">types of environments to craft really</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.030" end="00:05:41.480" style="s2">rich sequences of exposure to a variety</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.090" end="00:05:43.730" style="s2">of media coming from places that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.480" end="00:05:45.080" style="s2">know even five five let alone ten years</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.730" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">ago which just simply wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.080" end="00:05:49.310" style="s2">available generally</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:51.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of amazing thing at</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.310" end="00:05:53.540" style="s2">this moment is that it&#39;s so much of it -</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.410" end="00:05:55.580" style="s2">they&#39;re so much of what we need for</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.540" end="00:05:58.310" style="s2">completely decentralized and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.580" end="00:06:00.620" style="s2">technologically robust and completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.310" end="00:06:02.510" style="s2">individualized education for every child</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.620" end="00:06:05.720" style="s2">alive is just sitting there at our</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.510" end="00:06:08.950" style="s2">fingertips but the intermediaries the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.720" end="00:06:11.720" style="s2">content delivery systems the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.950" end="00:06:14.630" style="s2">media and form in which these things are</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.720" end="00:06:16.700" style="s2">held and presented obscures that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.630" end="00:06:18.140" style="s2">possibility greatly so that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.700" end="00:06:19.790" style="s2">example of like the negative side and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.140" end="00:06:24.220" style="s2">the positive side I already was</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.790" end="00:06:26.450" style="s2">mentioning which is that if you create a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.220" end="00:06:28.910" style="s2">container in which educational</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.450" end="00:06:32.419" style="s2">technology is used and these containers</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.910" end="00:06:34.130" style="s2">are relationships right that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.419" end="00:06:36.290" style="s2">characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.130" end="00:06:38.270" style="s2">actual legitimate teacherly Authority</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.290" end="00:06:41.690" style="s2">and for more on that you can see I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.270" end="00:06:44.270" style="s2">it&#39;s episode one right and that we spoke</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.690" end="00:06:45.470" style="s2">about teacher Li Authority at length but</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.270" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">the idea here is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:49.910" style="s2">technology is a tool and you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:51.320" style="s2">relationship with a piece of technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.910" end="00:06:53.510" style="s2">but it&#39;s different than the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.320" end="00:06:55.000" style="s2">you have with a teacher right like I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.510" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">have a relationship with a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.000" end="00:06:59.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve relationship with my car but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:01.610" style="s2">would never confuse that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.630" end="00:07:04.370" style="s2">with a relationship I have with my wife</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.610" end="00:07:06.500" style="s2">or my you know dissertation adviser and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.370" end="00:07:09.050" style="s2">so that&#39;s an important thing is that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.500" end="00:07:11.620" style="s2">have to position the technology in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.050" end="00:07:15.380" style="s2">conversation between teacher and student</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.620" end="00:07:17.330" style="s2">as opposed to basically having the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.380" end="00:07:18.530" style="s2">technology be the center of attention so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.330" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">that means you&#39;re repurposing things</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.530" end="00:07:23.390" style="s2">like YouTube and repurposing things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:25.400" style="s2">Khan Academy and human repurposing</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.390" end="00:07:27.530" style="s2">things like Wikipedia and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.400" end="00:07:31.100" style="s2">articles available for free through</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.530" end="00:07:34.790" style="s2">things like JSTOR now and so what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.100" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">get there is basically a empowerment of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.790" end="00:07:40.790" style="s2">the teacher as curator but this also</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:42.670" style="s2">requires a lot of discipline and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.790" end="00:07:45.080" style="s2">again there&#39;s a tendency to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.670" end="00:07:47.480" style="s2">looking at a screen watching content</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.080" end="00:07:50.870" style="s2">with something like education or</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.480" end="00:07:52.820" style="s2">educational technology so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.870" end="00:07:55.610" style="s2">little bit on specifics because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.820" end="00:07:57.800" style="s2">actually not solving specific technical</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.610" end="00:08:00.590" style="s2">problems in the field of educational</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.800" end="00:08:02.870" style="s2">technology it&#39;s solving the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.590" end="00:08:04.340" style="s2">human machine interface problem what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.870" end="00:08:05.870" style="s2">that problem actually in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.340" end="00:08:08.450" style="s2">educational technology it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.870" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">complex than student looks at screen it</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.450" end="00:08:11.630" style="s2">ends up having to be this dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:14.810" style="s2">teach really Authority in which the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.630" end="00:08:18.710" style="s2">educational technology is is placed so a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.810" end="00:08:21.620" style="s2">YouTube rabbit hole right catalyzed by a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.710" end="00:08:23.780" style="s2">kind of extractive algorithmic sequence</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.620" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">through a set of videos that captures</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.780" end="00:08:27.860" style="s2">the kid attention it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:29.260" style="s2">different than one or two videos placed</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.860" end="00:08:31.310" style="s2">before the kid followed with</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.260" end="00:08:33.080" style="s2">conversation amongst himself teacher</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.310" end="00:08:34.969" style="s2">another kid and maybe the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.080" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">takes place on video conference maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.969" end="00:08:38.419" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:41.030" style="s2">so I&#39;m actually kind of like taking a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.419" end="00:08:43.070" style="s2">perspective of dialing back the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.030" end="00:08:45.280" style="s2">ambitiousness of what people would like</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.070" end="00:08:46.660" style="s2">to achieve with a digital and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.280" end="00:08:49.449" style="s2">repositioning</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.660" end="00:08:53.410" style="s2">the situation between the human the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.449" end="00:08:54.829" style="s2">machine and and nature so I&#39;ll pause</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.410" end="00:08:58.279" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.829" end="00:08:59.869" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that very clear actually as</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.279" end="00:09:01.339" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking it through listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.869" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">talk as we talked about in the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.339" end="00:09:06.019" style="s2">episode I&#39;m an online product</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">development guy at heart product manager</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.019" end="00:09:09.050" style="s2">if I ever had to actually have an honest</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:11.149" style="s2">job that&#39;s probably what I&#39;d have to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.050" end="00:09:13.429" style="s2">and I&#39;m thinking about it doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.149" end="00:09:16.249" style="s2">all that hard you imagine an interface</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.429" end="00:09:18.589" style="s2">where the teacher can set a curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.249" end="00:09:21.769" style="s2">for an individual student personalized</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.589" end="00:09:25.309" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially a series of exposures</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.769" end="00:09:26.449" style="s2">to well curated by the teacher for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.309" end="00:09:28.699" style="s2">student probably starting with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.449" end="00:09:30.649" style="s2">template for a kid of that age and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.699" end="00:09:32.899" style="s2">say it&#39;s the unit on the American</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.649" end="00:09:34.369" style="s2">Revolution it&#39;s as you say within a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.899" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">container think of it it&#39;s a web</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.369" end="00:09:38.809" style="s2">application that the kid goes and looks</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:41.179" style="s2">at a couple things and gets engaged</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.809" end="00:09:43.160" style="s2">perhaps in a forum discussion with their</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.179" end="00:09:44.679" style="s2">classmates with the teacher monitoring</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.160" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">and maybe jumping in where necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.679" end="00:09:49.449" style="s2">then the piece you didn&#39;t mention and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.420" end="00:09:52.730" style="s2">know this is of great interest of yours</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.449" end="00:09:55.129" style="s2">professionally is typically the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.730" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">early role also includes some assessment</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.129" end="00:09:59.720" style="s2">right did the kid actually watch the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:02.179" style="s2">video and did they extract something at</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.720" end="00:10:04.279" style="s2">least semi-reasonable from it so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.179" end="00:10:07.309" style="s2">know let&#39;s say there&#39;s a good video on</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.279" end="00:10:09.860" style="s2">the Federalist Papers right it&#39;s roll</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.309" end="00:10:12.350" style="s2">the content in it who the personalities</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.860" end="00:10:15.019" style="s2">were etc and then at the end there could</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.350" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">be a little quiz that checks to see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.019" end="00:10:19.879" style="s2">the kid actually did watch the video and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">took away some at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.879" end="00:10:24.350" style="s2">plausible perspective from it and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:25.639" style="s2">could you know be a resource that exists</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.350" end="00:10:27.829" style="s2">out in the world as well and to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.639" end="00:10:30.110" style="s2">reused the teacher could modify it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.829" end="00:10:32.089" style="s2">perhaps a little bit but could start</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.110" end="00:10:34.129" style="s2">with a you know well crafted assessment</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.089" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">for that video you know thinking of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.129" end="00:10:38.360" style="s2">system of that sort doesn&#39;t seem very</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:39.619" style="s2">hard at all I mean frankly I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.360" end="00:10:41.990" style="s2">a damn thing about the current state of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.619" end="00:10:44.449" style="s2">play educational technology do such</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.990" end="00:10:46.540" style="s2">things exist today to allow a teacher to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.449" end="00:10:49.399" style="s2">create a custom set of online</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.540" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">experiences with you know discussion</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.399" end="00:10:55.999" style="s2">Intermezzo and assessment etc absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:57.919" style="s2">Jim and that&#39;s actually like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.999" end="00:11:01.189" style="s2">growth market in the educational</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.919" end="00:11:04.129" style="s2">technology space are these very complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.189" end="00:11:06.740" style="s2">kind of like curriculum housing content</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.129" end="00:11:07.420" style="s2">delivery systems that also have ways of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.740" end="00:11:09.710" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.420" end="00:11:12.950" style="s2">student assessment administration</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.710" end="00:11:14.750" style="s2">student assessment scoring grading so</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.950" end="00:11:17.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of these I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.750" end="00:11:20.570" style="s2">like come speak to specific ones cuz</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.210" end="00:11:23.720" style="s2">it&#39;s I don&#39;t know actually the current</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.570" end="00:11:26.810" style="s2">state but I do know that the vision you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.720" end="00:11:28.790" style="s2">laid out is one that was hit upon very</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.810" end="00:11:33.080" style="s2">early by for example Khan Academy who</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.790" end="00:11:35.960" style="s2">has a system of basic kind of tests and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.080" end="00:11:37.880" style="s2">quizzes that follow sequences of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.960" end="00:11:41.300" style="s2">mathematic videos and other things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.880" end="00:11:42.920" style="s2">that and so you know it&#39;s also worth</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.300" end="00:11:44.900" style="s2">noting that those same curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.920" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">housing and content delivery systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.900" end="00:11:50.150" style="s2">that track student grading and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:52.490" style="s2">assessment and etc many of them are</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.150" end="00:11:56.870" style="s2">wedded to actually very complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.490" end="00:11:59.779" style="s2">psychometric and user data backends</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.870" end="00:12:01.790" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not even that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.779" end="00:12:04.040" style="s2">assess kids it&#39;s that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.790" end="00:12:07.610" style="s2">completely surveil them and the use of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.040" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">technology the school mandated computer</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.610" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">use gets tracked down to the mouse-click</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:12.830" style="s2">same mins same thing happens in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:13.880" style="s2">corporate environments and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.830" end="00:12:16.460" style="s2">starting to hear some of this because</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.880" end="00:12:18.050" style="s2">everyone&#39;s working from home now but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.460" end="00:12:20.120" style="s2">know it&#39;s capable to have more or less</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.050" end="00:12:23.960" style="s2">almost total transparency through to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.120" end="00:12:25.100" style="s2">someone&#39;s keyboard usage Mouse usage how</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.960" end="00:12:27.560" style="s2">long are they staying on different</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.100" end="00:12:28.820" style="s2">videos things of that nature so one</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.560" end="00:12:30.140" style="s2">thing we need to look at when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.820" end="00:12:34.670" style="s2">looking at what you&#39;re speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.140" end="00:12:36.740" style="s2">these types of kind of like apps that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.670" end="00:12:39.650" style="s2">kind of like captured the entirety of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.740" end="00:12:43.670" style="s2">the educational experience supposedly is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.650" end="00:12:48.200" style="s2">that they are yes subject to over Metro</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.670" end="00:12:49.880" style="s2">fication and like big data saturation</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.200" end="00:12:52.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of like one of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.880" end="00:12:55.190" style="s2">things that tech does in general is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.400" end="00:12:57.890" style="s2">every affordance that might be I come I</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.190" end="00:12:59.180" style="s2">will be used any importance of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.890" end="00:13:01.940" style="s2">technology that could be used like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.180" end="00:13:04.520" style="s2">surveillance of students there&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.940" end="00:13:07.790" style="s2">push to do that so yeah it&#39;s just worth</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.520" end="00:13:11.230" style="s2">noting that there&#39;s a flipside to all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.790" end="00:13:14.740" style="s2">these profound possibilities within</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.230" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">education as a result of this digital</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.740" end="00:13:21.779" style="s2">and that flipside is that we run the</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.339" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">enhanced educational system right that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.380" end="00:13:36.760" style="s2">we in a sense you know don&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:38.890" style="s2">right decision at this turning point in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.760" end="00:13:40.810" style="s2">history of education and educational</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.890" end="00:13:43.420" style="s2">technology because this is as big a</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.890" end="00:13:48.820" style="s2">about before right which convenience was</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.899" end="00:13:51.880" style="s2">involved in like how do we restructure</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.820" end="00:13:54.580" style="s2">schools now that the availability of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.880" end="00:13:57.010" style="s2">books is almost you know trivial can by</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.580" end="00:13:59.140" style="s2">comparison to the hand copied</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.010" end="00:14:02.279" style="s2">manuscripts that were used in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.140" end="00:14:04.390" style="s2">monastic education systems so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.279" end="00:14:06.850" style="s2">profoundly changed the face of society</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.390" end="00:14:09.010" style="s2">and the possibilities within education</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.850" end="00:14:13.390" style="s2">you know the text book became possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.010" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">which John Amos Comenius really was one</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.390" end="00:14:18.550" style="s2">of the key players in seeing that if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:20.140" style="s2">could precisely mass-produce through the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.550" end="00:14:22.990" style="s2">use of the printing press something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.140" end="00:14:25.660" style="s2">a very powerful textbook then you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.990" end="00:14:30.459" style="s2">use that to organize a whole complex new</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.660" end="00:14:33.850" style="s2">kind of schooling system and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.459" end="00:14:37.350" style="s2">similarly the digital is as fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.850" end="00:14:40.390" style="s2">a transformation in the technological</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.350" end="00:14:43.149" style="s2">underpinnings of education as the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.390" end="00:14:46.570" style="s2">printing press but so far I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.149" end="00:14:48.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve fully realized the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.570" end="00:14:49.810" style="s2">the digital in the education space and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.640" end="00:14:52.510" style="s2">that&#39;s some of what my book is about</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.810" end="00:14:54.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like redirecting the social</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.510" end="00:14:56.980" style="s2">imagination away from thinking that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.730" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">digital futures for education are kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.980" end="00:15:02.110" style="s2">of like we&#39;ve got them already or</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:04.660" style="s2">similar to what we&#39;ve already seen and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.110" end="00:15:06.339" style="s2">was I&#39;m incorrect like we this is act</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.660" end="00:15:08.350" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of had a false start here</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.339" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">with the nature of the digital meds</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.350" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">applies across a whole bunch of realms</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:15.029" style="s2">in the internet and so I think yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:17.770" style="s2">the near future we may see people</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.029" end="00:15:20.579" style="s2">pivoting away from the screen based</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.770" end="00:15:23.110" style="s2">delivery system kind of like didactic</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.579" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">videos and quizzes administered by</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.110" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">skineri and learning</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:31.019" style="s2">Fox&#39;s model and actually moved to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:35.080" style="s2">model of no human teacherly authority is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.019" end="00:15:37.720" style="s2">and always will be the key around which</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.080" end="00:15:40.180" style="s2">educational configurations kind of pivot</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.720" end="00:15:43.540" style="s2">and so technology needs to slot into</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.180" end="00:15:45.060" style="s2">that better and richer conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.540" end="00:15:47.320" style="s2">interaction between teacher and student</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.060" end="00:15:49.329" style="s2">rather than technology running</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.320" end="00:15:50.890" style="s2">interference between the richer</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.329" end="00:15:54.310" style="s2">conversation between teacher and student</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.890" end="00:15:56.910" style="s2">which is what&#39;s happening now and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.310" end="00:15:59.410" style="s2">would also require curating the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.910" end="00:16:01.990" style="s2">the information environment that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.410" end="00:16:05.440" style="s2">especially young people but all people</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.990" end="00:16:06.940" style="s2">are exposed to which is I spoke to this</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:09.100" style="s2">the last time you spoke I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.940" end="00:16:12.850" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of one of the main effects</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.100" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">now in socialization beyond what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.850" end="00:16:15.730" style="s2">school would like to do and even what</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:17.260" style="s2">you&#39;d like to do around the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.730" end="00:16:18.459" style="s2">there&#39;s what&#39;s happening for those six</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.260" end="00:16:22.149" style="s2">hours a day when they had a lesson</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.459" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">staring at the screen so there&#39;s a need</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.149" end="00:16:26.649" style="s2">to think about educational technology</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:29.560" style="s2">not just about those technologies used</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.649" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">in school or used in formal educational</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.560" end="00:16:33.370" style="s2">contexts but to realize that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:35.920" style="s2">this technology is actually educational</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.370" end="00:16:37.329" style="s2">technology except we&#39;re using it as if</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.920" end="00:16:39.310" style="s2">it&#39;s technology just to make money</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.329" end="00:16:41.890" style="s2">and so we&#39;re miss educating</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.310" end="00:16:42.970" style="s2">systematically because we don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.890" end="00:16:45.610" style="s2">this thing we&#39;re messing around with</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.970" end="00:16:48.130" style="s2">actually educational technology Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.610" end="00:16:50.220" style="s2">for example Twitter for example even</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.130" end="00:16:53.950" style="s2">Wikipedia so yeah I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.220" end="00:16:56.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of kind of failure of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.950" end="00:16:58.990" style="s2">imagination in the space of digital</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.440" end="00:17:00.250" style="s2">education yeah so I&#39;ll pause there</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.990" end="00:17:02.200" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s almost an endless</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.250" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2">conversation and I&#39;m specifically</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.200" end="00:17:06.669" style="s2">eliminating speaking about specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.750" end="00:17:10.150" style="s2">platforms or apps or things of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.669" end="00:17:12.010" style="s2">nature because I prefer to work at this</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.150" end="00:17:14.439" style="s2">level of kind of like design principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.010" end="00:17:16.020" style="s2">thinking rather than get down into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.439" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">specifics</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.020" end="00:17:20.939" style="s2">yeah it sounds like that you know one</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:23.189" style="s2">could describe what&#39;s being done is</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.939" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">essentially just grinding finer on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.189" end="00:17:27.569" style="s2">same old shitty model right we now have</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:30.179" style="s2">a sausage factory that&#39;s more fully</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.569" end="00:17:32.059" style="s2">automated ah we bought an IBM 360 and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.179" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">hook it up to our sausage factory in</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.059" end="00:17:37.529" style="s2">1967 right without changing the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:39.809" style="s2">and without changing the intent you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.529" end="00:17:42.090" style="s2">as I&#39;m listening to you speak very</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.809" end="00:17:45.059" style="s2">eloquently but again putting my online</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.090" end="00:17:46.440" style="s2">product dude hat on I go you know it</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.059" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be that hard to build something</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.440" end="00:17:50.820" style="s2">like that I mean it&#39;s not trivial it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:52.620" style="s2">you know 20 man years of work maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.820" end="00:17:54.779" style="s2">hundred man years of work something in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.620" end="00:17:56.549" style="s2">that range but even it&#39;s a hundred man</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.779" end="00:17:58.830" style="s2">years of work that&#39;s you know call it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.549" end="00:18:00.840" style="s2">twenty million dollars not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.830" end="00:18:03.330" style="s2">money on the scale of things you know it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.840" end="00:18:06.419" style="s2">seemed like a useful thing for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.330" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">to do is to get yourself and some other</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.419" end="00:18:12.659" style="s2">experts on the future of Education to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">specify in a little bit more detail what</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.659" end="00:18:18.149" style="s2">you think is the right way to go get</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:21.210" style="s2">some consultation from teachers of both</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.149" end="00:18:23.220" style="s2">the formal and the new variety ie you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.210" end="00:18:25.140" style="s2">know parents serving as teachers</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.220" end="00:18:27.659" style="s2">Community Leaders serving his teachers</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.140" end="00:18:30.149" style="s2">and actually build something and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.659" end="00:18:32.610" style="s2">know build it open source so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.149" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">free to everybody and that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.610" end="00:18:37.529" style="s2">inspect and make sure that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:40.380" style="s2">capturing fine grain dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.529" end="00:18:43.500" style="s2">button-pushing kinds of stuff for either</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.380" end="00:18:45.330" style="s2">exploitative or surveillance type</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.500" end="00:18:47.809" style="s2">purposes you know you know on the scale</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.330" end="00:18:50.850" style="s2">of things it&#39;s a very doable project I</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.809" end="00:18:54.330" style="s2">agree I mean the thing to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.850" end="00:18:56.520" style="s2">is the project is actually not just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.330" end="00:19:00.179" style="s2">technological project because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.520" end="00:19:02.279" style="s2">one about reconfiguring teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.179" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">authority right so you can you can build</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.279" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">a technology but the one I&#39;m specifying</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:10.409" style="s2">requires skillful teaching too and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:13.710" style="s2">context in which teach early authority</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.409" end="00:19:15.570" style="s2">are you know held and possible as</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.710" end="00:19:17.780" style="s2">opposed to context where teach early</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:19.670" style="s2">authority is questioned</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.780" end="00:19:21.770" style="s2">yeah I see that it&#39;s being a specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.670" end="00:19:23.810" style="s2">part of the design right to build the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.770" end="00:19:26.030" style="s2">Hawks for teacherly Authority deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.810" end="00:19:27.860" style="s2">into it and I can see where that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.030" end="00:19:28.940" style="s2">actually come in the product flow and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.860" end="00:19:31.220" style="s2">just you know getting sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.940" end="00:19:32.780" style="s2">whiteboarding it in my head as we talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.220" end="00:19:35.150" style="s2">which is something I do all the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.780" end="00:19:36.530" style="s2">unfortunately but yeah so yeah design it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.150" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">with that intent from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.530" end="00:19:41.150" style="s2">course that still has the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:43.490" style="s2">then teaching people how to teach in</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.150" end="00:19:44.930" style="s2">this new paradigm and it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.490" end="00:19:47.660" style="s2">sending them to the Harvard School of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.930" end="00:19:48.680" style="s2">Education to learn how to teach but you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.660" end="00:19:50.180" style="s2">know again that&#39;s a different problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.680" end="00:19:51.890" style="s2">for a different day but one that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.180" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">also have to be addressed to make this</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.890" end="00:19:56.810" style="s2">really be the foundation for a new level</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:19:58.730" style="s2">of teaching the last comment I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.810" end="00:20:01.460" style="s2">make was you talked about we think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.730" end="00:20:04.180" style="s2">all of our online networks at some level</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.460" end="00:20:06.560" style="s2">as teaching tools Facebook Twitter etc</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.180" end="00:20:08.390" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna point out that people used to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.560" end="00:20:11.060" style="s2">say the same thing about television</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.390" end="00:20:13.220" style="s2">right damn television should be used for</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.060" end="00:20:15.140" style="s2">educational purposes not for the Three</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.220" end="00:20:17.000" style="s2">Stooges and I can still remember when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.140" end="00:20:18.590" style="s2">was about in third or fourth grade and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.000" end="00:20:20.870" style="s2">all the parents of all teachers were</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.590" end="00:20:22.820" style="s2">horrified that fourth-grade boys</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.870" end="00:20:24.500" style="s2">favorite idea of a good time after</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.820" end="00:20:26.420" style="s2">school is to sit and watch with his</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.500" end="00:20:28.910" style="s2">buddies sit in somebody&#39;s basement watch</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.420" end="00:20:32.300" style="s2">The Three Stooges right of course there</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.910" end="00:20:34.730" style="s2">was supposedly educational TV on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.300" end="00:20:37.700" style="s2">public channel but the stuff sucked</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.730" end="00:20:39.050" style="s2">nobody watched it etc and it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.700" end="00:20:41.630" style="s2">became a dead end except for a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.050" end="00:20:43.130" style="s2">bit of successful early childhood stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.630" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">like what&#39;s the one with the Muppets</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.130" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">what the hell was that thing called</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:47.990" style="s2">Sesame Street a little quiz otic to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">think that Facebook and Twitter are</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.990" end="00:20:51.110" style="s2">gonna really become educational</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:53.660" style="s2">platforms as opposed to whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.110" end="00:20:57.380" style="s2">hell they are oh no I think they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.660" end="00:20:58.790" style="s2">become the TV of our era and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.380" end="00:21:01.400" style="s2">know it&#39;s funny when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.790" end="00:21:02.780" style="s2">history of Education appropriately it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.400" end="00:21:05.300" style="s2">ends up being in part of history of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.780" end="00:21:06.740" style="s2">Technology so this guy Lawrence Kremen</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.300" end="00:21:08.360" style="s2">who wrote this three-volume history of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.740" end="00:21:10.610" style="s2">American education just called American</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.360" end="00:21:13.220" style="s2">education won a Pulitzer Prize or</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.610" end="00:21:15.530" style="s2">something like that an amazing book he</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.220" end="00:21:18.260" style="s2">looks at television the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.530" end="00:21:20.660" style="s2">television and you know looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.260" end="00:21:22.460" style="s2">rhetoric around TV as it was rolling out</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.660" end="00:21:23.820" style="s2">and it kind of democratized way across</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.460" end="00:21:25.379" style="s2">America the rhetoric or</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.820" end="00:21:27.830" style="s2">and it was that it was the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.379" end="00:21:30.899" style="s2">will would accomplish democracy through</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.830" end="00:21:33.629" style="s2">education and kind of the the you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.899" end="00:21:36.989" style="s2">the mass delivery of high-level</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.629" end="00:21:39.210" style="s2">information and and culture and so when</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.989" end="00:21:40.889" style="s2">I was reading that you could have</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:43.499" style="s2">actually like just taken out the word TV</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.889" end="00:21:44.850" style="s2">and put in the word the Internet and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.499" end="00:21:46.889" style="s2">would have been almost exactly identical</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.850" end="00:21:49.859" style="s2">rhetoric today well not so much today</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.889" end="00:21:52.139" style="s2">but more like in the late 90s before</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.859" end="00:21:53.429" style="s2">everything kind of changed a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.139" end="00:21:55.080" style="s2">and so you had this sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.429" end="00:21:57.239" style="s2">internet was the thing that would</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.080" end="00:21:59.099" style="s2">accomplish democracy through the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.239" end="00:22:01.499" style="s2">dispersal of high-quality information</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.099" end="00:22:02.729" style="s2">across the board but what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.499" end="00:22:04.979" style="s2">television is the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.729" end="00:22:08.669" style="s2">happened incidentally what the internet</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.979" end="00:22:09.539" style="s2">was that advertising intervened and was</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.669" end="00:22:12.029" style="s2">like well you&#39;re not just gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.539" end="00:22:14.190" style="s2">this stuff away right you want to use</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.029" end="00:22:16.979" style="s2">this to make money somehow and so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.190" end="00:22:19.049" style="s2">whole notion that you know brought to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.979" end="00:22:20.999" style="s2">you by our sponsors right which began</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.049" end="00:22:24.509" style="s2">with radio but then amplified up and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.999" end="00:22:27.690" style="s2">through television so it&#39;s again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.509" end="00:22:29.249" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to ever reduce one trend</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.690" end="00:22:31.769" style="s2">in technology why it went one way to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.249" end="00:22:34.830" style="s2">want console factor but the case in both</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.769" end="00:22:36.869" style="s2">the internet and television was that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.830" end="00:22:40.349" style="s2">potential educational use was seen</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.869" end="00:22:42.869" style="s2">immediately and then all of a sudden did</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.349" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">not materialize in the way we thought it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.869" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">would and in fact then the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:48.599" style="s2">became that this is making a stupider</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:52.200" style="s2">the thing that we thought was going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.599" end="00:22:53.970" style="s2">liberate us visa V new educational</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.200" end="00:22:56.970" style="s2">frontiers actually ended up somehow</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.970" end="00:22:59.580" style="s2">closing off access to education now</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.970" end="00:23:02.700" style="s2">we&#39;re stupider because of the television</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.580" end="00:23:04.529" style="s2">internet so that&#39;s interesting it is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.700" end="00:23:06.029" style="s2">again in both cases yes you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.529" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">it&#39;s particularly on the internet I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.029" end="00:23:09.509" style="s2">even as I mentioned before on other</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:10.950" style="s2">episodes I don&#39;t remember I mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.509" end="00:23:12.749" style="s2">the first two episode or not I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.950" end="00:23:15.269" style="s2">involved in building some of the very</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.749" end="00:23:18.509" style="s2">earliest consumer online services back</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.269" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">in 1980 company called the source where</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.509" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">we had most of what&#39;s on the web today</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:24.929" style="s2">literally we had news wires we had chat</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:26.970" style="s2">we had bulletin boards we had email we</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.929" end="00:23:29.609" style="s2">had home shopping and I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.970" end="00:23:32.129" style="s2">quite remarkable but because of the cost</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.609" end="00:23:35.099" style="s2">of the technology at the time it cost</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.129" end="00:23:36.550" style="s2">$100 initiation fee and $10 an hour</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.099" end="00:23:38.530" style="s2">right and go</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:40.330" style="s2">to help pay that well the reason tens of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.530" end="00:23:41.680" style="s2">thousands hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.330" end="00:23:43.150" style="s2">people spent that kind of money because</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.680" end="00:23:45.220" style="s2">there was no other way to do it if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.150" end="00:23:47.380" style="s2">wanted to participate in the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.220" end="00:23:50.800" style="s2">days of the online world that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.380" end="00:23:53.410" style="s2">cost and at that time we were quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.800" end="00:23:56.650" style="s2">that we were doing you know work for</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.410" end="00:23:58.630" style="s2">goodness towards citizenship by just as</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.650" end="00:24:00.790" style="s2">you said you know damn we had a copy of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.630" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">the Constitution online we had access to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.790" end="00:24:05.620" style="s2">all the bills in Congress we actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:07.300" style="s2">went to considerable difficulty to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.620" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">gather that data actually through a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.300" end="00:24:11.830" style="s2">third party and put it on our platform</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:13.960" style="s2">and because of the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.830" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">charging a fairly hefty fee we paid</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.960" end="00:24:18.730" style="s2">those information providers actual</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:20.200" style="s2">royalties and it seemed like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:22.660" style="s2">the right thing and of course because</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.200" end="00:24:25.180" style="s2">people were paying serious money from a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.660" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">design perspective it was not our job to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.180" end="00:24:29.530" style="s2">hold people online forever because</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:31.240" style="s2">they&#39;d quit they&#39;d get a bill for 800</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.530" end="00:24:32.950" style="s2">bucks and you know if they don&#39;t quit</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.240" end="00:24:34.630" style="s2">their wife pulls the plug on them right</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.950" end="00:24:36.430" style="s2">and that used to happen from time to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.630" end="00:24:38.830" style="s2">time people got addicted to the games</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.430" end="00:24:40.690" style="s2">and so we specifically engineered the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.830" end="00:24:42.970" style="s2">platform to get you the most valuable</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.690" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">for the least amount of time possible so</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.970" end="00:24:47.080" style="s2">you could get what you wanted and get</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:50.440" style="s2">the hell off and so their interests and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.080" end="00:24:51.730" style="s2">our interests were aligned at some level</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.440" end="00:24:54.280" style="s2">well when you get to the world of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.730" end="00:24:56.470" style="s2">advertising it&#39;s quite the opposite the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.280" end="00:24:59.080" style="s2">game becomes very perverse the game is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:01.260" style="s2">to reel you in and keep you sitting</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.080" end="00:25:02.860" style="s2">there drooling for as long as possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.260" end="00:25:06.250" style="s2">irrespective of whether you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.860" end="00:25:09.190" style="s2">any benefit or not and so as I have said</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.250" end="00:25:11.410" style="s2">before if I were a dictator god damn it</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.190" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">I would just flat-out law online</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.410" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">advertising period because online</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:18.580" style="s2">advertising is way more pernicious even</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:20.860" style="s2">than TV advertising which is bad enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.580" end="00:25:23.050" style="s2">and the reason for that is because of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.860" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">what you&#39;ve alluded to in passing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.050" end="00:25:26.530" style="s2">then in more detail in an earlier</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:29.320" style="s2">episode is because they track every</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.530" end="00:25:31.240" style="s2">micro behavior and then they even better</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:33.010" style="s2">people don&#39;t know this they also blend</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.240" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">it with demographic data they bought</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.010" end="00:25:37.330" style="s2">from people like axiom which has all</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:39.100" style="s2">your magazine subscriptions when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.330" end="00:25:41.650" style="s2">vote you have a hunting license or not</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:44.230" style="s2">what car you own etc and their micro</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.650" end="00:25:46.150" style="s2">manipulating you at an unbelievably low</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.230" end="00:25:49.060" style="s2">level I frankly think it&#39;s goddamn</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.490" end="00:26:27.910" style="s2">yeah so the eyes of the business of</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">of things that that advertising actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.679" end="00:27:00.309" style="s2">teaches and there&#39;s a hidden curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:01.780" style="s2">advertising deeper which is the layer</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.309" end="00:27:03.610" style="s2">that you&#39;re getting at which is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.780" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s teaching you something about who</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.610" end="00:27:08.740" style="s2">you are what the identity is and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">know at a certain point with television</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.740" end="00:27:13.090" style="s2">advertisement became a an important</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:24.730" style="s2">customized advertisements then I believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.510" end="00:27:27.610" style="s2">that we started to see advertising step</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.730" end="00:27:29.730" style="s2">into more fundamentally dysregulated</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.610" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">identity formation that at any point</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.740" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">fact not been in schools from teachers</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.570" end="00:27:48.100" style="s2">or mom and dad but it has been something</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">like this total saturation of their</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.280" end="00:28:03.630" style="s2">and things that are indistinguishable</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.900" end="00:28:06.120" style="s2">from real life and advertising so get</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.270" end="00:28:54.210" style="s2">episode when I was in elementary school</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.610" end="00:28:55.669" style="s2">kid in the first half of the 1960s we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.210" end="00:28:58.049" style="s2">still had to say the Lord&#39;s Prayer</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.669" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">everyday at the start of school in the</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:04.710" style="s2">good Catholic not anymore</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.610" end="00:29:06.600" style="s2">you know us good Catholics would not say</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.710" end="00:29:09.059" style="s2">the last verse which was the goddamn</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.600" end="00:29:10.890" style="s2">Protestant version but it was still you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.059" end="00:29:12.870" style="s2">know state mandated that you say the</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.870" end="00:29:16.110" style="s2">further south and Leo where we were</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.520" end="00:29:18.929" style="s2">right on the north/south border line</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.110" end="00:29:21.210" style="s2">there was mandatory Bible study and not</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.929" end="00:29:25.290" style="s2">as literature as part of the public</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.210" end="00:29:28.400" style="s2">school curriculum and I must say I still</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.290" end="00:29:32.660" style="s2">have a very strong suspicion of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.400" end="00:29:34.770" style="s2">mixing of religion and education and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.660" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">continue to believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.770" end="00:29:39.419" style="s2">Enlightenment separation of church and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">state was one of the great achievements</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.419" end="00:29:43.320" style="s2">of the human race and I love to point</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:46.380" style="s2">out the people I do believe this is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.320" end="00:29:49.380" style="s2">purest enlightenment document that came</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.380" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">from the 18th century which is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.380" end="00:29:55.080" style="s2">Virginia statute for religious freedom</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:58.620" style="s2">which was first proposed like 1779 was</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.080" end="00:30:00.840" style="s2">finally passed in 1786 the co-authors</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.620" end="00:30:02.429" style="s2">were madison and jefferson you know one</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.840" end="00:30:04.679" style="s2">the author of the Declaration of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.429" end="00:30:06.150" style="s2">Independence Jefferson and the other the</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.150" end="00:30:09.700" style="s2">author of the US Constitution James</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.309" end="00:30:12.039" style="s2">Madison and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.700" end="00:30:14.950" style="s2">was a remarkable document and not only</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.039" end="00:30:16.659" style="s2">did it include religious freedom for</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.950" end="00:30:19.330" style="s2">various denominations at Protestant</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.659" end="00:30:21.580" style="s2">Christians Allah John Locke but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.330" end="00:30:24.549" style="s2">explicitly called out religious freedom</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.580" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">for Jews Muslims and Hindus and its</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.549" end="00:30:29.350" style="s2">course interesting that Jefferson was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:32.019" style="s2">deist and Madison was an outright</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.350" end="00:30:34.120" style="s2">atheist and yet this became the law of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.019" end="00:30:35.529" style="s2">the land in the biggest and richest</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.120" end="00:30:38.830" style="s2">state in what would become the United</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.529" end="00:30:42.250" style="s2">States so I still put my car down pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.830" end="00:30:45.309" style="s2">strongly for that Enlightenment view now</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.250" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">in your book you say that the decline of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.309" end="00:30:50.380" style="s2">religious hypothesis has not panned out</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:52.750" style="s2">leading some to suggest that we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.380" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">entered a post secular era religion is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.750" end="00:30:58.659" style="s2">key node in the emerging transnational</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:31:02.440" style="s2">constellations that will radically shape</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.659" end="00:31:05.190" style="s2">the future of global civilization so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.440" end="00:31:09.750" style="s2">love to get your thought on where</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.190" end="00:31:12.429" style="s2">religion appropriately fits in education</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.750" end="00:31:15.850" style="s2">absolutely and that&#39;s a great that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.429" end="00:31:19.149" style="s2">great framing because I yeah off the bat</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.850" end="00:31:22.029" style="s2">would agree that one of the great steps</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.149" end="00:31:25.299" style="s2">forward in terms of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.029" end="00:31:26.889" style="s2">was this move that ushered in modernity</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.299" end="00:31:29.700" style="s2">of separating church and state</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.889" end="00:31:32.409" style="s2">completely agree what&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.700" end="00:31:33.970" style="s2">you know some of the ethos for that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.409" end="00:31:35.590" style="s2">you mentioned Jefferson was a deist</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.970" end="00:31:37.659" style="s2">and you think about how many of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.590" end="00:31:40.419" style="s2">generation the revolutionary generation</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.659" end="00:31:43.299" style="s2">were deep into the Masonic Order and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.419" end="00:31:47.710" style="s2">involved in certain forms of deism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.299" end="00:31:49.960" style="s2">other forms of actual over mysticism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.710" end="00:31:51.250" style="s2">you look at the move from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.960" end="00:31:53.409" style="s2">Renaissance the Enlightenment right</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.250" end="00:31:56.769" style="s2">which I discuss last time which was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.409" end="00:31:57.940" style="s2">period filled with this sentiment that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.769" end="00:31:59.860" style="s2">would result eventually in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.940" end="00:32:01.870" style="s2">separation of church and state but it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.860" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">was a religious sentiment the move to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.870" end="00:32:06.789" style="s2">create modernity arose from a certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:10.419" style="s2">kind of transformation in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.789" end="00:32:12.700" style="s2">religiosity itself which included you</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.419" end="00:32:14.769" style="s2">know those atheists who were you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.700" end="00:32:17.139" style="s2">more religious than the most religious</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.769" end="00:32:20.260" style="s2">in their atheism in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.139" end="00:32:22.429" style="s2">radicalism and its ability to get them</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.260" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">out of their given social account</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.429" end="00:32:26.419" style="s2">kind of give themselves over to</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:29.330" style="s2">transcendental signifiers you might say</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.419" end="00:32:32.299" style="s2">so there was a submerging move not to</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.299" end="00:32:38.870" style="s2">religions flourish this is the sentiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:40.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not the sentiments at OU right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.870" end="00:32:44.030" style="s2">we&#39;re going to separate church and state</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.120" end="00:32:47.980" style="s2">so that by the time we get to year 2000</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.030" end="00:32:50.330" style="s2">all religions will have disappeared and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.980" end="00:32:52.220" style="s2">everyone will be an atheist and believe</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.330" end="00:32:54.890" style="s2">in scientific materialism that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.220" end="00:32:56.950" style="s2">the sentiment of the founding fathers it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.890" end="00:33:00.730" style="s2">was in fact that we need to allow</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.950" end="00:33:03.169" style="s2">religion to be an open an exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.730" end="00:33:06.160" style="s2">frontier of human experience not</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.169" end="00:33:10.250" style="s2">constrained by dogma and certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.160" end="00:33:13.370" style="s2">captured by political interest and vice</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.250" end="00:33:15.740" style="s2">versa that politics and governance the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.370" end="00:33:18.410" style="s2">the things that allow the land and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.740" end="00:33:21.620" style="s2">people to be safe and to have meaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.410" end="00:33:24.020" style="s2">we can&#39;t port that in from some specific</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.620" end="00:33:28.549" style="s2">religion and confuse political</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.020" end="00:33:31.040" style="s2">sovereignty with you know the places</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.549" end="00:33:33.590" style="s2">where religious authority are sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.040" end="00:33:37.190" style="s2">like in the realms of morality for</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.590" end="00:33:40.340" style="s2">example so it gets interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.190" end="00:33:42.830" style="s2">when you revisit the conversation now in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.340" end="00:33:47.450" style="s2">the context where we&#39;re late postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.830" end="00:33:51.280" style="s2">early meta modern right when we still</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.450" end="00:33:56.270" style="s2">beat this kind of dead horse of</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.280" end="00:33:58.280" style="s2">pre-modern religion and this is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.270" end="00:34:00.020" style="s2">emergence of the post secular age right</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.280" end="00:34:02.990" style="s2">which is a book that Charles Taylor</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.020" end="00:34:05.059" style="s2">wrote and then Hamas has written a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.990" end="00:34:06.770" style="s2">about this Hamas in his later years</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.059" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">returned to reading kirkegaard and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.770" end="00:34:12.350" style="s2">reflecting on this question of what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">the role of religion now in the public</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.350" end="00:34:15.590" style="s2">sphere when all the sociologists thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.899" style="s2">it was going to burn out and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.590" end="00:34:20.540" style="s2">modernity would basically eat religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.899" end="00:34:23.570" style="s2">up and spit out some kind of pure</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.540" end="00:34:25.700" style="s2">nationalism and efficiency oriented like</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.570" end="00:34:28.190" style="s2">economic philosophy but instead it</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.700" end="00:34:31.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t we&#39;ve seen actually a resurgence</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.190" end="00:34:34.070" style="s2">of certain forms of religion religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.070" end="00:34:35.840" style="s2">and it remains the case globally</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.070" end="00:34:37.910" style="s2">the vast vast majority of humans who</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.840" end="00:34:41.570" style="s2">live now and who have ever lived would</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.910" end="00:34:44.750" style="s2">describe themselves as believers or</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.570" end="00:34:47.300" style="s2">members in a religion and yes if the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.750" end="00:34:49.340" style="s2">question then becomes alright separation</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.300" end="00:34:51.080" style="s2">of church and state is in the interest</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.340" end="00:34:53.840" style="s2">not of squashing religion but in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.080" end="00:34:57.020" style="s2">interest of allowing religion to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.840" end="00:34:59.840" style="s2">actually be an independence kind of area</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.020" end="00:35:02.300" style="s2">of human interest and you&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.840" end="00:35:04.250" style="s2">in America you know America has</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.300" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">pioneered the religion of no religion</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.250" end="00:35:07.790" style="s2">right hmm especially with the human</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:10.910" style="s2">potential movement in the sixties and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.790" end="00:35:12.380" style="s2">and so you&#39;re looking at two ways to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.910" end="00:35:14.930" style="s2">think about the question you know one is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.380" end="00:35:16.580" style="s2">that well there&#39;s no place for religion</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.930" end="00:35:18.770" style="s2">at all in education education is just</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.580" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2">about science all right and just about</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.770" end="00:35:27.500" style="s2">facts but now you&#39;ve just made science</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.150" end="00:35:30.820" style="s2">or religion so there&#39;s a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.500" end="00:35:35.410" style="s2">need to think about the curriculum of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.820" end="00:35:37.970" style="s2">educational configurations as about</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.410" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">capacitating individuals to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.970" end="00:35:42.290" style="s2">questions of religion and to consider</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">the questions of science rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.290" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">educational configurations being the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:48.170" style="s2">delivery of certain scientific truths of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:50.540" style="s2">the delivery of certain religious</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.170" end="00:35:52.070" style="s2">beliefs this is a key distinction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.540" end="00:35:54.200" style="s2">deeper than the question of is religion</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.070" end="00:35:56.360" style="s2">in school or not because it&#39;s as a level</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.200" end="00:35:58.460" style="s2">of epistemological orientation of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.360" end="00:36:00.710" style="s2">curriculum and so you can do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.460" end="00:36:04.220" style="s2">we compare the worst forms of religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.710" end="00:36:06.770" style="s2">to the best forms of science right where</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.220" end="00:36:08.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like stupid religious people look</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.770" end="00:36:10.580" style="s2">how smart the scientists are but you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.900" end="00:36:14.030" style="s2">also do the thing where you compare the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.580" end="00:36:16.940" style="s2">worst forms of science right captured by</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.030" end="00:36:19.550" style="s2">industry interest and simplified causal</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.940" end="00:36:22.190" style="s2">mechanisms and really Bad&#39;s manipulative</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.550" end="00:36:24.290" style="s2">statistics and after genic harm not like</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.190" end="00:36:25.820" style="s2">the worst kind of science you compare</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.290" end="00:36:28.550" style="s2">the worst science to the best most</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.820" end="00:36:30.470" style="s2">sophisticated religious worldviews right</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.550" end="00:36:32.180" style="s2">and then you come at how you silly</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.470" end="00:36:35.510" style="s2">simplistic scientists there&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.180" end="00:36:37.340" style="s2">a bigger story and so either of those</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.510" end="00:36:39.110" style="s2">approaches are wrong right but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.340" end="00:36:41.630" style="s2">what you see in the so-called science</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.110" end="00:36:43.940" style="s2">religion debate which is not really a</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.630" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">debate it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.940" end="00:36:49.460" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get doing this but it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:51.020" style="s2">know and this is again when you when</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.460" end="00:36:55.780" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about religion in schools</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.020" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">now in the United States you&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.780" end="00:37:00.289" style="s2">even given the question like someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.589" style="s2">asking the question they&#39;re asking it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.289" end="00:37:06.490" style="s2">from the presumption of as you began</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.589" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">with like you know the worst of religion</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.490" end="00:37:11.720" style="s2">compared to kind of the best of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:14.359" style="s2">in a rational and scientific I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.720" end="00:37:18.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a little unfair that in fact were</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.359" end="00:37:20.599" style="s2">we to begin to reimagine having</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.470" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">religious discussions within educational</p>

<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:27.980" style="s2">precisely have to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.619" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">sophisticated religious views you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.980" end="00:37:31.039" style="s2">just like if we were gonna bring science</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">in the schools we wouldn&#39;t bring in</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.039" end="00:37:36.559" style="s2">science from the 1890s right we&#39;d bring</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:38.150" style="s2">in the best in science we could so we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.559" end="00:37:41.150" style="s2">want to bring in the best most</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.150" end="00:37:43.970" style="s2">sophisticated articulate religious and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.150" end="00:37:46.940" style="s2">Theological and metaphysical forms of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.970" end="00:37:48.410" style="s2">conversation and it&#39;s just worth noting</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.940" end="00:37:50.569" style="s2">that as someone who studies human</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:02.809" style="s2">religious questions about ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.270" end="00:38:04.309" style="s2">concern this is Paul Tillich&#39;s phrase to</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.809" end="00:38:06.380" style="s2">think about what&#39;s the subject matter of</p>

<p begin="00:38:16.730" end="00:38:23.150" style="s2">to have a place to resolve those forms</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.940" end="00:38:28.010" style="s2">and address those forms of kind of</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.990" end="00:38:41.779" style="s2">is what I speak to in my book a need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.119" end="00:38:44.210" style="s2">rekindle those spaces where we can</p>

<p begin="00:39:32.690" end="00:39:37.820" style="s2">religious language and he believed that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.150" end="00:39:39.410" style="s2">those untapped semantic potentials still</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.820" end="00:39:42.680" style="s2">laid within religious language that they</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.410" end="00:39:45.980" style="s2">provided resources precisely quote to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.680" end="00:39:48.920" style="s2">protect vulnerable forms of community</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.980" end="00:39:50.840" style="s2">life and so when you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.920" end="00:39:53.800" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting like you know death and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.840" end="00:39:57.190" style="s2">dying classically the province of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.800" end="00:39:59.480" style="s2">religion for better and for worse right</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.190" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">so much death and dying goes on in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.480" end="00:40:06.340" style="s2">hospitals now so much death and dying is</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:12.080" style="s2">hidden so much of death and dying is not</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.340" end="00:40:13.640" style="s2">for discussion for display and so this</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.080" end="00:40:15.560" style="s2">has become a vulnerable form of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.640" end="00:40:18.010" style="s2">community life that we make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.560" end="00:40:20.420" style="s2">together about death dying</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.010" end="00:40:22.130" style="s2">and so that would be an example where</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.420" end="00:40:27.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah what what do we say to</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.130" end="00:40:29.780" style="s2">kids about death you know like mm oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.010" end="00:40:33.650" style="s2">then if a kid&#39;s watching the television</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.780" end="00:40:35.300" style="s2">and he sees people talk about war and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.650" end="00:40:36.770" style="s2">knows that there&#39;s nuclear weapons let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.300" end="00:40:38.660" style="s2">say he&#39;s a 10 year old or 13 year old</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.770" end="00:40:41.540" style="s2">and he&#39;s smart and he&#39;s like hey what</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.660" end="00:40:43.430" style="s2">happens when we all blow ourselves up</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.540" end="00:40:45.590" style="s2">and everything&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.430" end="00:40:48.080" style="s2">right and now the kids just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.590" end="00:40:50.540" style="s2">the apocalypse at the dinner table and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.080" end="00:40:54.380" style="s2">so these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.540" end="00:40:58.190" style="s2">and cultures need to have the resources</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.380" end="00:41:00.410" style="s2">to enculturate the next generation into</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.190" end="00:41:03.890" style="s2">reasonable ways of responding to these</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.410" end="00:41:05.870" style="s2">inevitable kind of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.890" end="00:41:08.060" style="s2">thresholds of sense making as part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.870" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">human development jug we want</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.060" end="00:41:12.710" style="s2">adolescents to grapple with the full</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:14.540" style="s2">complexity of their experience right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.710" end="00:41:19.310" style="s2">that includes deep exploration of Who am</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.540" end="00:41:21.770" style="s2">I what is the universe right what is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.310" end="00:41:23.690" style="s2">ultimate goal of being a human of all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.770" end="00:41:27.650" style="s2">this we&#39;re doing all this collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.690" end="00:41:29.450" style="s2">we&#39;re doing why are we doing it so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.650" end="00:41:31.010" style="s2">so that&#39;s a pause there I&#39;ve been just</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.450" end="00:41:33.320" style="s2">talking yeah let me hop in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.010" end="00:41:35.060" style="s2">right first some push back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.320" end="00:41:37.580" style="s2">people listen to the show know that a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.060" end="00:41:40.940" style="s2">push back on religion a fair amount and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.580" end="00:41:41.980" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna do that first I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.940" end="00:41:45.800" style="s2">I buy that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.980" end="00:41:48.020" style="s2">comparing science and religion as sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.800" end="00:41:50.360" style="s2">of two different peas in the same pod is</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.020" end="00:41:53.240" style="s2">very meaningful and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.360" end="00:41:55.610" style="s2">is that science is a bright line in</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.240" end="00:41:57.560" style="s2">history it strikes me in that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.610" end="00:41:59.600" style="s2">actually has built into its own</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.600" end="00:42:03.260" style="s2">mechanism you know you talk about bad</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.580" end="00:42:04.730" style="s2">science and yes there&#39;s been plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.260" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">bad science you know perhaps most</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.730" end="00:42:10.460" style="s2">famously lai cinco ism in Russia or</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:13.580" style="s2">Stalin just decided he didn&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.460" end="00:42:16.040" style="s2">Darwinian style of evolution because it</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.580" end="00:42:19.310" style="s2">somehow contradicted some Marxist idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.040" end="00:42:21.670" style="s2">and he mandated the Lamarckian idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.310" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">you know if you pull on a mouse&#39;s tail</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.670" end="00:42:26.540" style="s2">the offspring will have longer tails or</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:29.150" style="s2">some such and he had a sink of fat</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.540" end="00:42:31.630" style="s2">named Y Cinco in charge of that so but</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.150" end="00:42:33.470" style="s2">over time the inter subjective</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.630" end="00:42:36.470" style="s2">verification of science</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.470" end="00:42:39.290" style="s2">ratchets away bad science and ratchets</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.470" end="00:42:40.700" style="s2">up good science and religion is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.290" end="00:42:43.190" style="s2">like that I mean that&#39;s you know why</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.700" end="00:42:44.840" style="s2">when I had we talk about adolescence is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.190" end="00:42:47.270" style="s2">quite entering perhaps the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.840" end="00:42:51.320" style="s2">important day of my life was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.270" end="00:42:54.260" style="s2">11 years old I was always a sucker for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.320" end="00:42:55.550" style="s2">good complicated story right it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.260" end="00:42:58.820" style="s2">the reasons I&#39;ve read Lord of the Rings</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.550" end="00:43:00.830" style="s2">39 times and I was a good doobie young</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.820" end="00:43:02.180" style="s2">Catholic and read the Bible probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.830" end="00:43:04.280" style="s2">more than the priest thought was healthy</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.180" end="00:43:06.290" style="s2">for me and really thought it was quite a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.280" end="00:43:09.170" style="s2">easing the intricate tales of the Old</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.290" end="00:43:11.480" style="s2">Testament the much simpler stories but</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.170" end="00:43:13.730" style="s2">bigger moral messages of the New</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.480" end="00:43:15.860" style="s2">Testament you know I thought they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.730" end="00:43:18.410" style="s2">kind of cool but as I started learning</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.860" end="00:43:20.120" style="s2">more about science at age 9 and 10 and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.410" end="00:43:21.980" style="s2">by time I was 10 I&#39;d read every book on</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.120" end="00:43:24.110" style="s2">science in the school library and half</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.980" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">the books in the county library</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.110" end="00:43:28.370" style="s2">I started thinking you know something</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:31.190" style="s2">wrong with this stuff I then went and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.370" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">did some research on Islam then called</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.190" end="00:43:37.060" style="s2">Muslims and then Hinduism and read to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:39.950" style="s2">encyclopedia articles on each one and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.060" end="00:43:41.390" style="s2">then I had an epiphany literally almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.950" end="00:43:44.990" style="s2">our religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.390" end="00:43:48.350" style="s2">the light came on screaming religion is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.990" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">a human construct developed to control</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.350" end="00:43:55.190" style="s2">people and it just was like the curtains</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:58.220" style="s2">parted in front of my eyes and to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.190" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">day I hold to that though I will say I</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.220" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">have a more nuanced view which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:06.260" style="s2">initially the religious inspiration of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:08.180" style="s2">religious thinkers may not have been</p>

<p begin="00:44:08.180" end="00:44:11.990" style="s2">think a fair number of them were people</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:14.840" style="s2">with serious mental illnesses but over</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.990" end="00:44:18.230" style="s2">time they inevitably got captured by</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.230" end="00:44:22.570" style="s2">people quite explicitly and because</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.350" end="00:44:25.490" style="s2">there is no inner subjective</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:48.680" style="s2">our daughter says well what about the</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.680" end="00:44:53.270" style="s2">clearly show that the world&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.630" end="00:44:56.330" style="s2">6,000 years old and this was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.270" end="00:44:59.600" style="s2">ultimate religious style answer oh they</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.330" end="00:45:01.820" style="s2">were put there to test our faith mmm you</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.600" end="00:45:04.310" style="s2">know perfect right you know you hear use</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.820" end="00:45:06.920" style="s2">a factual attempt to refute some part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.310" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">that particular sex doctrine which was</p>

<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:15.560" style="s2">fossils but they were put there to test</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.090" end="00:45:18.080" style="s2">our faith and so a world of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.560" end="00:45:20.530" style="s2">people make up ie religion</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.080" end="00:45:23.330" style="s2">that&#39;s not subject to any sort of</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.510" end="00:46:29.660" style="s2">take on them is that those questions are</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.820" end="00:46:32.870" style="s2">very premature we know way too little</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.660" end="00:46:34.670" style="s2">about the universe yet to be thinking we</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.430" end="00:46:50.360" style="s2">like we have some details but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.440" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">couple of big old question marks there</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.360" end="00:46:54.890" style="s2">and even the standard models of physics</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:56.930" style="s2">have gaping holes in them too of what</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.890" end="00:46:59.390" style="s2">you&#39;re called dark energy and dark</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.930" end="00:47:01.580" style="s2">matter which are just statements about</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.180" end="00:47:13.100" style="s2">there&#39;s so much that we don&#39;t know about</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.470" end="00:48:01.170" style="s2">intelligent to spend as much energy and</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.330" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">concerns and aren&#39;t they a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.060" end="00:48:10.580" style="s2">from perhaps the more important road</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.930" style="s2">which is to figure out for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.580" end="00:48:16.280" style="s2">what is the right way to organize</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.930" end="00:48:19.320" style="s2">ourselves as a society and ask people to</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.280" end="00:48:21.450" style="s2">provide a good life and to move humanity</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.320" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">forward so it has as many good options</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.450" end="00:48:28.320" style="s2">as possible yeah I mean it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:30.900" style="s2">you did exactly what I said people do</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.320" end="00:48:34.260" style="s2">which shouldn&#39;t be done which is you</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.900" end="00:48:36.330" style="s2">compare the least generous possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.260" end="00:48:39.150" style="s2">definition of what religion is and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.330" end="00:48:41.510" style="s2">worst possible examples of religious</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.510" end="00:48:47.310" style="s2">versions of science and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.720" end="00:48:49.110" style="s2">examples you gave of course are terrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.310" end="00:48:53.220" style="s2">terrible things happen with religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.110" end="00:48:57.480" style="s2">obviously and biblical literalism as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.220" end="00:49:00.540" style="s2">described it new earthers who won&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.480" end="00:49:01.790" style="s2">at any of the paleontology into logical</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.540" end="00:49:05.550" style="s2">record I mean that&#39;s like your</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.790" end="00:49:08.280" style="s2">stereotypical lowest hanging fruit when</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.550" end="00:49:11.190" style="s2">wanting to say things that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.280" end="00:49:14.550" style="s2">insulting to religious people because</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.190" end="00:49:16.470" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole field of theology</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.550" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">right which like for example Martin</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.470" end="00:49:22.650" style="s2">Luther King got a PhD in studying under</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:25.350" style="s2">Paul Tillich and then you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.650" end="00:49:29.630" style="s2">wisdom traditions across Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.350" end="00:49:33.620" style="s2">Tibetan Buddhism and the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.630" end="00:49:35.970" style="s2">discursive progress in the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.620" end="00:49:39.510" style="s2">religious and theological and ethical</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.970" end="00:49:41.310" style="s2">doctrine across a variety of religious</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.510" end="00:49:44.250" style="s2">traditions right</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.310" end="00:49:48.120" style="s2">and so Juilliard day showed on four</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.250" end="00:49:52.500" style="s2">example very interesting character who</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.120" end="00:49:56.300" style="s2">was a paleontologist and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.500" end="00:49:59.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.300" end="00:50:03.290" style="s2">stereotype and misunderstand religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.790" end="00:50:04.680" style="s2">and confuse it with its worst</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.290" end="00:50:06.060" style="s2">instantiations</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.680" end="00:50:10.170" style="s2">and it&#39;s understandable because some of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.060" end="00:50:13.830" style="s2">them are so appalling especially to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.170" end="00:50:16.110" style="s2">know modern people but simply</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.830" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">understanding religion as something</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.110" end="00:50:19.530" style="s2">that&#39;s a made-up story used to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:22.260" style="s2">control people I&#39;m gonna have to tell</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.530" end="00:50:23.490" style="s2">you that sounds like a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.260" end="00:50:27.540" style="s2">understanding of something that&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.490" end="00:50:30.690" style="s2">rich rich part of human culture since</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.540" end="00:50:33.510" style="s2">there&#39;s been human culture and that this</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.690" end="00:50:35.940" style="s2">science that you loved actually was a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.510" end="00:50:38.010" style="s2">refinement of sentiments that began</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.940" end="00:50:40.410" style="s2">within religious context that had to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.010" end="00:50:43.770" style="s2">with a commitment to truth and a</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.410" end="00:50:45.450" style="s2">commitment to community trust in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.770" end="00:50:49.500" style="s2">variety of things that were actually at</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.450" end="00:50:51.510" style="s2">the backbone of modernity so yes I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.500" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">say to really have a conversation here</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.510" end="00:50:58.290" style="s2">we need to get a sense of sincere</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">grappling with the inter subjective</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.290" end="00:51:02.600" style="s2">components of religious discourse which</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:05.550" style="s2">Ken Wilber speaks do quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.600" end="00:51:06.990" style="s2">characterizing progress within religious</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.550" end="00:51:09.390" style="s2">traditions look just like there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.990" end="00:51:11.660" style="s2">progress within ethical traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.390" end="00:51:14.940" style="s2">progress within scientific traditions</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.660" end="00:51:16.980" style="s2">and that there are different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.940" end="00:51:19.470" style="s2">religious discourse at religious</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.980" end="00:51:21.090" style="s2">engagement different degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.470" end="00:51:24.030" style="s2">maturation within religious</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.090" end="00:51:29.250" style="s2">practitioners in terms of the their</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.030" end="00:51:32.340" style="s2">ability to work with religion as a set</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.250" end="00:51:35.160" style="s2">of practices and beliefs that is always</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.340" end="00:51:37.050" style="s2">evolving and growing so yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.160" end="00:51:41.730" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s kind of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.050" end="00:51:43.770" style="s2">you know this would be me reminding the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.730" end="00:51:46.530" style="s2">scientist that oh yeah isn&#39;t hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.770" end="00:51:49.110" style="s2">science actually become the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.530" end="00:51:51.120" style="s2">controls more people&#39;s lives that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.110" end="00:51:54.210" style="s2">the other control system ever built by</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.120" end="00:51:55.940" style="s2">humans oh yeah it hasn&#39;t science become</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.210" end="00:52:01.349" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.940" end="00:52:05.599" style="s2">massive and damaging Wars and etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.349" end="00:52:07.950" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s like we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:11.880" style="s2">so but instead what I want to think</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.950" end="00:52:16.049" style="s2">about is what you said about the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.880" end="00:52:19.049" style="s2">that the founding of religions actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.049" end="00:52:22.920" style="s2">was had by people with who had</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.049" end="00:52:25.289" style="s2">psychological problems and and so this</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.920" end="00:52:28.440" style="s2">gets down to brass tacks here because</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.289" end="00:52:30.119" style="s2">it&#39;s about the nature of religious</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.440" end="00:52:31.589" style="s2">experience and this is what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.119" end="00:52:35.690" style="s2">grappling with questions of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.589" end="00:52:38.819" style="s2">concern what&#39;s the nature of religious</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.690" end="00:52:42.180" style="s2">experience by the way we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.819" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">all the famous founding scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.180" end="00:52:46.200" style="s2">were crazy but that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:48.029" style="s2">conversation all right so it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.200" end="00:52:49.589" style="s2">say that the beginning of a tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.029" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">problematized because the founder is</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.589" end="00:52:55.710" style="s2">crazy it&#39;s like that&#39;s uh it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:56.940" style="s2">problem the so yesterday the 50 grand</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.710" end="00:52:59.989" style="s2">phone again back to Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.940" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of actually entering the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.989" end="00:53:05.309" style="s2">discourse again which has been going on</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:07.529" style="s2">for many like thousands of years in some</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.309" end="00:53:09.869" style="s2">cases entering the discourse of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.529" end="00:53:12.089" style="s2">religious practitioners and getting a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.869" end="00:53:14.099" style="s2">sense of what are the validity claims</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.089" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">raised within the context of religious</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.099" end="00:53:18.660" style="s2">practice and discourse right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:21.210" style="s2">technical question right just like</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.660" end="00:53:25.190" style="s2">scientists raise claims of truth</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.210" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">facticity etc you know the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.190" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">validity claims raised within religious</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">practice and discourse so in until we</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:37.829" style="s2">can have a sense of what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:39.779" style="s2">and what a legitimate valid sense of</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.829" end="00:53:42.650" style="s2">religiosity and religious experience is</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.779" end="00:53:45.720" style="s2">as compared to a illegitimate irrational</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.650" end="00:53:48.359" style="s2">poorly held religious experience or</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.720" end="00:53:50.279" style="s2">sense of religiosity all right and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.359" end="00:53:51.329" style="s2">just like in science you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.279" end="00:53:54.059" style="s2">distinction between oh there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.329" end="00:53:57.509" style="s2">signs and bad science right what you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.059" end="00:54:00.210" style="s2">were doing in religious worlds in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.509" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">worlds of emerging spirituality right</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.210" end="00:54:04.320" style="s2">you can make a comparable distinction</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:06.600" style="s2">you can sort the good from the bad in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.320" end="00:54:08.310" style="s2">these domains and so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.600" end="00:54:10.290" style="s2">step is figuring out how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.310" end="00:54:11.460" style="s2">just like with science right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.290" end="00:54:13.320" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s good and bad science</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.460" end="00:54:17.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to tell the difference and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.320" end="00:54:20.160" style="s2">just like in religious communities of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.340" end="00:54:21.330" style="s2">practice and discourse there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.160" end="00:54:23.430" style="s2">tell the difference between those that</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.330" end="00:54:27.750" style="s2">are pathological and those that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.430" end="00:54:30.060" style="s2">actually healthy and you know in again</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.750" end="00:54:32.550" style="s2">protecting vulnerable forms of community</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.060" end="00:54:36.090" style="s2">life from encroachment by the control</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.550" end="00:54:36.900" style="s2">system of science right the meta you</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.090" end="00:54:38.280" style="s2">remember we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.900" end="00:54:40.260" style="s2">medicalization of academic</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.280" end="00:54:43.020" style="s2">underperformance can also talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.260" end="00:54:46.200" style="s2">medicalization of death and so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.020" end="00:54:48.750" style="s2">example where how do we preserve the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.200" end="00:54:51.240" style="s2">remnants of the life world from</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.750" end="00:54:53.100" style="s2">colonization by the largest control</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.100" end="00:54:57.420" style="s2">science one way to do that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:55:01.140" style="s2">leverage this whole other lineage of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.420" end="00:55:04.470" style="s2">human thought and cooperation and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.140" end="00:55:05.820" style="s2">not saying we are all going to the worst</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.470" end="00:55:09.420" style="s2">parts of religion ever I&#39;m saying we</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.820" end="00:55:11.820" style="s2">actually have to find the best refine it</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.420" end="00:55:14.700" style="s2">and actually turn it into something that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.820" end="00:55:16.230" style="s2">is a growing and vibrant part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.700" end="00:55:18.600" style="s2">culture instead of something that feels</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.230" end="00:55:21.450" style="s2">like a pre-modern remnant that&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.600" end="00:55:23.670" style="s2">on and so yeah so there&#39;s first need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.450" end="00:55:24.900" style="s2">even get into the science religion thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.670" end="00:55:27.900" style="s2">and even think about what it would mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.900" end="00:55:30.570" style="s2">to move religious and metaphysical and</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.900" end="00:55:32.340" style="s2">spiritual conversations into some kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.570" end="00:55:34.590" style="s2">of reasonable space within the education</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.340" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">field we need to slow down and when</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.590" end="00:55:40.170" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about well what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:42.450" style="s2">religion and what is science and come</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.170" end="00:55:43.710" style="s2">with the best of both of them instead of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.450" end="00:55:47.100" style="s2">the best of one and the worst of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.710" end="00:55:49.320" style="s2">other and again the spirituality people</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.100" end="00:55:52.440" style="s2">and religious people do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.320" end="00:55:54.780" style="s2">dismissing science entirely right moving</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.440" end="00:55:56.520" style="s2">into some weird post truth discourse</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.780" end="00:55:59.370" style="s2">that makes it so that there are no such</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.520" end="00:56:01.080" style="s2">thing as even physical bodies and crap</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.370" end="00:56:04.530" style="s2">like that right so there&#39;s there&#39;s nutty</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.080" end="00:56:08.940" style="s2">stuff and there&#39;s no denying it but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.530" end="00:56:10.560" style="s2">think to have a as dismissive of view of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.940" end="00:56:11.850" style="s2">it as you did I feel like it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.560" end="00:56:13.980" style="s2">conversation a non-starter</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.850" end="00:56:16.050" style="s2">you know it makes it so that it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:58:45.720" end="00:58:49.260" style="s2">anything therefore we shouldn&#39;t even be</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.320" end="00:58:58.470" style="s2">make concern right and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.270" end="00:59:00.090" style="s2">things you mentioned we didn&#39;t know were</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.470" end="00:59:02.070" style="s2">things done in the physical universe</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.090" end="00:59:03.810" style="s2">events within the physical universe that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.070" end="00:59:06.150" style="s2">we&#39;re not aware of but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.810" end="00:59:09.320" style="s2">that we do know or maybe we don&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.150" end="00:59:11.820" style="s2">so I know I love my wife I just know it</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.320" end="00:59:14.940" style="s2">all right and I know that love is</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.820" end="00:59:18.450" style="s2">valuable I just know it and so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.940" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">question of like well actually Zak we</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.450" end="00:59:22.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that love is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:25.740" style="s2">you&#39;re just a meat machine designed by</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.680" end="00:59:28.470" style="s2">completely indifferent but mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.740" end="00:59:31.220" style="s2">and causal processes of a</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.220" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">universe and it may be that your love</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.050" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">for your wife is completely meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:41.100" style="s2">hmm you&#39;re definitely not going to build</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:42.630" style="s2">a civilization on that idea right you</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.100" end="00:59:45.810" style="s2">could probably build a civilization on</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.630" end="00:59:47.130" style="s2">the idea that love is meaningful and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.810" end="00:59:48.360" style="s2">there&#39;s this question of again when we</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.130" end="00:59:49.860" style="s2">talk about what we don&#39;t know and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.360" end="00:59:53.160" style="s2">talk about matters of ultimate concern</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.860" end="00:59:54.750" style="s2">I&#39;m not really super it&#39;s not even super</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.160" end="00:59:56.700" style="s2">clear to me that like dark matter is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.750" end="00:59:58.890" style="s2">topic of ultimate concern that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.700" end="01:00:00.750" style="s2">me to be an artifact of contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.890" end="01:00:04.770" style="s2">physics and it could end up being it</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.750" end="01:00:07.110" style="s2">poorly conceived set of basic axiomatic</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.770" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">things within physics for all we know so</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.110" end="01:00:09.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s not what I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:13.530" style="s2">talking about actually is the love for</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.960" end="01:00:14.930" style="s2">my wife valuable right like is Mother</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.530" end="01:00:18.210" style="s2">Teresa better than Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.930" end="01:00:19.500" style="s2">right on most days probably but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.210" end="01:00:21.000" style="s2">there are some days when that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.500" end="01:00:25.140" style="s2">apparently she was quite a bitch when</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.000" end="01:00:27.390" style="s2">she wanted to be right yeah obviously if</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.140" end="01:00:29.220" style="s2">we back ourselves into an ideological</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.390" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">Cornette where we&#39;re like yeah she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.220" end="01:00:34.440" style="s2">better than Hitler but not ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:37.020" style="s2">because ultimately were just mechanical</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.440" end="01:00:40.020" style="s2">meat machines with notes like oops like</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.020" end="01:00:44.330" style="s2">there&#39;s certain</p>

<p begin="01:00:52.410" end="01:00:58.530" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a certain form that</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:01:00.660" style="s2">scientific argumentation can take where</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.530" end="01:01:03.240" style="s2">it begins to undermine through its own</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:25.020" style="s2">dinner table like yeah well I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.710" end="01:01:27.750" style="s2">really punish you for going out last</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.020" end="01:01:29.190" style="s2">night because you&#39;re actually not</p>

<p begin="01:01:37.290" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">I guess you&#39;re not grounded like what</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.650" end="01:01:47.190" style="s2">are the conditions for the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:50.100" style="s2">of actually morally binding human</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.190" end="01:01:52.320" style="s2">relationships right and at what point</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.100" end="01:01:54.270" style="s2">does the premium put by science on cap</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.320" end="01:01:56.790" style="s2">on counter intuitive explanations of</p>

<p begin="01:02:02.490" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">the crazy reductionist view oh yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.920" end="01:02:09.840" style="s2">know in some level of thinking you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:12.510" style="s2">argue that you are a causal machine is</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.840" end="01:02:13.350" style="s2">just not useful right turns out not to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.510" end="01:02:15.960" style="s2">be useful</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.350" end="01:02:17.610" style="s2">I had Jessica flack on the show not too</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.960" end="01:02:21.060" style="s2">long ago from the Santa Fe Institute she</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.610" end="01:02:23.490" style="s2">did a great job of describing how</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.060" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">freewill is real but it operates at a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.490" end="01:02:28.200" style="s2">much higher level of emergence than is</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:31.110" style="s2">even visible to the ultra reductionist</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.200" end="01:02:33.480" style="s2">level and was pretty convincing about it</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.110" end="01:02:35.400" style="s2">but frankly from my perspective even</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.480" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">more to the point whether we have free</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.400" end="01:02:40.260" style="s2">will or not in any given particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:42.660" style="s2">scientific lens is relatively immaterial</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.260" end="01:02:45.390" style="s2">what is important is that to build a</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.660" end="01:02:47.850" style="s2">society that works we have to act as if</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.390" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">at least we have free will we know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.850" end="01:02:51.060" style="s2">right that nihilism is the road to</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:53.410" style="s2">nothingness</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.060" end="01:02:56.080" style="s2">solipsism is no better</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.410" end="01:02:58.150" style="s2">for the opposite reason and that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.080" end="01:03:00.040" style="s2">know my touch word is always is it</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.150" end="01:03:01.360" style="s2">useful and it&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.040" end="01:03:04.030" style="s2">mentioned Verve a key right you know a</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.360" end="01:03:06.820" style="s2">verb a key is a self stated atheist and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.030" end="01:03:09.040" style="s2">his perspective is what we really need</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.820" end="01:03:10.480" style="s2">is the religion that is not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.040" end="01:03:12.070" style="s2">and this is you know this gets back to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:14.830" style="s2">this concept that we&#39;re talking around</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.070" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">here that it provides a binding energy</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.830" end="01:03:22.150" style="s2">for us as a society it&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:25.750" style="s2">all agree to treasure right and to live</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.150" end="01:03:27.160" style="s2">by these concepts irrespective of</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.750" end="01:03:29.020" style="s2">whether they are grounded in any</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.160" end="01:03:31.210" style="s2">ultimate concern for instance the fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.020" end="01:03:33.100" style="s2">that you love your wife I guarantee your</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.210" end="01:03:34.360" style="s2">marriage is a lot better because you</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.100" end="01:03:36.130" style="s2">love your wife and more to the point</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.360" end="01:03:37.780" style="s2">that you believe your love your wife and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.130" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">that from time to time you even express</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.780" end="01:03:43.210" style="s2">that radical thought then if you did the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:45.250" style="s2">opposite so that it is useful whether</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.210" end="01:03:47.770" style="s2">that&#39;s in any way tied up with ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.250" end="01:03:50.890" style="s2">concerns I have no idea you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.770" end="01:03:54.310" style="s2">even know how one would tie that level</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.890" end="01:03:58.270" style="s2">of essentially useful sociological</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.310" end="01:04:01.000" style="s2">anthropological behavior to something as</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.270" end="01:04:03.910" style="s2">potentially distant as the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.000" end="01:04:06.940" style="s2">concerns of why the universe exists and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.910" end="01:04:10.300" style="s2">what our point and it is I would point</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.940" end="01:04:13.450" style="s2">back to there is clearly a need for</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.300" end="01:04:16.570" style="s2">something that religion in the past has</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.450" end="01:04:18.460" style="s2">fulfilled but it&#39;s not at all clear to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.570" end="01:04:21.100" style="s2">me that it&#39;s what we need going forward</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.460" end="01:04:24.730" style="s2">in Verbeck is actually a very articulate</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.100" end="01:04:26.470" style="s2">spokesman for that perspective I should</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.730" end="01:04:28.540" style="s2">also add of course that I&#39;m not actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.470" end="01:04:30.220" style="s2">as bad at philistine as I sometimes come</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.540" end="01:04:32.260" style="s2">across on this topic you know I have</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.220" end="01:04:34.150" style="s2">read a fair amount of Buddhism went</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.260" end="01:04:37.180" style="s2">through my Alan Watts phase at one point</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.150" end="01:04:38.770" style="s2">read other thinkers on the topic read a</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.190" end="01:04:56.050" style="s2">yeah read a sociable God too which is my</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.710" end="01:04:57.400" style="s2">favorite came over book where he talks</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.050" end="01:04:59.950" style="s2">about these distinctions between</p>

<p begin="01:05:01.859" end="01:05:06.900" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s interesting so my no I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.859" end="01:05:08.999" style="s2">mean my mom was traumatized by Catholic</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.900" end="01:05:11.849" style="s2">school you know and it&#39;s kind of like I</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.999" end="01:05:12.809" style="s2">think there are generational dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.849" end="01:05:17.660" style="s2">here as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.809" end="01:05:20.279" style="s2">the post-war American Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.660" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">seemed to be particularly traumatizing</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.279" end="01:05:27.299" style="s2">and drove a lot of people I think in two</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:29.700" style="s2">forms of scientism and materialism that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.299" end="01:05:32.609" style="s2">may not have actually become so drastic</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.700" end="01:05:35.369" style="s2">had they had different contexts of</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.609" end="01:05:37.499" style="s2">socialization in which to think about</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.369" end="01:05:40.349" style="s2">these kind of deeper questions you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.499" end="01:05:42.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yeah again we would end up</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.349" end="01:05:46.229" style="s2">getting into a philosophical debate here</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.719" end="01:05:50.400" style="s2">but the idea that love for my wife is</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.229" end="01:05:53.130" style="s2">useful mmm that&#39;s phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.400" end="01:05:56.819" style="s2">doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t land well right that in</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.130" end="01:05:59.400" style="s2">fact if Megan believes that I love her</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.819" end="01:06:00.989" style="s2">simply because it makes our mean we</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.400" end="01:06:03.690" style="s2">fight less maybe that&#39;s what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.989" end="01:06:05.519" style="s2">effective marriage and so we&#39;re again</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.690" end="01:06:08.579" style="s2">we&#39;re like postponing the question of</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.519" end="01:06:11.099" style="s2">what the good is so it&#39;s like a love is</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.579" end="01:06:14.609" style="s2">useful for the marriage but you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.099" end="01:06:18.180" style="s2">that we&#39;ve made we&#39;ve undercut the</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.609" end="01:06:20.910" style="s2">actual meaning of love which is that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.180" end="01:06:23.519" style="s2">give it freely for its own sake right</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.910" end="01:06:25.799" style="s2">that I&#39;m not instrumentalizing it and</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.519" end="01:06:27.630" style="s2">using you through displays of love to</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.799" end="01:06:28.859" style="s2">make the marriage go efficiently but</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.630" end="01:06:30.059" style="s2">even then it&#39;s like well what makes a</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.859" end="01:06:32.430" style="s2">good marriage just one where we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:06:32.430" end="01:06:37.019" style="s2">of like mmm much deeper than that we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.579" end="01:06:39.979" style="s2">again we could spend two hours talking</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.019" end="01:06:43.589" style="s2">about how we are animals who have</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.979" end="01:06:47.190" style="s2">regulatory systems of you know oxytocin</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.589" end="01:06:50.640" style="s2">and other neuromodulators and something</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.190" end="01:06:52.890" style="s2">like love is imprinted in our neural</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.640" end="01:06:56.099" style="s2">makeup that causes when we feel like</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.890" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">we&#39;re loved oxytocin to be released and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.099" end="01:07:00.390" style="s2">that those are binding energies that</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:02.430" style="s2">help a relationship survive ups and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.390" end="01:07:04.289" style="s2">downs you know so there&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.430" end="01:07:07.019" style="s2">like we could go out for out an hour at</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.289" end="01:07:09.150" style="s2">least on that topic alone but let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.019" end="01:07:11.130" style="s2">out here we&#39;ll agree that at least at</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.150" end="01:07:12.630" style="s2">this point we have a somewhat different</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.130" end="01:07:14.039" style="s2">perspective on this because I do want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.630" end="01:07:15.540" style="s2">get to some of your other interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.039" end="01:07:18.210" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.540" end="01:07:20.370" style="s2">about religion which is that we in the</p>

<p begin="01:07:20.370" end="01:07:27.270" style="s2">started to say have now a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.340" end="01:07:29.160" style="s2">things that are religion or spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.270" end="01:07:32.490" style="s2">and in fact you described it as the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.160" end="01:07:34.590" style="s2">postmodern spiritual marketplace talk a</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.490" end="01:07:36.570" style="s2">little bit about this marketplace and in</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.590" end="01:07:39.510" style="s2">particular you go on it quite eloquently</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.570" end="01:07:41.580" style="s2">about the role that teacher li authority</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.510" end="01:07:44.940" style="s2">can serve in this marketplace both for</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.580" end="01:07:46.260" style="s2">good and maybe not so good right and</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.940" end="01:07:48.000" style="s2">this is the crux of the matter really</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.260" end="01:07:50.070" style="s2">with your concerns about religion you</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:55.310" style="s2">know like with the Protestant</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.070" end="01:07:58.220" style="s2">Reformation you had a fragmentation of</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.310" end="01:08:00.240" style="s2">what used to be completely centralized</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.220" end="01:08:02.760" style="s2">dictate of religious teacher the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.240" end="01:08:06.120" style="s2">authority from the Pope right and so you</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.760" end="01:08:09.180" style="s2">get the Protestant kind of revolt</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.120" end="01:08:11.130" style="s2">against a particular form of what</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.180" end="01:08:14.910" style="s2">religions going to look like and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.130" end="01:08:17.730" style="s2">you get all of these emergent Christian</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.910" end="01:08:21.390" style="s2">groups right and a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.730" end="01:08:25.350" style="s2">follow from that fast-forward to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.390" end="01:08:29.220" style="s2">after the end of World War two you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.350" end="01:08:31.620" style="s2">a country in which that basic ethos of</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.220" end="01:08:35.010" style="s2">let a bunch of different religious</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.620" end="01:08:36.870" style="s2">flowers bloom decentralized religious</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.010" end="01:08:39.240" style="s2">teacher lee authority and make it so</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.870" end="01:08:41.760" style="s2">that basically any farm boy who&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.240" end="01:08:44.310" style="s2">Bible he can start thumping can start a</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.760" end="01:08:47.790" style="s2">church right and you get the beginnings</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.310" end="01:08:49.950" style="s2">of what is now this new-age spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.790" end="01:08:51.480" style="s2">marketplace after the civil war there</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.950" end="01:08:54.870" style="s2">were several great awakenings</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.480" end="01:08:57.120" style="s2">one even before that with Jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.870" end="01:08:59.310" style="s2">Edwards starting in Northampton I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.120" end="01:09:00.810" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember the exact dates but</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.310" end="01:09:03.780" style="s2">there were two Great Awakening us in</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.810" end="01:09:05.370" style="s2">early American history and then after</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.780" end="01:09:07.140" style="s2">World War two you get another kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.370" end="01:09:10.799" style="s2">Great Awakening but it had to do with an</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.140" end="01:09:14.309" style="s2">influx of non-christian religious &#39;ti</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.799" end="01:09:16.139" style="s2">into mainstream America</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.309" end="01:09:18.119" style="s2">understand it was America that was</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.139" end="01:09:19.710" style="s2">already fragmented in terms of the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.119" end="01:09:21.960" style="s2">to understood teach really Authority in</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.710" end="01:09:24.989" style="s2">general and beginning to fragment all</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.960" end="01:09:28.109" style="s2">forms of authority because it basically</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.989" end="01:09:29.789" style="s2">you know the McLuhan desk shift into</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.109" end="01:09:32.069" style="s2">these forms of mass media that were</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.789" end="01:09:34.139" style="s2">occurring at the same time and so began</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.069" end="01:09:37.469" style="s2">the sixties move through the eighties</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.139" end="01:09:41.219" style="s2">and now we&#39;re seeing in our in the past</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.469" end="01:09:45.389" style="s2">two decades of flowering I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.219" end="01:09:48.539" style="s2">almost unprecedented of new religious</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.389" end="01:09:51.299" style="s2">movements and forms of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.539" end="01:09:54.480" style="s2">synthesized and eclectic religious</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.299" end="01:09:57.079" style="s2">belief and practices where you get some</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.480" end="01:09:59.550" style="s2">individual from New York City who is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.079" end="01:10:04.110" style="s2">doing Buddhist meditation but doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.550" end="01:10:07.530" style="s2">Hindu yoga who celebrates Christmas with</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.110" end="01:10:10.500" style="s2">their parents and then claims to not</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.530" end="01:10:13.369" style="s2">belong to any religion but you reach the</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.500" end="01:10:16.679" style="s2">your entre book and beliefs and Aliens</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.369" end="01:10:18.329" style="s2">right so like okay like that&#39;s an imp</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.679" end="01:10:20.070" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting like pretty common</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.329" end="01:10:23.420" style="s2">actually I think I know that guy right</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.070" end="01:10:26.340" style="s2">right so yeah so you have this radical</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.420" end="01:10:28.469" style="s2">eclecticism in the United States for a</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.340" end="01:10:32.070" style="s2">long time that regards to what counts as</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.469" end="01:10:34.860" style="s2">a legitimate religious teaching and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.070" end="01:10:36.539" style="s2">you throw into that in opening a</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.860" end="01:10:38.760" style="s2">basically an educational market place</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.539" end="01:10:40.650" style="s2">for religious teachings and teachers and</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.760" end="01:10:43.980" style="s2">religious practices and that thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.650" end="01:10:46.349" style="s2">blooms and blossoms and so now you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.980" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">if you wanted to and had a ton of money</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.349" end="01:10:54.000" style="s2">you could spend all your time consuming</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:57.630" style="s2">one form of spiritual practice or</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.000" end="01:11:01.050" style="s2">religious ceremony or teaching or</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.630" end="01:11:03.780" style="s2">another I mean there&#39;s just so much and</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.050" end="01:11:05.659" style="s2">so New Age doesn&#39;t even capture it</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.780" end="01:11:10.110" style="s2">because a lot of this stuff is actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.659" end="01:11:13.340" style="s2">legit you know religious lineage holders</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.110" end="01:11:17.039" style="s2">like from Tibetan Buddhism or gurus and</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.340" end="01:11:18.780" style="s2">Hinduism they you know monks who lead</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.039" end="01:11:20.190" style="s2">contemplative prayer retreats in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.780" end="01:11:22.230" style="s2">Berkshires I mean there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.190" end="01:11:23.250" style="s2">that&#39;s possible and so well when you see</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.230" end="01:11:24.300" style="s2">a marketplace like this in any</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.250" end="01:11:26.120" style="s2">marketplace it was like well what the</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.300" end="01:11:30.180" style="s2">hell is quality control</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.120" end="01:11:31.920" style="s2">right how do we regulate the goods for</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.180" end="01:11:33.390" style="s2">sale on this marketplace right because</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.920" end="01:11:34.800" style="s2">this is potentially dangerous stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.390" end="01:11:36.570" style="s2">this is stuff that you start Colts worth</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.800" end="01:11:39.390" style="s2">and by the way more more and more</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.570" end="01:11:42.090" style="s2">cultures for hanging up these days and</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.390" end="01:11:45.090" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the dynamic of this kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.090" end="01:11:46.740" style="s2">of marketplace of religious ideas so I</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.090" end="01:11:48.990" style="s2">asked a basic question when I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.740" end="01:11:50.520" style="s2">working in the integral scene with</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.990" end="01:11:52.950" style="s2">Wilbur and Gaffney and others and it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.520" end="01:11:55.620" style="s2">like yeah how would we exercise quality</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.950" end="01:11:58.170" style="s2">control in this spiritual marketplace</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.620" end="01:12:00.030" style="s2">and it ends up being an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.170" end="01:12:01.500" style="s2">question because it you have to put your</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.030" end="01:12:02.580" style="s2">finger directly on the question that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.500" end="01:12:05.310" style="s2">were already raising when you were</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.580" end="01:12:07.620" style="s2">critiquing religion so much it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.310" end="01:12:09.060" style="s2">that well what the hell how do they</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.620" end="01:12:10.980" style="s2">already make that argument that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.060" end="01:12:14.070" style="s2">terrible argument or on whose authority</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.980" end="01:12:15.960" style="s2">do you say that all right and what about</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.070" end="01:12:17.910" style="s2">the authority of science visa vie your</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.960" end="01:12:21.750" style="s2">so-called authority from the Bible so it</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.910" end="01:12:24.750" style="s2">ends up being this basic how we do</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.750" end="01:12:26.550" style="s2">dishes with the consumption of religious</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.750" end="01:12:29.910" style="s2">goods you know you propose one really</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.550" end="01:12:32.460" style="s2">useful criteria of quality control in</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.910" end="01:12:35.940" style="s2">the marketplace of religious ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.460" end="01:12:37.530" style="s2">these ideas useful at all right do they</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.940" end="01:12:40.950" style="s2">help us do the things we need to do as</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.530" end="01:12:45.390" style="s2">people right or are these ideas actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.950" end="01:12:47.190" style="s2">not useful distracting extractive right</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.390" end="01:12:49.800" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously just done to make a</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.190" end="01:12:53.250" style="s2">buck or to confuse us enough of them we</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.800" end="01:12:55.740" style="s2">can be manipulated and etc so I love</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.250" end="01:12:58.470" style="s2">your criteria of usefulness but there</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.740" end="01:13:01.590" style="s2">are other ones I speak to it you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.470" end="01:13:03.750" style="s2">someone at length in the book pulling</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.590" end="01:13:06.120" style="s2">upon Ken&#39;s work and the work of other</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.750" end="01:13:11.610" style="s2">people who have thought long and hard</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.120" end="01:13:13.560" style="s2">about you know the way again communities</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.610" end="01:13:16.140" style="s2">of religious discourse and practice have</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.560" end="01:13:17.760" style="s2">worked for millennia and then thinking</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.140" end="01:13:19.950" style="s2">about the transformations that set in</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.760" end="01:13:22.470" style="s2">with modernity and looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.950" end="01:13:25.290" style="s2">emerging kind of non institutionalized</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.470" end="01:13:27.390" style="s2">religious forms that are innovating with</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.290" end="01:13:28.620" style="s2">religious discourse on practice just</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.390" end="01:13:32.970" style="s2">look across all three of those because</p>

<p begin="01:16:09.620" end="01:16:14.850" style="s2">religions so that&#39;s just interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.020" end="01:16:16.980" style="s2">kind of throw in the mix there which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.850" end="01:16:20.190" style="s2">that you know just like you can distill</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.980" end="01:16:22.230" style="s2">science so you know into some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.190" end="01:16:25.680" style="s2">very universal process which can be</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.230" end="01:16:27.390" style="s2">applied to biology and physics and even</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.680" end="01:16:29.820" style="s2">certain realms in psychology and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.390" end="01:16:32.460" style="s2">like a universal underlying structure or</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.820" end="01:16:36.270" style="s2">way of doing justification of legitimacy</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.460" end="01:16:38.610" style="s2">of validity claims so with religion</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.270" end="01:16:40.230" style="s2">there ends up being some deeper</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.610" end="01:16:42.000" style="s2">structure and this is what were vague is</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.230" end="01:16:45.990" style="s2">trying to get at some deeper structure</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.000" end="01:16:48.260" style="s2">that allows us to discuss and redeem</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.990" end="01:16:50.610" style="s2">validity claims in the domain of</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.260" end="01:16:52.800" style="s2">religion which again is a domain of</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.610" end="01:16:55.470" style="s2">those things that are of ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.800" end="01:16:57.000" style="s2">concern well we got let&#39;s you know again</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.470" end="01:16:58.920" style="s2">we can talk about this one for two hours</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.000" end="01:17:00.720" style="s2">but there&#39;s one last topic I&#39;d really</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.920" end="01:17:02.640" style="s2">like to get to well actually before we</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.720" end="01:17:05.610" style="s2">do that I&#39;m gonna steal three minutes</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.640" end="01:17:08.250" style="s2">from our last topic you did write about</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.610" end="01:17:10.980" style="s2">one I guess he&#39;s religious I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.250" end="01:17:13.050" style="s2">hundred sure that actually struck me is</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.980" end="01:17:16.680" style="s2">worth digging into somebody named Mark</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.050" end="01:17:18.420" style="s2">Gaffney and his unique self theory at</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.680" end="01:17:21.030" style="s2">least as you described it it actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.420" end="01:17:23.580" style="s2">sounded like it might be useful could</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.030" end="01:17:25.020" style="s2">you give us a minute or two keeping in</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.580" end="01:17:28.590" style="s2">mind that we really do want to get to</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.020" end="01:17:32.130" style="s2">our thirteen miracles about Mark Gaffney</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.590" end="01:17:34.560" style="s2">and his unique self theory totally yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.130" end="01:17:37.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working with Mark for years</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:40.710" style="s2">and he&#39;s worked with ken and myself and</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.940" end="01:17:43.160" style="s2">you know marks a complicated and</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.710" end="01:17:47.310" style="s2">important figure within the contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.160" end="01:17:50.430" style="s2">spiritual marketplace he had in Israel</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.310" end="01:17:53.220" style="s2">for a time a large religious community</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.430" end="01:17:58.290" style="s2">and for a time the long ago the most</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.220" end="01:18:01.960" style="s2">popular show on Israeli TV and he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.290" end="01:18:04.510" style="s2">subject to political scandal and smear</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.960" end="01:18:07.300" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a lot of controversy</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.510" end="01:18:09.730" style="s2">about his character myself like Clint</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.300" end="01:18:13.270" style="s2">Foose and Ken and a few other people</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.730" end="01:18:15.190" style="s2">have stuck by mark despite that which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.270" end="01:18:16.840" style="s2">to say that the integrity of mark&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.190" end="01:18:18.160" style="s2">thinking and character shines through</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.840" end="01:18:21.280" style="s2">and especially in this concept like</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.160" end="01:18:24.850" style="s2">unique self theory and so the basic idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.280" end="01:18:28.360" style="s2">here is that you know if you if you look</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.850" end="01:18:30.520" style="s2">at the core of what&#39;s taught in variety</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.360" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">of religious traditions you get this</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.520" end="01:18:34.270" style="s2">move and this is true in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:36.400" style="s2">monotheistic let&#39;s call it that way and</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.270" end="01:18:39.340" style="s2">Christianity Judaism you also it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.400" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">true and Buddhism and Hinduism where</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.340" end="01:18:44.800" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something like self with</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:48.250" style="s2">a little s right which is like Zack with</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.800" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">all this petty neurotic concerns but</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.250" end="01:18:54.370" style="s2">sometimes if you do a lot of meditation</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:18:57.670" style="s2">or tragedy occurs or something else kind</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.370" end="01:19:00.850" style="s2">of breaks the little Zack out of his</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.670" end="01:19:03.420" style="s2">comfort there&#39;s an actual revelation in</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.850" end="01:19:05.320" style="s2">one&#39;s own experience which say if</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.420" end="01:19:08.710" style="s2">phenomenologically it&#39;s just there an</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.320" end="01:19:12.310" style="s2">experience of like whoa self with a</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.710" end="01:19:15.040" style="s2">capital S that there is a consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.310" end="01:19:19.000" style="s2">that&#39;s larger than little zack which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.040" end="01:19:20.410" style="s2">kind of weaves zack into the fabric of</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.000" end="01:19:21.940" style="s2">everything and so this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.410" end="01:19:23.860" style="s2">experience you might have on a</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.940" end="01:19:25.210" style="s2">meditation retreat or sometimes people</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.860" end="01:19:28.120" style="s2">get it doing a lot of drugs where</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.210" end="01:19:30.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of like whoa my previous</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.120" end="01:19:34.030" style="s2">experience of self was completely</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.790" end="01:19:37.540" style="s2">limited and tiny I am actually something</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.030" end="01:19:39.489" style="s2">more like all things that&#39;s self</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.540" end="01:19:40.780" style="s2">capitalist this is your classic sense of</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.489" end="01:19:43.060" style="s2">what enlightenment is right that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.780" end="01:19:45.400" style="s2">notion the classic like neo and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.060" end="01:19:47.080" style="s2">matrix like whoa like and he&#39;s seeing</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.400" end="01:19:48.730" style="s2">all of the code of everything in his</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.080" end="01:19:52.420" style="s2">inter a relation with everything and</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.730" end="01:19:54.580" style="s2">that gets all one now the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.420" end="01:19:57.520" style="s2">that that&#39;s not a useful idea from your</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.580" end="01:20:01.510" style="s2">perspective like it&#39;s a relieving idea</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.520" end="01:20:04.270" style="s2">right which is to say that it is sotiria</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.510" end="01:20:06.820" style="s2">logically potent it relieves the self</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.270" end="01:20:10.360" style="s2">from its suffering and brings the self</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.820" end="01:20:13.540" style="s2">up into a much larger frame so that Zack</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.360" end="01:20:14.770" style="s2">would be relieved of fear of death Zach</p>

<p begin="01:20:19.869" end="01:20:24.460" style="s2">Essen this is what you hear in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.000" end="01:20:25.900" style="s2">Buddhism and a lot of new-age discussion</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.460" end="01:20:27.840" style="s2">and a lot of discussions from about</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.900" end="01:20:29.949" style="s2">Avanti Vedanta and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.840" end="01:20:32.139" style="s2">other religious traditions that</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.949" end="01:20:33.989" style="s2">emphasize leaving the personal behind</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.139" end="01:20:36.219" style="s2">and moving to the impersonal big-ass</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.989" end="01:20:38.080" style="s2">unique self theory proposes that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.219" end="01:20:40.270" style="s2">actually another turn this is a fully</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.080" end="01:20:44.380" style="s2">non dual way of thinking about religious</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.270" end="01:20:46.750" style="s2">experience which is that yeah but even</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.380" end="01:20:50.949" style="s2">after you&#39;ve had that experience of true</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.750" end="01:20:53.340" style="s2">self you are still within a unique</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.949" end="01:20:56.159" style="s2">position and context with unique</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.340" end="01:21:00.150" style="s2">proclivities and potentialities and</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.159" end="01:21:03.850" style="s2">relationships so that it&#39;s not that all</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.150" end="01:21:06.580" style="s2">differences are kind of like eclipse in</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.850" end="01:21:09.280" style="s2">the glory of oneness now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.580" end="01:21:11.590" style="s2">temporary state experience on the other</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.280" end="01:21:13.929" style="s2">side of that there&#39;s a return to</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.590" end="01:21:15.699" style="s2">individuation on the other side of ego</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.929" end="01:21:17.739" style="s2">and this is what Maslow sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.699" end="01:21:20.500" style="s2">sometimes called the self transcending</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.739" end="01:21:22.270" style="s2">right so you see the small Zac you</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.500" end="01:21:24.010" style="s2">transcend the small Zac and touch the</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.270" end="01:21:26.860" style="s2">big self and then you return to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.010" end="01:21:31.210" style="s2">uniqueness of who you are where you are</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.860" end="01:21:33.969" style="s2">when you are now here uniquely just this</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.210" end="01:21:35.619" style="s2">right so that&#39;s the non dual realization</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.969" end="01:21:37.449" style="s2">where enlightenment doesn&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.619" end="01:21:39.940" style="s2">something you can only do on the cushion</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.449" end="01:21:42.699" style="s2">with your eyes closed then in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.940" end="01:21:46.239" style="s2">a commitment to consistently act from</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.699" end="01:21:49.989" style="s2">the place that is uniquely yours act</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.239" end="01:21:54.400" style="s2">from but beyond your particular</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.989" end="01:21:56.770" style="s2">attachments to little Zach alright so</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.400" end="01:22:00.730" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a way of thinking differently</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.770" end="01:22:02.440" style="s2">about what is being offered from some of</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.730" end="01:22:07.179" style="s2">these meditative traditions which can be</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.440" end="01:22:10.210" style="s2">misread as a retreat from the world into</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.179" end="01:22:11.800" style="s2">the big s right the big self everyone</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.210" end="01:22:14.530" style="s2">kind of like relieve themselves of</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.800" end="01:22:17.110" style="s2">responsibility and disappear into kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.530" end="01:22:19.150" style="s2">of like a amorphous oneness with all</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.110" end="01:22:20.960" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.150" end="01:22:25.470" style="s2">stereotypical view of many</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.960" end="01:22:27.090" style="s2">traditions and what unique self theory</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.470" end="01:22:30.270" style="s2">says is that and that&#39;s you haven&#39;t gone</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.090" end="01:22:32.790" style="s2">fully through and you&#39;ve ended up kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.270" end="01:22:36.960" style="s2">of like checking out when what you need</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.790" end="01:22:41.550" style="s2">to do is check back in but without the</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.960" end="01:22:43.950" style="s2">commitment to you going concern so</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.550" end="01:22:46.850" style="s2">unique so theory would undermine all of</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.950" end="01:22:49.170" style="s2">those forms of teaching that focus on</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.850" end="01:22:51.510" style="s2">spirituality and religiosity as being</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.170" end="01:22:54.360" style="s2">about the homogenous asian of identity</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.510" end="01:22:57.330" style="s2">and experience towards a single ideal of</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.360" end="01:22:59.489" style="s2">the better human or the enlightened</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.330" end="01:23:01.680" style="s2">human or the wise one right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.489" end="01:23:03.720" style="s2">according to unique self theory you</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.680" end="01:23:06.770" style="s2">could never have something like a guru</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.720" end="01:23:09.480" style="s2">and the traditional Hindu sense because</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.770" end="01:23:11.160" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re worshiping a guru</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.480" end="01:23:13.440" style="s2">in the traditional Hindu sense you are</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.160" end="01:23:16.200" style="s2">trying to become identical with what the</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.440" end="01:23:18.000" style="s2">Guru is identical to already right which</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.200" end="01:23:20.070" style="s2">is to say you&#39;re trying to find the true</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.000" end="01:23:22.530" style="s2">self though only one there&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.070" end="01:23:25.800" style="s2">true self you&#39;re trying to find that</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.530" end="01:23:27.120" style="s2">through the vehicle of the Guru mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.800" end="01:23:30.239" style="s2">but that may be have worked in like a</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.120" end="01:23:32.940" style="s2">pre-modern society but in a meta pattern</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.239" end="01:23:36.780" style="s2">society there&#39;s a need to actually have</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.940" end="01:23:39.060" style="s2">this realization of the potency of each</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.780" end="01:23:42.810" style="s2">unique individual this is kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.060" end="01:23:44.760" style="s2">burden of our time in a way and so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.810" end="01:23:47.280" style="s2">actualizing uniqueness requires</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.760" end="01:23:48.630" style="s2">dissident a&#39;f eyeing from the simple</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.280" end="01:23:50.010" style="s2">frontal personality which is actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.630" end="01:23:52.320" style="s2">not unique that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.010" end="01:23:54.360" style="s2">captured by advertising it&#39;s been now</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.320" end="01:23:56.370" style="s2">modernized by the schools that&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.360" end="01:24:01.440" style="s2">modernized by traditional religious</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.370" end="01:24:03.960" style="s2">teachings so there&#39;s a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.440" end="01:24:08.730" style="s2">radical core to the unique self teaching</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.960" end="01:24:11.640" style="s2">that brings certain forms of spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.730" end="01:24:14.730" style="s2">and religious practice out of the realm</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.640" end="01:24:17.400" style="s2">of escapism and into the realm of</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.730" end="01:24:21.690" style="s2">something like a seer chick activism</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.400" end="01:24:25.590" style="s2">right seer chick being a term that means</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.690" end="01:24:29.850" style="s2">basically like the actions of God mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.590" end="01:24:31.949" style="s2">that my hands are fans of God uniquely</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.850" end="01:24:34.590" style="s2">positioned here as</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.949" end="01:24:36.959" style="s2">to the experience of God being one in</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.590" end="01:24:39.749" style="s2">which now I don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.959" end="01:24:41.309" style="s2">with my hands cuz I&#39;m saved it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.749" end="01:24:43.889" style="s2">opposite it&#39;s the experience of being</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.309" end="01:24:46.229" style="s2">whoa I have these hands these are the</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.889" end="01:24:50.940" style="s2">only ones that can do this unique thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.229" end="01:24:52.619" style="s2">that&#39;s mine to do yeah good stuff I you</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.940" end="01:24:54.239" style="s2">know I liked it and then I put it on my</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.619" end="01:24:56.610" style="s2">list after I read some Wilber I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.239" end="01:24:58.260" style="s2">go read mark Gaffney and what was really</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.610" end="01:25:00.479" style="s2">interesting is I was reading an end even</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.260" end="01:25:03.389" style="s2">more so as you were saying it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.479" end="01:25:06.179" style="s2">not far at all from my view on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.389" end="01:25:08.699" style="s2">going on with religion and why at the</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.179" end="01:25:10.739" style="s2">end of the day most religions with their</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.699" end="01:25:13.019" style="s2">most advanced practitioners are saying</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.739" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">pretty much the same thing mine is a</p>

<p begin="01:25:14.400" end="01:25:20.550" style="s2">argument which goes as follows is that</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.709" end="01:25:23.849" style="s2">the brain is a series of networks and</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.550" end="01:25:26.579" style="s2">cycles and rhythms but it falls into</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.849" end="01:25:28.800" style="s2">some stereotypical attractor networks</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.579" end="01:25:30.840" style="s2">basic configurations that vary in real</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.800" end="01:25:32.550" style="s2">time which is how our consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.840" end="01:25:34.499" style="s2">modulated and how our unconscious is</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.550" end="01:25:38.159" style="s2">modulated behind the scenes but they</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.499" end="01:25:40.860" style="s2">fall into some broad classes so the two</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.159" end="01:25:43.409" style="s2">most well-known are the so called task</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.860" end="01:25:46.079" style="s2">mode Network for instance if you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.409" end="01:25:47.639" style="s2">doing a very a detailed task is the pure</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.079" end="01:25:49.380" style="s2">example the task mode network</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.639" end="01:25:51.539" style="s2">particularly the first time you do it</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.380" end="01:25:53.969" style="s2">take for example when you were eight</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.539" end="01:25:55.949" style="s2">years old and you changed the tire on</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.969" end="01:25:58.530" style="s2">your bicycle when you got a flat tire</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.949" end="01:26:01.260" style="s2">fix the flat disassembled the gears took</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.530" end="01:26:03.360" style="s2">the rear wheel off pulled the tire off</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.260" end="01:26:04.709" style="s2">the rim past that you probably had your</p>

<p begin="01:26:04.709" end="01:26:06.449" style="s2">older brother and put it back together</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.909" end="01:26:09.809" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.449" end="01:26:12.329" style="s2">that&#39;s classic task mode network the</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.809" end="01:26:14.639" style="s2">other very well-known big network is</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.329" end="01:26:16.650" style="s2">called the default mode network and</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.639" end="01:26:19.110" style="s2">that&#39;s where you&#39;re daydreaming this</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.650" end="01:26:21.150" style="s2">sort of spacing out will also say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.110" end="01:26:24.170" style="s2">the network that you fall into in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.150" end="01:26:27.239" style="s2">earlier or later stages of meditation</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.170" end="01:26:29.729" style="s2">but there&#39;s another network which I call</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.239" end="01:26:30.780" style="s2">the mystical experience network you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.729" end="01:26:32.550" style="s2">we talked about having mystical</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.780" end="01:26:32.849" style="s2">experiences I&#39;ve had plenty of them all</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.550" end="01:26:34.889" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.849" end="01:26:36.479" style="s2">I&#39;ve done my share acid and other</p>

<p begin="01:26:43.619" end="01:26:49.080" style="s2">enjoy it which is I can produce a</p>

<p begin="01:27:36.750" end="01:27:40.680" style="s2">of the day all the religions look alike</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.430" end="01:27:42.540" style="s2">because they&#39;re essentially roads to</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.680" end="01:27:45.030" style="s2">make it easier for at least the adepts</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.540" end="01:27:47.850" style="s2">to put themselves in the configuration</p>

<p begin="01:27:47.850" end="01:27:53.880" style="s2">neural basin of Attraction hmm totally I</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.480" end="01:27:57.300" style="s2">love that theory you know and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.880" end="01:27:59.160" style="s2">like you&#39;re not an atheist because like</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.300" end="01:28:01.920" style="s2">what because what&#39;s the value of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.160" end="01:28:03.690" style="s2">mystical Network like what&#39;s the value</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.920" end="01:28:05.160" style="s2">of what&#39;s revealed within your mystical</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.690" end="01:28:07.590" style="s2">Network right because that&#39;s the real</p>

<p begin="01:28:07.590" end="01:28:13.230" style="s2">really Authority based upon access to</p>

<p begin="01:28:13.230" end="01:28:17.220" style="s2">said that the mystical network reveals</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.880" end="01:28:19.110" style="s2">something at least as real as what the</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.220" end="01:28:21.000" style="s2">other networks reveal you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.110" end="01:28:22.710" style="s2">pretend that what&#39;s revealed in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.000" end="01:28:24.840" style="s2">mystical network can then be actualized</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.710" end="01:28:28.560" style="s2">or understood in terms set by the other</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.840" end="01:28:31.610" style="s2">networks right so it&#39;s like you see in</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.560" end="01:28:35.370" style="s2">the mystical network something like this</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.610" end="01:28:37.590" style="s2">incredibly precise geometrical temple of</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.370" end="01:28:40.170" style="s2">light right now does that mean you need</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.590" end="01:28:43.110" style="s2">to actually build that thing in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.170" end="01:28:44.640" style="s2">desert to secure your immortality right</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.110" end="01:28:46.500" style="s2">this is what the unions would call</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.640" end="01:28:50.160" style="s2">literalization and the answer is no</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.500" end="01:28:52.239" style="s2">right there&#39;s a way to relate to the</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.160" end="01:28:54.999" style="s2">knowledge revealed in the mystical net</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.239" end="01:28:57.699" style="s2">work but you can&#39;t make that knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.999" end="01:28:59.139" style="s2">kind of strictly isomorphic with the</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.699" end="01:29:01.960" style="s2">forms of knowledge that it reveals from</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.139" end="01:29:03.639" style="s2">the other networks and so this becomes</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.960" end="01:29:05.860" style="s2">about and this is why it&#39;s good you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:29:05.860" end="01:29:09.369" style="s2">this at length you know what are the</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.749" end="01:29:11.230" style="s2">different varieties of religious</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.369" end="01:29:12.730" style="s2">experience right to use William James</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.230" end="01:29:15.130" style="s2">who would also agree with you or is it</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.730" end="01:29:17.219" style="s2">useful right he ultimately says well God</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.130" end="01:29:20.949" style="s2">is the most useful concept we have</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.219" end="01:29:23.530" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s true but he also did the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.949" end="01:29:25.030" style="s2">first really good I think rich social</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.530" end="01:29:26.650" style="s2">science research on religion which is</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.030" end="01:29:28.630" style="s2">that remains one of the most famous</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.650" end="01:29:29.889" style="s2">books taught and religious we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.630" end="01:29:32.949" style="s2">religion departments which is the</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.889" end="01:29:35.380" style="s2">varieties for those experience you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.949" end="01:29:38.769" style="s2">I think principles of psychology was</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.380" end="01:29:40.300" style="s2">published in 1819 so I think varieties</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.769" end="01:29:42.159" style="s2">of religious experience was right around</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.300" end="01:29:44.079" style="s2">the turn of the century and he just</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.159" end="01:29:46.090" style="s2">simply interviewed people who had</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.079" end="01:29:48.280" style="s2">consistent access to your mystical</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.090" end="01:29:50.380" style="s2">Network and just got them to tell their</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.280" end="01:29:53.050" style="s2">stories of their experience and what</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.380" end="01:29:55.420" style="s2">that experience did how it shaped the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.050" end="01:29:57.099" style="s2">rest of their lives and the basic</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.420" end="01:29:58.389" style="s2">finding was that and Maslow found the</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.099" end="01:29:59.800" style="s2">same thing with the people who had</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.389" end="01:30:02.590" style="s2">consistent access to the self</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.800" end="01:30:04.300" style="s2">transcendent form of identity which was</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.590" end="01:30:05.739" style="s2">that those people who can consistently</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.300" end="01:30:07.239" style="s2">have these kinds of experience where</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.739" end="01:30:10.150" style="s2">they kind of plug into the mystical</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.239" end="01:30:14.050" style="s2">matrix they consistently had lives that</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.150" end="01:30:16.389" style="s2">were uniquely dedicated to to good ends</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.050" end="01:30:19.090" style="s2">and this was James&#39;s final kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.389" end="01:30:21.280" style="s2">verdict was that you know some forms of</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.090" end="01:30:23.170" style="s2">religion end up being tyrannical but the</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.280" end="01:30:25.539" style="s2">forms of religion that are based upon</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.170" end="01:30:28.690" style="s2">giving people direct access to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.539" end="01:30:31.059" style="s2">mystical system those ones actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.690" end="01:30:32.920" style="s2">provide people with lives that are more</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.059" end="01:30:36.070" style="s2">meaningful it&#39;s kind of socially</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.920" end="01:30:38.110" style="s2">beneficial compassionate full of joy and</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.070" end="01:30:40.210" style="s2">things of that nature it&#39;s be reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.110" end="01:30:41.409" style="s2">to make yeah so that was it was good to</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.210" end="01:30:43.480" style="s2">kind of bring it back to that cuz now</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.409" end="01:30:46.090" style="s2">here I think we&#39;re finding some some</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.480" end="01:30:47.559" style="s2">agreement yeah yeah I wouldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.090" end="01:30:50.139" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call it religion I would just</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.559" end="01:30:51.999" style="s2">call it cognitive neuroscience but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.139" end="01:30:55.300" style="s2">the two meet somewhere deep enough and</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.999" end="01:30:57.699" style="s2">must it&#39;s possible well I&#39;m open-minded</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.300" end="01:30:59.800" style="s2">I am an empiricist all right when I find</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.699" end="01:31:01.539" style="s2">the evidence and I&#39;m looking forward to</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.800" end="01:31:03.460" style="s2">learning more about I&#39;ve read about 40%</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.539" end="01:31:05.650" style="s2">of ken Wilbur&#39;s book and I love about is</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.460" end="01:31:07.390" style="s2">how amazingly clear it is I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.650" end="01:31:08.530" style="s2">you know so many books on these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.390" end="01:31:11.530" style="s2">topics are full of what I call</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.530" end="01:31:13.780" style="s2">hocus-pocus right but Wilbur is clearly</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.530" end="01:31:16.330" style="s2">attempting to be as clear as</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.780" end="01:31:17.620" style="s2">possible which is actually great so you</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.330" end="01:31:19.510" style="s2">can actually assess what he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.620" end="01:31:21.910" style="s2">say without having to decode it but</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.510" end="01:31:23.620" style="s2">let&#39;s move on finally to the last topic</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.910" end="01:31:25.930" style="s2">which we&#39;ve been trying to get to for</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.620" end="01:31:27.340" style="s2">the last three episodes and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.930" end="01:31:29.590" style="s2">important to spend at least 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.340" end="01:31:31.570" style="s2">on we have that too much time which is</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.590" end="01:31:34.090" style="s2">that you&#39;ve acknowledged in the book and</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.570" end="01:31:36.700" style="s2">also through these three episodes that</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.090" end="01:31:39.160" style="s2">to some degree the kind of education</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.700" end="01:31:41.710" style="s2">that you see as necessary for what comes</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.160" end="01:31:44.560" style="s2">next for Humanity for this next big big</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.710" end="01:31:47.070" style="s2">step at least as big as the transition</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.560" end="01:31:50.350" style="s2">from feudalism to modernism is</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.070" end="01:31:52.540" style="s2">essentially impossible to actually bring</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.350" end="01:31:54.610" style="s2">into existence in our current world for</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.540" end="01:31:57.040" style="s2">a whole bunch of reasons or at least</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.610" end="01:31:58.480" style="s2">would be hard to bring my own version of</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.040" end="01:32:00.490" style="s2">that it would be hard to bring it in on</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.480" end="01:32:02.110" style="s2">a mass scale in the current world I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.490" end="01:32:04.570" style="s2">hopeful that it can be brought into</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.110" end="01:32:06.820" style="s2">existence among some self-selecting</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.570" end="01:32:09.190" style="s2">people who essentially build their own</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.820" end="01:32:10.960" style="s2">bubble social operating system inside</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.190" end="01:32:13.180" style="s2">the other operating system I think we</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.960" end="01:32:15.010" style="s2">call game B and that within people</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.180" end="01:32:16.930" style="s2">living a true game B life even though</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.010" end="01:32:18.940" style="s2">they&#39;re still embedded in game a they</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.930" end="01:32:21.100" style="s2">ought to be able to build a context in</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.940" end="01:32:23.320" style="s2">which ideas like your educational ideas</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.100" end="01:32:25.450" style="s2">are possible but probably not possible</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.320" end="01:32:28.290" style="s2">for the masses and you acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.450" end="01:32:31.990" style="s2">and what you say is what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.290" end="01:32:34.180" style="s2">r-13 social miracles which remarkably</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.990" end="01:32:35.890" style="s2">close to some of the things that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.180" end="01:32:38.170" style="s2">talked about in our game B world and</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.890" end="01:32:41.350" style="s2">other people talked about in other areas</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.170" end="01:32:44.080" style="s2">of what I&#39;d call the good attractor what</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.350" end="01:32:46.290" style="s2">comes next in terms of the evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.080" end="01:32:49.510" style="s2">the social operating system for Humanity</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.290" end="01:32:52.120" style="s2">so if we could spend just a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.510" end="01:32:53.710" style="s2">minutes on each one of your thirteen</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.120" end="01:32:56.890" style="s2">social miracles is that does that work</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.710" end="01:32:58.510" style="s2">for you that works great sure yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.890" end="01:32:59.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know about Zack doing a couple</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.510" end="01:33:03.250" style="s2">minutes on anything that boy likes to</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.980" end="01:33:07.930" style="s2">talk I think the best thing to do is</p>

<p begin="01:35:01.409" end="01:35:09.230" style="s2">right yeah this is uh this is what has</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.409" end="01:35:13.340" style="s2">been called by people like Roy Bhaskar</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.230" end="01:35:17.400" style="s2">you know concrete utopian theorizing and</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.340" end="01:35:19.349" style="s2">these came to me actually you know it</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.400" end="01:35:21.929" style="s2">took a while for all of them to finally</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.349" end="01:35:23.429" style="s2">congeal into the thirteen but the way</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.929" end="01:35:25.230" style="s2">they&#39;re the way they&#39;re put in the book</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.429" end="01:35:29.369" style="s2">is like you know what are the conditions</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.230" end="01:35:30.660" style="s2">for the possibility of a actually humane</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.369" end="01:35:31.860" style="s2">educational system</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.660" end="01:35:34.500" style="s2">right because everyone asked me usually</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.860" end="01:35:36.120" style="s2">like you know what school chefs have</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.500" end="01:35:37.830" style="s2">Mike into what&#39;s the best what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.120" end="01:35:40.800" style="s2">best school you know and the answer ends</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.830" end="01:35:42.960" style="s2">up being well the school&#39;s not the main</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.800" end="01:35:45.270" style="s2">effect first of all the whole social</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.960" end="01:35:47.010" style="s2">system surrounding the school ends up</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.270" end="01:35:49.680" style="s2">determining what takes place in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.010" end="01:35:51.740" style="s2">school if what the kid got from the</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.680" end="01:35:53.640" style="s2">school is gonna be useful afterwards and</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.740" end="01:35:56.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of things that</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.640" end="01:35:58.470" style="s2">make the school actually not the focus</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.640" end="01:36:00.890" style="s2">of attention when thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.470" end="01:36:03.830" style="s2">educational potentials within a society</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.890" end="01:36:06.710" style="s2">so this is about actually thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.830" end="01:36:09.260" style="s2">all of society again sub specie</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.710" end="01:36:11.640" style="s2">education us which means thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.260" end="01:36:14.130" style="s2">all of the reforms you could make</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.640" end="01:36:15.870" style="s2">including reforms to the finance</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.130" end="01:36:18.540" style="s2">industries and reforms to health care</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.870" end="01:36:20.100" style="s2">and reforms to geography and other</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.540" end="01:36:22.320" style="s2">things all of those reforms actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.100" end="01:36:24.560" style="s2">have an impact on the process of</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.320" end="01:36:28.410" style="s2">intergenerational transmission that</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.560" end="01:36:32.360" style="s2">everything we&#39;re doing has education at</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.410" end="01:36:36.180" style="s2">stake and if we if we want to basically</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.360" end="01:36:38.520" style="s2">respect the possibility of the human as</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.180" end="01:36:40.980" style="s2">revealed let&#39;s say by the most</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.520" end="01:36:42.720" style="s2">sophisticated communities of practice in</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.980" end="01:36:46.410" style="s2">discourse and religion right like the</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.720" end="01:36:49.590" style="s2">true potential of the human if we want</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.410" end="01:36:51.930" style="s2">to find a way to get that through like</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.590" end="01:36:53.670" style="s2">to get that reliably in an educational</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.930" end="01:36:56.430" style="s2">configuration then we&#39;re gonna actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.670" end="01:36:58.320" style="s2">have to reconfigure society itself and</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.430" end="01:37:00.120" style="s2">so what I was trying to do with 13</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.320" end="01:37:03.150" style="s2">social miracles was just actually the</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.120" end="01:37:04.500" style="s2">list off those things that are need to</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.150" end="01:37:06.750" style="s2">be part of what we&#39;re concerned about if</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.500" end="01:37:09.530" style="s2">we&#39;re really concerned about educating</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.750" end="01:37:13.860" style="s2">the next generation and these are also</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.530" end="01:37:17.250" style="s2">kind of structures and systems that are</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.860" end="01:37:19.380" style="s2">sometimes seem to be far from education</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.250" end="01:37:21.450" style="s2">but that actually get right up in</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.380" end="01:37:23.640" style="s2">intimate with educational experience and</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.450" end="01:37:26.360" style="s2">the the basic income is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.640" end="01:37:31.020" style="s2">greatest examples of that where you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.360" end="01:37:34.470" style="s2">so long as schools are preparing you for</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.020" end="01:37:39.270" style="s2">the wage labor market then schooling can</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.470" end="01:37:41.370" style="s2">only be so much right that right now we</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.270" end="01:37:42.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a basic confusion and has been</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.370" end="01:37:46.220" style="s2">for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.810" end="01:37:48.960" style="s2">of schooling as job training that the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.220" end="01:37:50.730" style="s2">goal of the school is to basically get</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.960" end="01:37:53.210" style="s2">you into position to be entering the</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.730" end="01:37:55.020" style="s2">wage labor market at a certain level now</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.210" end="01:37:56.820" style="s2">what that means is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.020" end="01:37:59.220" style="s2">drastically limiting those things that</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.820" end="01:38:01.140" style="s2">people pursue within schools because the</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.220" end="01:38:03.240" style="s2">overarching concern of schooling is the</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.140" end="01:38:05.130" style="s2">eventual entry into the labor market but</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.240" end="01:38:06.570" style="s2">imagine labor markets shifted</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.130" end="01:38:09.180" style="s2">drastically like because there was a</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.570" end="01:38:11.760" style="s2">bunch of automation right or because</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.180" end="01:38:14.220" style="s2">there was a pandemic that destroyed all</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.760" end="01:38:15.750" style="s2">of the service industries at once and</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.220" end="01:38:17.940" style="s2">only a small percentage of them could</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.750" end="01:38:21.240" style="s2">reboot so you end up looking at a much</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.940" end="01:38:24.540" style="s2">smaller labor market and a much larger</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.240" end="01:38:27.530" style="s2">group of people who could understand</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.540" end="01:38:30.690" style="s2">themselves outside of the context of</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.530" end="01:38:32.490" style="s2">wage labor and this is um this is you</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.690" end="01:38:35.010" style="s2">know it&#39;s not historically unprecedented</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.490" end="01:38:37.230" style="s2">because before the capitalist world</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.010" end="01:38:38.760" style="s2">system emerged at the end of the long</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.230" end="01:38:41.040" style="s2">sixteenth century</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.760" end="01:38:42.930" style="s2">the category of wage labor didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.040" end="01:38:45.780" style="s2">exist nearly as much if at all and if</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.930" end="01:38:47.130" style="s2">you look back into other you know more</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.780" end="01:38:49.380" style="s2">ancient civilizations you know this</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.130" end="01:38:51.540" style="s2">notion of the wage laborer is a specific</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.380" end="01:38:54.060" style="s2">thing and it&#39;s going to become less</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.540" end="01:38:56.580" style="s2">dominant it already is people are</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.060" end="01:38:59.820" style="s2">predicting it so now imagine in a school</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.580" end="01:39:01.710" style="s2">system that runs where the main</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.820" end="01:39:03.210" style="s2">overarching concern of the school system</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.710" end="01:39:07.190" style="s2">is actually not preparing you to get a</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.210" end="01:39:10.320" style="s2">job but preparing you to make good on</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.190" end="01:39:13.680" style="s2">something like your basic income right</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.320" end="01:39:15.990" style="s2">and but yeah that only works if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.680" end="01:39:18.510" style="s2">at the simultaneously if you&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.990" end="01:39:20.910" style="s2">performed the finance sector right</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.510" end="01:39:22.260" style="s2">because the basic income guarantee could</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.910" end="01:39:24.060" style="s2">actually make it so that these people</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.260" end="01:39:26.430" style="s2">are then preyed upon by the finance</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.060" end="01:39:28.530" style="s2">sector or the whole thing couldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.430" end="01:39:30.960" style="s2">because of the needs of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.530" end="01:39:33.240" style="s2">in the national bonds of international</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.960" end="01:39:35.160" style="s2">banking so you have to reform the whole</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.240" end="01:39:36.690" style="s2">entire monetary system actually do the</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.160" end="01:39:38.760" style="s2">basic income guarantee and the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.690" end="01:39:40.620" style="s2">banking needs to change an age of</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.760" end="01:39:42.600" style="s2">currency needs to change or else that</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.620" end="01:39:45.510" style="s2">won&#39;t work but then you also have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.600" end="01:39:47.520" style="s2">make the energy renewable because if you</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.510" end="01:39:50.550" style="s2">release a whole bunch of and</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.520" end="01:39:53.520" style="s2">in terms of money into people and</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.550" end="01:39:55.890" style="s2">empower a bunch of economic agents with</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.520" end="01:39:58.290" style="s2">better schooling and the basic income</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.890" end="01:40:01.860" style="s2">then you could just drive consumerism</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.290" end="01:40:04.140" style="s2">and you know like a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.860" end="01:40:06.150" style="s2">dynamics that would tax the energy grid</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.140" end="01:40:08.250" style="s2">to the point of escalating are already</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.150" end="01:40:10.590" style="s2">self terminating mode with energy so you</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.250" end="01:40:11.400" style="s2">need different energy and that&#39;s of</p>

<p begin="01:40:11.400" end="01:40:16.190" style="s2">question right so you so the whole point</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.710" end="01:40:19.500" style="s2">is that there&#39;s this constellation of</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.190" end="01:40:21.960" style="s2">interrelated huge systemic things that</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.500" end="01:40:24.830" style="s2">at the end of the day boil right down to</p>

<p begin="01:40:28.950" end="01:40:34.170" style="s2">do each one of these it&#39;s not that and</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.380" end="01:40:37.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not even saying like this 13 is the</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.170" end="01:40:40.140" style="s2">set that is necessary and sufficient for</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.130" end="01:40:42.750" style="s2">civilization to work for the next 15</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.140" end="01:40:45.000" style="s2">thousand years like not that it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:40:45.000" end="01:40:48.990" style="s2">you really want to think about education</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.680" end="01:40:52.770" style="s2">this is the level at which you need to</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.990" end="01:40:55.950" style="s2">exercise your imagination you know that</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.770" end="01:40:59.970" style="s2">the first place we had uniforms and</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.950" end="01:41:02.340" style="s2">standardized tests was the military that</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.970" end="01:41:04.650" style="s2">the military industrial complex was the</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.340" end="01:41:07.620" style="s2">main impetus behind some of the largest</p>

<p begin="01:41:12.750" end="01:41:16.320" style="s2">engineering and math a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.610" end="01:41:17.640" style="s2">those things the growth of places like</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.320" end="01:41:19.680" style="s2">UC Berkeley and elsewhere that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:41:21.270" end="01:41:28.260" style="s2">right so if we don&#39;t demilitarized then</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.880" end="01:41:29.880" style="s2">even the best you bi not UB is the</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.260" end="01:41:32.190" style="s2">that&#39;s the wrong phrase but basic and</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.880" end="01:41:33.630" style="s2">gum healthcare all that&#39;s there but now</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.190" end="01:41:36.240" style="s2">the things churning for the interests of</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.630" end="01:41:39.510" style="s2">military mmm oops that&#39;s another self</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.240" end="01:41:41.430" style="s2">terminating bad educational situation so</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.510" end="01:41:42.810" style="s2">you end up having to deal with even at</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.430" end="01:41:43.980" style="s2">that level of the military and once</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.810" end="01:41:45.870" style="s2">you&#39;ve done that then you have to start</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.980" end="01:41:49.620" style="s2">thinking about the organization of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.870" end="01:41:51.930" style="s2">land itself the basic identity of place</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.620" end="01:41:53.580" style="s2">and the emergence of something like a</p>

<p begin="01:41:53.580" end="01:41:56.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.810" end="01:41:58.950" style="s2">journalism so I&#39;m weaving together all</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.880" end="01:42:00.960" style="s2">the 13 social miracles in Canada a</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.950" end="01:42:02.880" style="s2">single conversation and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.960" end="01:42:04.590" style="s2">first ones the debt Jubilee and this</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.880" end="01:42:06.510" style="s2">one&#39;s actually on people&#39;s minds now</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.590" end="01:42:09.030" style="s2">which is what&#39;s interesting because and</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.510" end="01:42:12.300" style="s2">this is true for a lot of the things in</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.030" end="01:42:14.520" style="s2">the book itself which is that when I was</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.300" end="01:42:18.210" style="s2">writing at these things were kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.520" end="01:42:19.650" style="s2">edgy and kind of like whoa okay and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.210" end="01:42:21.090" style="s2">the pandemic hit and then a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.650" end="01:42:23.250" style="s2">of the stuff that&#39;s in the book actually</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.090" end="01:42:26.430" style="s2">became more relevant more timely as a</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.250" end="01:42:31.200" style="s2">result of the drastic speed-up of a</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.430" end="01:42:34.170" style="s2">bunch of trends and so the debt Jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.200" end="01:42:35.730" style="s2">seems to me to be almost a necessity at</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.170" end="01:42:39.570" style="s2">this point in terms of the economic</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.730" end="01:42:41.940" style="s2">situation that the debt and specifically</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.570" end="01:42:43.530" style="s2">the debt of individuals there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.940" end="01:42:45.300" style="s2">other conversation about debt Jubilees</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.530" end="01:42:47.310" style="s2">for institutions and countries but if</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.300" end="01:42:49.530" style="s2">you just look at student loan debt alone</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.310" end="01:42:51.030" style="s2">student loan debt is part of that</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.530" end="01:42:52.740" style="s2">intergenerational warfare we were</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.030" end="01:42:53.940" style="s2">talking about because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.740" end="01:42:57.450" style="s2">crippling generation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.940" end="01:43:00.360" style="s2">demonstrably predatory so this is an</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.450" end="01:43:04.110" style="s2">example where if you were to have a non</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.360" end="01:43:05.910" style="s2">debt based system of higher education it</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.110" end="01:43:07.950" style="s2">would change the possibilities for what</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.910" end="01:43:10.200" style="s2">happens in colleges and universities and</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.950" end="01:43:11.820" style="s2">I think we already discussed the</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.200" end="01:43:14.070" style="s2">education commodity proposition that</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.820" end="01:43:15.420" style="s2">have that undermines the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.070" end="01:43:16.980" style="s2">teacher the authority but this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.420" end="01:43:19.470" style="s2">taking place on college campuses because</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.980" end="01:43:21.870" style="s2">these kids are taking out mortgages to</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.470" end="01:43:24.180" style="s2">sit in the classroom for four years and</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.870" end="01:43:26.850" style="s2">so they are consumers rather than</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.180" end="01:43:29.670" style="s2">learners so there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.850" end="01:43:33.510" style="s2">things within the social miracles that</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.670" end="01:43:35.040" style="s2">are in isolation a bad idea like a basic</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.510" end="01:43:37.080" style="s2">income is a bad idea if you do it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.040" end="01:43:38.250" style="s2">it if you just cut people a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.080" end="01:43:39.720" style="s2">checks and don&#39;t change anything else</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.250" end="01:43:42.810" style="s2">about society like that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.720" end="01:43:44.760" style="s2">terrible idea right and you can say that</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.810" end="01:43:47.250" style="s2">about many of these things you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.760" end="01:43:48.420" style="s2">for example demilitarize in one part of</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.250" end="01:43:50.730" style="s2">the world if you don&#39;t demilitarize</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.420" end="01:43:51.900" style="s2">everywhere like if America was like oh</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.730" end="01:43:54.720" style="s2">we&#39;re all putting our guns down then</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.900" end="01:43:57.120" style="s2">we&#39;d be invaded and destroyed right so</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.720" end="01:43:59.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.120" end="01:44:01.330" style="s2">careful kind of sequencing of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.910" end="01:44:03.310" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.330" end="01:44:07.180" style="s2">changing systems at this scope and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.310" end="01:44:08.920" style="s2">not even something that can be thought</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.180" end="01:44:10.810" style="s2">it was like a political platform or any</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.920" end="01:44:13.690" style="s2">kind of logistical thing I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.810" end="01:44:15.760" style="s2">here again thought experiments and then</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.690" end="01:44:18.850" style="s2">you know one they hadn&#39;t mentioned but</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.760" end="01:44:21.090" style="s2">which is worth mentioning the unity of</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.850" end="01:44:25.930" style="s2">religion we&#39;ve already discussed how</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.090" end="01:44:29.920" style="s2">essential that actually is as a fulcrum</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.930" end="01:44:31.750" style="s2">in the planetary culture that even if we</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.920" end="01:44:33.100" style="s2">solve these other problems with getting</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.750" end="01:44:34.260" style="s2">the currency right and getting the</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.100" end="01:44:37.000" style="s2">income right and now we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.260" end="01:44:38.560" style="s2">universal healthcare that actually works</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.000" end="01:44:39.510" style="s2">and isn&#39;t centralized and over</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.560" end="01:44:44.530" style="s2">bureaucratized</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.510" end="01:44:46.450" style="s2">captured by profit-seeking science if we</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.530" end="01:44:50.250" style="s2">have all that but the religion still</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.450" end="01:44:54.130" style="s2">don&#39;t get along and we&#39;ve still got like</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.250" end="01:44:56.200" style="s2">backward fundamentalists reactionary</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.130" end="01:44:58.980" style="s2">religious violence that we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.200" end="01:45:02.290" style="s2">failed and so we need to foster</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.980" end="01:45:05.380" style="s2">coherence in the depths of human culture</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.290" end="01:45:07.210" style="s2">as well as bring efficiency and</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.380" end="01:45:11.050" style="s2">reasonableness to the infrastructures</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.210" end="01:45:13.720" style="s2">and economic systems you know and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.050" end="01:45:16.960" style="s2">final one the thirteenth one which is</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.720" end="01:45:19.840" style="s2">about science in the interest of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.960" end="01:45:21.820" style="s2">human flourishing and exploration you</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.840" end="01:45:23.410" style="s2">know this is the only place in the book</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.820" end="01:45:26.320" style="s2">that I think that I talked about outer</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.410" end="01:45:29.050" style="s2">space but in fact for a lot of the book</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.320" end="01:45:31.180" style="s2">in part because I had so much science</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.050" end="01:45:33.430" style="s2">fiction as a kid you know a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.180" end="01:45:35.560" style="s2">book I&#39;m thinking about like what would</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.430" end="01:45:39.940" style="s2">be an educational system that could</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.560" end="01:45:41.470" style="s2">actually get humans to be a species that</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.940" end="01:45:45.040" style="s2">was involved with more than just the</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.470" end="01:45:46.690" style="s2">earth right like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.040" end="01:45:49.270" style="s2">possibility that we flee the earth</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.690" end="01:45:52.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s dying right like Elon Musk</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.270" end="01:45:54.700" style="s2">we like bug out to Mars and it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.200" end="01:45:57.990" style="s2">that&#39;s the only motive we could have is</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.700" end="01:46:01.300" style="s2">just survival but I&#39;m imagining a</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.990" end="01:46:04.660" style="s2">civilizational kind of architecture in</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.300" end="01:46:08.590" style="s2">which no it&#39;s actually from the excess</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.660" end="01:46:12.550" style="s2">of our curiosity and accomplishment that</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.590" end="01:46:14.140" style="s2">we quote/unquote take to the stars right</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.550" end="01:46:16.080" style="s2">because if we take to the stars out of</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.140" end="01:46:19.060" style="s2">fear if we take to the stars out of</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.080" end="01:46:21.940" style="s2">profit seeking and enslavement and how</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.060" end="01:46:25.330" style="s2">like Jesus you know that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.940" end="01:46:26.980" style="s2">last so yes some of what the thirteen</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.330" end="01:46:31.810" style="s2">social miracles are getting at should</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.980" end="01:46:33.970" style="s2">feel like some science fiction concrete</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.810" end="01:46:37.120" style="s2">utopia because that&#39;s in fact what it is</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.970" end="01:46:37.840" style="s2">it&#39;s saying where&#39;s the future I was</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.120" end="01:46:40.210" style="s2">promised</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.840" end="01:46:42.010" style="s2">I remember Jordan Hall told me once when</p>

<p begin="01:47:23.620" end="01:47:28.060" style="s2">to hold them because when you when you</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.480" end="01:47:29.830" style="s2">look at one like basic income we could</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.060" end="01:47:31.510" style="s2">do a whole podcast just on that you</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.830" end="01:47:34.090" style="s2">could do a whole podcast series on that</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.510" end="01:47:36.190" style="s2">like and I say in the book you know each</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.090" end="01:47:38.650" style="s2">of the social miracles I could take a</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.190" end="01:47:40.570" style="s2">book to write about it you know the debt</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.650" end="01:47:41.980" style="s2">Jubilee so much involved there the</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.570" end="01:47:43.930" style="s2">ancient history of the Jubilee is</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.980" end="01:47:46.510" style="s2">fascinating David Graeber gets into that</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.930" end="01:47:49.150" style="s2">and his wonderful book on debt and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.510" end="01:47:51.280" style="s2">the actual financial apparatuses and</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.150" end="01:47:53.620" style="s2">mechanisms that could allow for this</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.280" end="01:47:54.820" style="s2">kind of massive financial rearrangement</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.620" end="01:47:57.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s so much to discuss there</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.820" end="01:47:59.530" style="s2">same with the unity of religions and the</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.670" end="01:48:02.020" style="s2">new forms of urbanization and</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.530" end="01:48:03.880" style="s2">regionalism and agriculture so by no</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.020" end="01:48:06.640" style="s2">means am i covering that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.880" end="01:48:08.590" style="s2">comprehensively what I&#39;m trying to do in</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.640" end="01:48:10.930" style="s2">a way similar to what Ken Wilber does is</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.590" end="01:48:13.840" style="s2">just put a bunch of things next to one</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.930" end="01:48:17.070" style="s2">another in very clear language so that</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.840" end="01:48:19.350" style="s2">something like an AHA occurs</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.070" end="01:48:22.650" style="s2">we&#39;re the social imagination is now</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.350" end="01:48:24.690" style="s2">sparked in a new way so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.650" end="01:48:28.680" style="s2">ultimate goal of the social miracles now</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.690" end="01:48:30.990" style="s2">if some of them are near-term realizable</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.680" end="01:48:33.480" style="s2">is actual political or technological</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.990" end="01:48:35.730" style="s2">goals that&#39;s another story and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.480" end="01:48:37.350" style="s2">getting into that but I do think some of</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.730" end="01:48:39.420" style="s2">them are and I do think there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.350" end="01:48:41.640" style="s2">a sequence to them and it&#39;s looking like</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.420" end="01:48:43.620" style="s2">the debt Jubilee and the basic income</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.640" end="01:48:46.470" style="s2">thing is going to happen sooner rather</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.620" end="01:48:48.240" style="s2">than later and for better or for worse</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.470" end="01:48:50.460" style="s2">because remember you roll a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.240" end="01:48:51.450" style="s2">these out apps and the other ones you</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.460" end="01:48:53.730" style="s2">can actually end up with a worse</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.450" end="01:48:56.010" style="s2">situation so yeah so that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.730" end="01:48:57.510" style="s2">of a gestalt of the whole thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.010" end="01:48:59.970" style="s2">great that&#39;s great that did a good job</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.510" end="01:49:01.200" style="s2">they&#39;re painting it let me just react a</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.970" end="01:49:03.150" style="s2">little bit I think you know again</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.200" end="01:49:05.790" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re really interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.150" end="01:49:07.620" style="s2">mostly to the good I would add a 14th</p>

<p begin="01:49:41.850" end="01:49:48.710" style="s2">would just be wrong I love that one I</p>

<p begin="01:53:27.989" end="01:53:32.730" style="s2">let it find its way in many many</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.360" end="01:53:35.310" style="s2">different ways and explore all the</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.730" end="01:53:37.620" style="s2">possibilities that life or not all but a</p>

<p begin="01:53:44.790" end="01:53:50.070" style="s2">universe which is quite possible the</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.610" end="01:53:52.050" style="s2">other fork of course is that the</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.070" end="01:53:54.210" style="s2">universe is full of intelligent life and</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.050" end="01:53:56.699" style="s2">for various reasons they&#39;re hiding from</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.210" end="01:53:58.679" style="s2">us or are just living in a way that make</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.699" end="01:54:01.800" style="s2">it hard for us to detect the so-called</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.679" end="01:54:03.480" style="s2">Fermi paradox you know which is well</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.800" end="01:54:05.160" style="s2">there&#39;s all these intelligent beings in</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.480" end="01:54:08.160" style="s2">the universe where the hell are they and</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.160" end="01:54:11.670" style="s2">I would say that we should be agnostic</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.160" end="01:54:14.310" style="s2">on that issue but move forward on the as</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.670" end="01:54:17.190" style="s2">if we&#39;re alone trajectory until proven</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.310" end="01:54:19.679" style="s2">otherwise and you know that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.190" end="01:54:21.270" style="s2">very compatible with your view of</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.679" end="01:54:23.850" style="s2">thinking about moving out into the</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.270" end="01:54:26.929" style="s2">universe as a huge positive not as a</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.850" end="01:54:29.640" style="s2">kind of a deprave lifeboat strategy</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.929" end="01:54:32.520" style="s2">mm-hmm totally and moving out into the</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.640" end="01:54:36.679" style="s2">universe only after we&#39;ve gone fully</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.520" end="01:54:41.250" style="s2">within to figure out what values and</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.679" end="01:54:42.739" style="s2">cultural forms and commitments and you</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.250" end="01:54:44.820" style="s2">know that human beings are actually</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.739" end="01:54:49.080" style="s2">bringing to the universe you know</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.820" end="01:54:50.820" style="s2">because I think the fascination with the</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.080" end="01:54:53.040" style="s2">kind of explore exploration of the</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.820" end="01:54:54.570" style="s2">material world and of course space</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.040" end="01:54:56.400" style="s2">exploration is kind of the pinnacle of</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.570" end="01:55:00.000" style="s2">what was already been an impulse with</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.400" end="01:55:03.600" style="s2">human to explore that impulse can also</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.000" end="01:55:05.190" style="s2">be turned within basically and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.600" end="01:55:08.190" style="s2">suggesting that both of those occur</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.190" end="01:55:11.760" style="s2">simultaneously that the universal D</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.190" end="01:55:15.360" style="s2">alienation and rehumanize ation occur</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.760" end="01:55:16.860" style="s2">before we get off the planet because</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.360" end="01:55:19.020" style="s2">otherwise we&#39;re bringing our</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.860" end="01:55:20.940" style="s2">everywhere and it would be a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.020" end="01:55:22.830" style="s2">idea for us to spread it around the</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.940" end="01:55:25.860" style="s2">universe if we hadn&#39;t cleaned it up at</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.830" end="01:55:28.970" style="s2">home first so there&#39;s that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.860" end="01:55:32.660" style="s2">sentiment of like yeah let&#39;s figure out</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.970" end="01:55:34.770" style="s2">how to make it work here before we start</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.660" end="01:55:38.220" style="s2">worrying about what&#39;s out there and then</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.770" end="01:55:41.160" style="s2">what we do go out and explore I mean</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.220" end="01:55:43.650" style="s2">this and interestingly enough like some</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.160" end="01:55:46.200" style="s2">sophisticated religious mystics who were</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.650" end="01:55:47.910" style="s2">aware of modern science like sri</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.200" end="01:55:50.430" style="s2">aurobindo first Sampath great Indian</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.910" end="01:55:52.260" style="s2">mystic and sage he really believed that</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.430" end="01:55:55.020" style="s2">this was the moment of Planet ization</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.260" end="01:55:58.260" style="s2">when the humans went beyond just being</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.020" end="01:56:01.770" style="s2">responsible for the earth and began to</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.260" end="01:56:05.130" style="s2">be part of a larger play in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.770" end="01:56:08.370" style="s2">that required us leaving the earth and</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.130" end="01:56:12.240" style="s2">he believed that this was basically part</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.370" end="01:56:14.550" style="s2">of what was revealed by the level of</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.240" end="01:56:16.200" style="s2">responsibility and maturity that the</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.550" end="01:56:20.240" style="s2">religious traditions were calling the ad</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.200" end="01:56:23.460" style="s2">apps to write that in fact prefigured in</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.240" end="01:56:25.620" style="s2">Christ and Buddha and others were the</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.460" end="01:56:28.200" style="s2">kinds of cultural and personality</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.620" end="01:56:30.510" style="s2">resources necessary to be a species that</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.200" end="01:56:33.120" style="s2">could actually take on a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.510" end="01:56:34.680" style="s2">interplanetary responsibility so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.120" end="01:56:36.270" style="s2">a kind of interesting the way to bring</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.680" end="01:56:39.840" style="s2">this together into what I call sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.270" end="01:56:42.450" style="s2">a religious transhumanism which is not a</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.840" end="01:56:45.210" style="s2">humanism merely of a techno kind of</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.450" end="01:56:47.970" style="s2">technologically optimistic future but</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.210" end="01:56:49.920" style="s2">one in which you know high technology is</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.970" end="01:56:54.200" style="s2">wedded to basically high consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.920" end="01:56:57.780" style="s2">and high aspirational and kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.200" end="01:57:01.230" style="s2">radical maturity insanity then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.780" end="01:57:03.570" style="s2">much more reasonable thing to think that</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.230" end="01:57:04.639" style="s2">humans could actually go and colonize</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.570" end="01:57:09.079" style="s2">other worlds</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.639" end="01:57:12.380" style="s2">right now we can barely survive on this</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.079" end="01:57:14.679" style="s2">one and so it&#39;s looking like the</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.380" end="01:57:17.179" style="s2">near-term space stuff ends up being</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.679" end="01:57:19.489" style="s2">quite dicing it ends up being the</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.179" end="01:57:22.130" style="s2">asteroid mining and the surveillance</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.489" end="01:57:25.369" style="s2">satellites and the super expensive</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.130" end="01:57:26.829" style="s2">billionaire day trips to outer space and</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.369" end="01:57:29.750" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.829" end="01:57:33.349" style="s2">but yeah the only way to have one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.750" end="01:57:36.860" style="s2">I think sustainable in perpetuity is one</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.349" end="01:57:38.270" style="s2">that comes with a kind of ethos that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.860" end="01:57:40.480" style="s2">trying to get at which I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.270" end="01:57:43.909" style="s2">trying to get at so yeah so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.480" end="01:57:47.119" style="s2">incredible potential futures for the</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.909" end="01:57:49.909" style="s2">human and this again I think is part of</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.119" end="01:57:51.889" style="s2">what is hidden within the semantic</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.909" end="01:57:55.639" style="s2">potentials of what&#39;s revealed in the</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.889" end="01:57:58.329" style="s2">mystical Network right that the world</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.639" end="01:58:01.239" style="s2">we&#39;ve known is only the one we&#39;re in now</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.329" end="01:58:04.730" style="s2">that there&#39;s a radical transformation</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.239" end="01:58:07.610" style="s2">and reconfiguration of the human that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.730" end="01:58:09.889" style="s2">coming that&#39;s imminent that will make us</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.610" end="01:58:13.130" style="s2">as different from modern man as modern</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.889" end="01:58:15.020" style="s2">man is from cavemen right and so that</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.130" end="01:58:16.340" style="s2">intuitions been articulated across a</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.020" end="01:58:21.610" style="s2">bunch of religious traditions as the</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.340" end="01:58:26.360" style="s2">apocalypse or you know the zombie on or</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.610" end="01:58:28.550" style="s2">Shambala and etc etc and so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.360" end="01:58:30.320" style="s2">utopian visions which picked up that</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.550" end="01:58:32.150" style="s2">threat and then the concrete utopian</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.320" end="01:58:33.949" style="s2">theorizing which gives us to the 13</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.150" end="01:58:38.360" style="s2">social miracle to what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.949" end="01:58:41.989" style="s2">do is find a way to to to collectively</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.360" end="01:58:46.610" style="s2">you know bear this transition basically</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.989" end="01:58:49.119" style="s2">and yeah I certainly wouldn&#39;t get on a</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.610" end="01:58:52.449" style="s2">space Ark with a bunch of crazy</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.119" end="01:58:54.320" style="s2">billionaires you know I like to say</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.449" end="01:58:56.900" style="s2">because I work in this field of</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.320" end="01:58:58.280" style="s2">existential risk and catastrophic risk</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.900" end="01:58:59.300" style="s2">and civilization of collapse and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.280" end="01:59:02.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like I like to say there is no</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.300" end="01:59:04.579" style="s2">escape hatch no practical one the wall</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.150" end="01:59:06.500" style="s2">if you don&#39;t solve the cultural problem</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.579" end="01:59:08.630" style="s2">then every escape hatch actually brings</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.500" end="01:59:10.309" style="s2">you deeper in because you escape that</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.630" end="01:59:11.690" style="s2">Island with your guards but if you</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.309" end="01:59:13.070" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured out how to actually deal</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.690" end="01:59:16.390" style="s2">with people</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.070" end="01:59:20.050" style="s2">outside of a system of currency where</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.390" end="01:59:22.610" style="s2">enumeration is secured right just people</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.050" end="01:59:25.220" style="s2">then there is no you actually gone</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.610" end="01:59:27.740" style="s2">deeper in to a problematic situation</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.220" end="01:59:31.360" style="s2">precisely about trying to escape</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.740" end="01:59:34.460" style="s2">so yeah they the only way out is through</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.360" end="01:59:36.140" style="s2">together I think that&#39;s a good place to</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.460" end="01:59:38.480" style="s2">end it we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gone as far as we can</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.140" end="01:59:40.970" style="s2">go right I think which is you know that</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.480" end="01:59:43.070" style="s2">we have to you know retune what it means</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.970" end="01:59:45.110" style="s2">to be human in the context of an</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.070" end="01:59:47.420" style="s2">educational system that can replicate</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.110" end="01:59:49.550" style="s2">those good values and refine them going</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.420" end="01:59:53.080" style="s2">forward so that we can go out into the</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.550" end="01:59:55.280" style="s2">universe and do good and not harm yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.080" end="01:59:57.950" style="s2">we come a long way this has been a</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.280" end="01:59:59.450" style="s2">wonderful conversation Zack you know I</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.950" end="02:00:01.970" style="s2">think this is one of the deepest and</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.450" end="02:00:04.460" style="s2">most interesting series of talks I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.970" end="02:00:06.860" style="s2">had on my show and I am pretty sure the</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.460" end="02:00:07.520" style="s2">audience will like it thank you Jim it&#39;s</p>
