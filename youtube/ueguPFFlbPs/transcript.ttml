<p begin="00:00:06.299" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">large portion of my life enjoying my own</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.389" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">inner world in my head or in a world the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:24.680" style="s2">outer world experiencing other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">worlds through books and movies and</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.699" end="00:01:07.339" style="s2">it&#39;s also been replaced by a world a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:07.339" style="s2">different world in my head that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.049" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">possible it&#39;s not based on time travel</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:23.630" style="s2">or aliens coming or futuristic</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:27.689" style="s2">technology that doesn&#39;t exist or magic</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:14.060" style="s2">vast majority of our problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.880" end="00:02:22.120" style="s2">in a way that people get it where they</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t able to see it like I do to feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.120" end="00:02:32.380" style="s2">it like I do I can explain in little</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:39.300" style="s2">bits the house I&#39;d the logical here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:46.150" end="00:02:52.690" style="s2">supposed to be and not which is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.290" end="00:02:57.580" style="s2">ongoing theme for me especially at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.690" end="00:03:00.190" style="s2">moment needing to be not need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.580" end="00:03:05.620" style="s2">anything just accepting exactly who I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.190" end="00:03:11.140" style="s2">my abilities my limitations my desires</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.620" end="00:03:14.680" style="s2">my propulsions like just acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.140" end="00:03:18.570" style="s2">that these things exist and accepting</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.680" end="00:03:21.790" style="s2">them and realizing how much of Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.570" end="00:03:23.410" style="s2">the dark side the light side the</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.090" end="00:03:29.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a fun journey to discover for all</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.520" end="00:03:30.490" style="s2">those little things along the way like</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.320" end="00:03:31.870" style="s2">when you get to the end of a book and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.490" end="00:03:33.820" style="s2">then you reread it and you see all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.870" end="00:03:36.459" style="s2">little the little pieces that led you up</p>
