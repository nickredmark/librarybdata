<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">the wrong way up and I think climate</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">change is a bit like this were we able</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do here is provide</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:17.369" style="s2">something akin to a map at the end you</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">should be able to read four things on</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.369" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">that map the first is where we are the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">second is where we will end up if we do</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">nothing the third is where we should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">headed and the fourth is the minimum</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:31.470" style="s2">conditions necessary to change in order</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">to get on that trajectory now I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.470" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve raised some questions amongst many</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">of you why isn&#39;t evolutionary theorist</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">talking about climate change it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:41.400" style="s2">if the climate evolves in the Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">sense and that&#39;s true but I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.400" end="00:01:46.829" style="s2">argue that climate change is not really</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">a problem it&#39;s more a symptom of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.829" end="00:01:52.049" style="s2">problem a problem that caused the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">financial collapse of 2008 caused the</p>

<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">in 2010 and the ongoing Fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">disaster starting in March of 2011 if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">these events then we are liable to reach</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">for the wrong solutions at best those</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:13.350" style="s2">solutions will be ineffective at worst</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:14.700" style="s2">they may even be harmful now</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.350" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">my contention that evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.700" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">something to do with this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">involves the claim that there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">cultural evolution affecting markets</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">which is in and of itself not a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">particularly radical argument there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:28.440" style="s2">after all a fledgling field called</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:31.970" style="s2">evolutionary economics that proceeds</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.440" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">roughly from that premise but those</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.970" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">attempts to map evolutionary theory on</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">to economics tend to proceed from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:40.470" style="s2">economic side and they often miss</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">something about the Darwinian subtleties</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.470" end="00:02:44.340" style="s2">that might be included if they came from</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:46.260" style="s2">the biological side so the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.340" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">important thing we can do here today is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.260" end="00:02:52.590" style="s2">get the mapping correct so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:55.110" style="s2">understand the implications there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.590" end="00:02:57.240" style="s2">four necessary and sufficient conditions</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.110" end="00:03:00.210" style="s2">to produce adaptive evolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.240" end="00:03:02.460" style="s2">Darwinian type they are hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.210" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">each one depends on the ones above they</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.460" end="00:03:07.410" style="s2">are reproduction variation between the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">products of reproduction heritability of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.410" end="00:03:11.910" style="s2">those variants and differential success</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:14.430" style="s2">amongst them any system that has those</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.910" end="00:03:16.710" style="s2">things will adaptively evolve whether it</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.430" end="00:03:20.790" style="s2">is algorithms in a virtual environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.710" end="00:03:22.980" style="s2">or whether it is rabbits on a prairie so</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.790" end="00:03:25.350" style="s2">the question is how can those things</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.980" end="00:03:28.170" style="s2">function in the economic context the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.350" end="00:03:30.020" style="s2">temptation is to imagine that agents</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.170" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">within the market people or companies</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.020" end="00:03:35.070" style="s2">evolve within the ecosystem that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">provided by the market and I see two</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.070" end="00:03:39.540" style="s2">failures there the first is that those</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:41.400" style="s2">agents companies and individuals don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.540" end="00:03:43.940" style="s2">really reproduce and that calls into</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.400" end="00:03:46.680" style="s2">question all four of these criteria I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.940" end="00:03:49.290" style="s2">would argue instead that we should look</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.680" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">at strategies evolving culturally within</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.290" end="00:03:54.270" style="s2">the market the strategies really</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:54.750" style="s2">reproduce they do let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.270" end="00:03:57.650" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.750" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">the Xerox Corporation innovated a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.650" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">graphical user interface driven by Mouse</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">the Apple Corporation adopted that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">enhanced it they built up the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:10.290" style="s2">and made it more useful the Microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:12.240" style="s2">Corporation took apples graphical user</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.290" end="00:04:14.970" style="s2">interface and they broadened it by</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.240" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">making it run on a wider variety of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.970" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">machines so you have reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:21.690" style="s2">heritable variation and differential</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:23.550" style="s2">success and in that context we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.690" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">imagine that the ecosystem in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.550" end="00:04:26.730" style="s2">those strategies used by agents evolve</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:29.820" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.730" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">market but what we need to understand in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.820" end="00:04:33.930" style="s2">order to see this puzzle is that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:35.970" style="s2">boundaries of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.930" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">environment do not stop at the markets</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.970" end="00:04:41.640" style="s2">edge what do we make of the company that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:44.190" style="s2">innovates a strategy of persuading the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.640" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">legislature to give up a subsidy for</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.190" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">some sort of activity now if that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:51.270" style="s2">activity is useless or harmful we may</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:53.370" style="s2">find that activity and athma but from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.270" end="00:04:54.930" style="s2">Darwinian perspective it&#39;s every bit as</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.370" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">much a strategy as the graphical user</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.930" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">interface so my contention is strategies</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:08.670" style="s2">evolve within markets and their larger</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:09.690" style="s2">regulatory context in the story I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.670" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">told you with the graphical user</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.690" end="00:05:15.300" style="s2">interface we see a classic tale of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:17.100" style="s2">enhanced utility where the pie grows as</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.300" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">the result of some sort of an insight</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.100" end="00:05:21.030" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very positive thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:23.100" style="s2">what is classically imagined to produce</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.030" end="00:05:26.760" style="s2">profits in a market there are many</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.100" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">examples here we have the first step on</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.760" end="00:05:30.600" style="s2">the road that eventually led to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:34.260" style="s2">modern bicycle this is the dandy horse</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.600" end="00:05:35.670" style="s2">of 1817 its originally imagined as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.260" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">aid to walking and it&#39;s practically</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.670" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">useless this is the uncomfortable and</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:51.150" style="s2">this is the useful but very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:52.620" style="s2">penny farthing and finally in 1885 we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.150" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">get the emergence of the safety bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.620" end="00:05:57.900" style="s2">and it is fantastic it is so fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:01.170" style="s2">in fact that it is the reason that the</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.950" end="00:06:20.310" style="s2">supposed to work that&#39;s how these</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.970" end="00:06:21.810" style="s2">strategies are supposed to evolve but we</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.310" end="00:06:24.360" style="s2">can also recognize in the bicycle</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.340" end="00:06:50.490" style="s2">so the bicycle industry has had many</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.490" end="00:06:55.110" style="s2">important but it&#39;s also had long periods</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.470" end="00:06:56.490" style="s2">of the doldrums when it had to monkey</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.110" end="00:06:58.140" style="s2">around with gimmicks to sell people</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.490" end="00:07:02.790" style="s2">things they didn&#39;t really need in order</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.790" end="00:07:07.830" style="s2">years it has begun monkeying around with</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.710" end="00:08:29.400" style="s2">nonetheless we have to ask ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.270" end="00:09:01.950" style="s2">our initial instinct as human beings is</p>

<p begin="00:09:03.630" end="00:09:07.110" style="s2">that didn&#39;t naturally belong to them but</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.880" end="00:09:10.620" style="s2">I would argue that something of a</p>

<p begin="00:09:21.839" end="00:09:24.810" style="s2">the opportunity is there and if you</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.810" end="00:09:30.150" style="s2">blood you have to close down the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.100" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2">opportunity so let&#39;s look at a thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.150" end="00:09:33.690" style="s2">experiment about how evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:36.150" style="s2">strategies in markets would function on</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.690" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">the left you have a benevolent</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.730" end="00:09:51.089" style="s2">realistic it&#39;s a mixed strategy there</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.650" end="00:09:52.589" style="s2">are some costs that will inflict on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.089" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">public there are some costs that go too</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.589" end="00:09:54.779" style="s2">far and it tries to balance those</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">concerns</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.779" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">now imagine that these companies face a</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:04.110" style="s2">occasionally those choices will make</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.890" end="00:10:05.700" style="s2">what&#39;s good for society exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.110" end="00:10:08.580" style="s2">as what is good for the company in which</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.930" end="00:10:13.890" style="s2">competition but most choices aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.750" end="00:10:17.130" style="s2">going to look like that there will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.890" end="00:10:19.260" style="s2">equally rare ones in which what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.130" end="00:10:20.910" style="s2">for society is exactly the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.260" end="00:10:22.770" style="s2">what is good for the company in which</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.140" end="00:10:29.640" style="s2">common case will be somewhere in between</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.930" style="s2">and in this case we see why evolution in</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.920" end="00:12:45.720" style="s2">individuals that when people hear about</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.830" end="00:12:47.790" style="s2">climate change and the harms that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.720" end="00:12:49.290" style="s2">does they very naturally want to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.790" end="00:12:50.640" style="s2">something they want to limit their</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.290" end="00:12:52.770" style="s2">contribution</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.640" end="00:12:54.600" style="s2">that danger they want to restrain their</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.770" end="00:12:57.210" style="s2">own behavior reduce their carbon</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.600" end="00:13:00.960" style="s2">footprint but paradoxically the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.210" end="00:13:03.150" style="s2">individual in the market by spending</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.960" end="00:13:05.070" style="s2">more for more responsible products is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.150" end="00:13:07.290" style="s2">actually reducing their influence on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.070" end="00:13:09.030" style="s2">system and causing the system to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.290" end="00:13:11.580" style="s2">more quickly in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.030" end="00:13:14.100" style="s2">ruthlessness now there I call this the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.580" end="00:13:16.530" style="s2">personal responsibility vortex it sucks</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.100" end="00:13:19.530" style="s2">good people in and it has two logical</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.530" end="00:13:22.080" style="s2">consequences the first is that we should</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.530" end="00:13:23.480" style="s2">redirect any effort that we are tempted</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.080" end="00:13:26.070" style="s2">to spend on personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.480" end="00:13:27.630" style="s2">towards collective action towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.070" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">collective action that can restructure</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.630" end="00:13:31.410" style="s2">the incentives that surround the market</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">so that we actually have a chance of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.410" end="00:13:36.180" style="s2">altering the behavior the second logical</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:38.610" style="s2">consequence is that there are two types</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.180" end="00:13:40.200" style="s2">of systems that we can have one type of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.610" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">system the costs of sustaining the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.200" end="00:13:44.940" style="s2">system go to the benevolent that system</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:47.220" style="s2">will inevitably evolve towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.940" end="00:13:48.960" style="s2">ruthlessness and instability the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.220" end="00:13:51.210" style="s2">Converse system though one where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.960" end="00:13:53.520" style="s2">costs of maintaining society go to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.210" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">ruthless evolves towards benevolence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.520" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">stability</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.920" style="s2">whenever policy is in question we should</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:14:00.420" style="s2">ask ourselves does the policy lead in</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.920" end="00:14:05.910" style="s2">the direction of the one type or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.420" end="00:14:08.040" style="s2">other if we want to rescue our system</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.910" end="00:14:10.620" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to do some radical</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.040" end="00:14:12.510" style="s2">things the first thing we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.620" end="00:14:15.090" style="s2">we need to place a firewall that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.510" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">impermeable between the marketplace and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.090" end="00:14:21.510" style="s2">the regulatory apparatus it is no</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:23.310" style="s2">problem that people make money in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.510" end="00:14:25.590" style="s2">marketplace there is nothing wrong when</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.310" end="00:14:27.990" style="s2">someone creates utility then being</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.590" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">rewarded for it the problem is when that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.990" end="00:14:34.830" style="s2">reward begins to generate its own</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">rewards positive feedback sets in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.830" end="00:14:38.640" style="s2">second thing we have to do is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:41.610" style="s2">rethink the way we keep track of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.640" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">behavior in the marketplace we need full</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.610" end="00:14:45.750" style="s2">cost accounting which means that every</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.190" style="s2">cost that is generated by an activity in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.750" end="00:14:49.140" style="s2">the market needs to show up on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.190" end="00:14:50.850" style="s2">balance sheet whether that is borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.140" end="00:14:53.010" style="s2">from future generations whether it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.850" end="00:14:55.230" style="s2">putting the population at risk</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.010" end="00:14:57.210" style="s2">whatever the cost of an activity are be</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.230" end="00:14:58.620" style="s2">they&#39;ve military or otherwise they need</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.210" end="00:15:01.350" style="s2">to be included in the price of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.620" end="00:15:04.080" style="s2">product or otherwise returned to those</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.350" end="00:15:04.650" style="s2">who decided to initiate the action if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.080" end="00:15:07.620" style="s2">did that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.650" end="00:15:09.810" style="s2">the amount of economic activity would</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.620" end="00:15:11.640" style="s2">drop but it would drop to exactly those</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.810" end="00:15:13.800" style="s2">behaviors that are actually beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.640" end="00:15:15.870" style="s2">to society leaving out all of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.800" end="00:15:20.400" style="s2">externalities that are generating so</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.870" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">much profit with our current system now</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.400" end="00:15:23.880" style="s2">I began this by saying that I thought we</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:25.650" style="s2">would think very differently about</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.880" end="00:15:28.530" style="s2">climate change if we could look at our</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.650" end="00:15:31.290" style="s2">possible futures I also have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.530" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">sense about the past the sense is if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.290" end="00:15:35.460" style="s2">could show the people who architected</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:37.170" style="s2">our system the way the system would come</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.460" end="00:15:39.630" style="s2">apart in the end they might have</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:41.550" style="s2">protected us better the founding fathers</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.630" end="00:15:43.410" style="s2">never saw a bicycle they probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.550" end="00:15:44.640" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have imagined a chainsaw they</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.410" end="00:15:46.950" style="s2">certainly could not have foreseen</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.640" end="00:15:49.620" style="s2">hyaline logging mountaintop removal</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.950" end="00:15:52.140" style="s2">mining they couldn&#39;t have imagined deep</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.140" end="00:15:55.590" style="s2">see those things</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.920" end="00:15:57.000" style="s2">my guess is sustainability would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.590" end="00:15:59.880" style="s2">been at the top of their list of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.000" end="00:16:02.190" style="s2">concerns I&#39;m thinking it might even have</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.880" end="00:16:04.890" style="s2">ended up as our first amendment in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.190" end="00:16:09.210" style="s2">Bill of Rights how cool would it be if</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.890" end="00:16:11.310" style="s2">our Bill of Rights went to 11 no really</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.210" end="00:16:13.380" style="s2">how cool would it be if our Bill of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.310" end="00:16:15.180" style="s2">Rights went to 11 yes I think they would</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.380" end="00:16:19.650" style="s2">have been very focused on sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.180" end="00:16:23.930" style="s2">and reversibility unfortunately there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.650" end="00:16:23.930" style="s2">no mechanism to deliver them the map</p>
