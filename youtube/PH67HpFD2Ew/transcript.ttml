<p begin="00:00:05.380" end="00:00:05.880" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.780" end="00:00:09.080" style="s2">A couple things I want to tell you about today</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.460" end="00:00:11.640" style="s2">Many things I want to tell you about</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.540" end="00:00:14.840" style="s2">I want to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:15.980" style="s2">Uhm</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.060" end="00:00:21.180" style="s2">I want to give you a schema that is going to enable you to understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.180" end="00:00:24.220" style="s2">I think it will enable you to understand stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.220" end="00:00:26.780" style="s2">Like the one I told you last time, you remember Jonah and the whale</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:33.740" style="s2">I want to provide you with the schema so you can understand stories like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.240" end="00:00:35.960" style="s2">But many many more stories like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:39.100" style="s2">Partly what I am telling you about today</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.100" end="00:00:41.020" style="s2">In some sense are archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.900" end="00:00:50.440" style="s2">And an archetype, it is an idea that was made most popular over the last 100 years by Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.780" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">But it&#39;s a much older idea than that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:54.080" style="s2">It&#39;s really a platonic idea in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.260" end="00:00:57.140" style="s2">And it means something like fundamental pattern</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:00.500" style="s2">And so an archetype manifests itself in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.500" end="00:01:02.540" style="s2">It could be a pattern of emotional response</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.540" end="00:01:03.940" style="s2">Like it can be something you are feeling</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.940" end="00:01:07.060" style="s2">It could be the way that emotional response displays itself</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.060" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">On your body, on your face</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.900" end="00:01:14.780" style="s2">It could be the way that emotion feels and displays itself on your face</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.980" end="00:01:19.720" style="s2">And plays itself out as a drama in your local environment</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:23.400" style="s2">So like an angry argument is an archetypical phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.400" end="00:01:25.300" style="s2">And the reason it&#39;s archetypical is because</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.540" end="00:01:32.940" style="s2">Well, you have them, you have them, you have them, you have them, everyone has them</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.160" end="00:01:37.080" style="s2">and so you can&#39;t  really think about them as individual, you have to think about them as universal</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.080" end="00:01:40.540" style="s2">and you can&#39;t think as about something that you created in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">although, in a sense you do</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s also as something that happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:49.580" style="s2">now, when you read about Jung and archetype is quite confusing because you can never be sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:57.080" style="s2">whether it&#39;s talking about an instinct, an emotion, a motivational system, or a sub-personality</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.120" end="00:02:04.480" style="s2">or a sub-personality in which these things manifest itself, or even the social drama that&#39;s being played out</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.480" end="00:02:06.720" style="s2">in time and space in the social world</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.720" end="00:02:09.900" style="s2">but a real archetype I would say is all of those things at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.160" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">Now, we use archetypal means of expression to represent how we act</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">And that&#39;s not the same thing as we think representing what the world is made out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:24.820" style="s2">It&#39;s a very different thing, so you could say in some sense we tell stories and understand stories</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.820" end="00:02:28.060" style="s2">so that we can figure out how people act and how they should act</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.060" end="00:02:31.520" style="s2">and then we conduct science so that we can figure out what the world&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.520" end="00:02:34.100" style="s2">from a material objective perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.660" end="00:02:36.820" style="s2">the two things coexist uneasily</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.820" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">I think the more primary form of knowledge is actually how to act with a scientific model nested inside</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">because the most important question you have to solve as a living organism isn&#39;t what the world is made out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:50.580" style="s2">it&#39;s how you should act in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.580" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">say from a darwinian perspective even</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:55.480" style="s2">so that you can live long enough to reproduce.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.960" end="00:02:59.480" style="s2">that&#39;s basicly from a strict biological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.720" end="00:03:03.960" style="s2">in some sense that&#39;s what you have to do in order to be successful</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.960" end="00:03:05.320" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of obvious</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.320" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">first of all &#39;cause you are not very successful if you just go and die</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:14.920" style="s2">and then, of course, death from a genetic perspective and failing to leave offspring are much the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:20.960" style="s2">Now, one of the questions might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.800" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">how is that we conceive of the world as a place to act in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.960" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly I&#39;m gonna tell on the hypothesis for you and then explain the significance of that hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:40.800" style="s2">and the hypothesis involves the description of what you might consider consitituent elements</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:43.960" style="s2">and also transformation processes</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">as far as I can tell, the constituent elements of the stories that we tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.960" end="00:03:52.800" style="s2">about how the people act and should act are characters</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.800" end="00:03:57.640" style="s2">Now that makes sense, right, because  you really can&#39;t have a drama or story without characters</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.120" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">Now, the thing is that characters have to be understandable</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2">and so, for them to be understandable they sort of have to be like you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:09.080" style="s2">or they have to be like someone you know, but they have to be human</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.080" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">but than again it&#39;s not exactly that they&#39;re human, because</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.600" style="s2">even when you&#39;re telling a story about what happened to you today</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.920" end="00:04:19.960" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to think about what you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">so someone might say &quot;well, how is your day?&quot;, and you say &quot;fine&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">i mean, maybe it&#39;s the lowest level, lowest resolution highest abstract srory</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.480" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">&quot;my day was fine&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">It&#39;s pretty boring story, it&#39;s better then terrible, I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not interesting, it&#39;s not detailed</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:43.340" style="s2">but person gets the notion that things went according to plan</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:46.700" style="s2">or, more specificly, that things unfolded the way you wanted them to</p>
