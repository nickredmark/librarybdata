<p begin="00:00:05.210" end="00:00:09.630" style="s2">this is the first in a series of films</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.529" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">that we&#39;re making looking at what are</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">the deeper issues that this pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:15.870" style="s2">this growing crisis is bringing up and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">this first one is gonna be about</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.870" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">complexity and systems thinking the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">systems and complexity people saw it</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">first because they were actually looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">at how all these different fragilities</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:31.289" style="s2">across different systems were providing</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">a perfect storm it was coming and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.289" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">happened to be a pandemic it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:37.170" style="s2">that is being really highlighted with</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.170" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">had what initially started as a medical</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">crisis cascading into an economic crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">whose noting knock-on effect in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">education system and all of these other</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:50.219" style="s2">systems so what it&#39;s doing is really</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">showing and I think giving people a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.219" end="00:00:55.320" style="s2">visceral direct experience and what a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:00:56.579" style="s2">lot of systems thinkers and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">theorists have been talking about for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.579" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">very long time how it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.890" end="00:01:03.989" style="s2">to look at anything in isolation because</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">it&#39;s automatically interrelated with</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.989" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">lots of other systems so one thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:09.689" style="s2">really noticed is that there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">tangible difference between thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.689" end="00:01:12.619" style="s2">talking about complexity and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:14.100" style="s2">the models and knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.619" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">theoretically everything is</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.100" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">interconnected and then the lived</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">experience of it in our own lives and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve really noticed that I remember just</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">you know going to the shop and one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:25.920" style="s2">the kind of every ten day shops that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:27.509" style="s2">have been doing and noticing the line</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:29.700" style="s2">outside and then you know being in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.509" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">shop and just being hyper aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:33.329" style="s2">fragility of our supply chains you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">starting to wonder how much of this food</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">is grown in the UK and how much you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:39.920" style="s2">all of those questions become extremely</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">real and it&#39;s for me visceral and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.920" end="00:01:44.220" style="s2">think many of us were all experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">it in real time so what was hidden</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.220" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">before is is now all all being laid bare</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">and sort of the the underlying source</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">code of society is suddenly becoming</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">obvious and clear and one thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">noticing is that it is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">fragile and with that comes a huge</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">question of what do we do and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">also the question of why our</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">institutions and our leaders were so</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">seemingly unprepared seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:10.050" style="s2">blindsided by it and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">that has to do with not thinking in kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">of terms of complexity in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">systems so in this film</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.570" style="s2">three interviews with some amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:19.560" style="s2">complex thinkers got Jim rut who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.570" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">former chairman of the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.560" end="00:02:23.220" style="s2">Institute Joe Brewer who&#39;s kind of made</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:26.310" style="s2">a name for himself as something of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.220" end="00:02:28.410" style="s2">collapse ologist and Nora Bateson so</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.310" end="00:02:29.880" style="s2">Nora is the daughter of Gregory Bateson</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.410" end="00:02:32.460" style="s2">who&#39;s a kind of legendary figure from</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.880" end="00:02:34.140" style="s2">the 1970s and came up with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.460" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">concepts that are still being used by</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.140" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">people in this area and she&#39;s keeping</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:38.910" style="s2">his work alive through the Bateson</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:40.890" style="s2">Institute looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.910" end="00:02:43.020" style="s2">interrelatedness of things and something</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.890" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">she calls warm data which is that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.020" end="00:02:46.020" style="s2">cannot take data out of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:48.120" style="s2">make sense of it because it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.020" end="00:02:50.940" style="s2">part of a living system on the Gullah</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.120" end="00:02:53.310" style="s2">understand it as such and she talked in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.940" end="00:02:55.170" style="s2">the interview about Cassandra which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.310" end="00:02:58.890" style="s2">the Greek myth about the prophet who was</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.170" end="00:03:00.600" style="s2">fated to be right but disbelieved and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">what are the key things that maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.600" end="00:03:05.580" style="s2">need to learn from complexity and since</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:07.380" style="s2">systems thinking that will help us</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.580" end="00:03:10.500" style="s2">understand and maybe get out of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.380" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">crisis or maybe use this crisis to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.500" end="00:03:16.860" style="s2">transition to something better than the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:17.730" style="s2">system that come didn&#39;t see it coming in</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.860" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.730" end="00:03:21.959" style="s2">you know in particular I could name some</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:26.850" style="s2">of the people who were the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.959" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">Cassandra&#39;s in this case and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">the curse of Cassandra is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:37.080" style="s2">see the future but to have no one</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">believe you and I think e if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.080" end="00:03:42.810" style="s2">looking at multiple systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:44.880" style="s2">simultaneously and complexity thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">have been actually as systems thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.880" end="00:03:50.390" style="s2">have been saying for decades I mean not</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:55.070" style="s2">just right before this but for decades</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.390" end="00:03:58.530" style="s2">that there is an incredible destructive</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.070" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">fragility and not just one of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.530" end="00:04:03.270" style="s2">systems like it&#39;s not just the education</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:05.340" style="s2">system it&#39;s not just the economy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.270" end="00:04:09.270" style="s2">not just the health care system it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.340" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">just the political system it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.270" end="00:04:16.430" style="s2">just that the ruled way technology is in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:19.190" style="s2">our lives it&#39;s all of those systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.430" end="00:04:22.109" style="s2">simultaneously and more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.190" end="00:04:23.940" style="s2">their fragility is in the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.940" end="00:04:29.670" style="s2">okay so unless there were people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:32.010" style="s2">were kind of composers right people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.670" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">are looking at the way all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.010" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">instruments in the orchestra are coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">together to form the music what one ends</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:47.480" style="s2">up seeing is various different scores</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:50.730" style="s2">for different instruments so you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.480" end="00:04:53.370" style="s2">experts in health care experts in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.730" end="00:04:55.850" style="s2">education experts in the economy experts</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.370" end="00:04:58.680" style="s2">in political work you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.850" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">anthropologists you have media and tech</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.680" end="00:05:08.010" style="s2">people and everybody is given their</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:15.170" style="s2">authorisation their credibility by their</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.010" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">expertise in their particular zone and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.170" end="00:05:20.910" style="s2">not very many people were traveling</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.880" end="00:05:23.040" style="s2">between those zones and when they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.910" end="00:05:27.780" style="s2">traveling between them a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.040" end="00:05:31.590" style="s2">were caught in a kind of need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.780" end="00:05:35.730" style="s2">their own bills and in doing so they</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.590" end="00:05:39.660" style="s2">kind of had to provide a way for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.730" end="00:05:41.669" style="s2">existing system to continue right it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.660" end="00:05:43.380" style="s2">the the kind of the curse of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.669" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">thinker that you couldn&#39;t walk into an</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.380" end="00:05:49.490" style="s2">organization or a Ministry of Health or</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:53.310" style="s2">the education or the Department of of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.490" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">whatever and say actually this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.310" end="00:05:59.490" style="s2">screwed we need to we need to completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:06:01.110" style="s2">restructure this in conjunction with all</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.490" end="00:06:05.430" style="s2">these other people that you never talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.110" end="00:06:07.980" style="s2">to and that job was impossible to get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.430" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2">it was just it was just out of reach so</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.980" end="00:06:16.500" style="s2">there were a lot of us who have for</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:18.570" style="s2">decades been saying you know in one way</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:21.419" style="s2">or another whether it&#39;s ecological</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.570" end="00:06:24.570" style="s2">crisis or economic crisis or culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.419" end="00:06:28.440" style="s2">political crisis or a pandemic or a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.570" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">nuclear war or a hora hora hora like it</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.440" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">could have been any number of systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.500" end="00:06:43.969" style="s2">systems trigger</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.469" end="00:06:45.830" style="s2">and and it in a way now I have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.969" end="00:06:48.139" style="s2">preface this by saying there are people</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.830" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">that are very dear to my heart who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.139" end="00:06:55.129" style="s2">in ICU beds right now so I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:57.789" style="s2">this lightly but I&#39;m really glad that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.129" end="00:07:01.340" style="s2">there is the moment to perceive these</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.789" end="00:07:03.770" style="s2">inter systemic fragilities and that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.340" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">trajectories of the way all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.770" end="00:07:12.439" style="s2">different contexts of our world were</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.830" end="00:07:18.409" style="s2">going was leading to disaster it always</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.439" end="00:07:20.719" style="s2">was so in a way I&#39;m I&#39;m relieved that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.409" end="00:07:25.939" style="s2">have this and not a nuclear war to wake</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.719" end="00:07:29.479" style="s2">us up but that doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.939" end="00:07:33.409" style="s2">really give much consolation in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.479" end="00:07:36.169" style="s2">moment when you&#39;re with your I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.409" end="00:07:38.180" style="s2">you know having to deal with people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.169" end="00:07:41.719" style="s2">are right on the edge of life right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.180" end="00:07:44.360" style="s2">so I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t say those</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.719" end="00:07:47.689" style="s2">words lately and I&#39;m not one for the you</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.689" end="00:07:53.330" style="s2">moment of oh this is going to be such an</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:58.839" style="s2">opportunity because I think maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.330" end="00:08:04.219" style="s2">that opportunistic attitude is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.839" end="00:08:07.009" style="s2">harkening a kind of way of perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.219" end="00:08:09.949" style="s2">that lacks the sensitivity that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.009" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">actually need to to move into</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.949" end="00:08:16.399" style="s2">possibilities that are there we need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">be angry we need to be sad we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.399" end="00:08:22.610" style="s2">awake we need to be broken open all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:26.120" style="s2">us even the systems and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.610" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">experts write the script all scripts are</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.120" end="00:08:34.810" style="s2">not useful now so I guess I&#39;m going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:36.550" style="s2">and on but the system sinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.810" end="00:08:38.830" style="s2">like city people saw it first because</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.550" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">they were actually looking at how all</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.830" end="00:08:45.700" style="s2">these different fragilities across</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:48.400" style="s2">different systems were providing a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.700" end="00:08:51.130" style="s2">perfect storm and it was something was</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.400" end="00:08:52.330" style="s2">gonna was gonna trigger it I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.130" end="00:08:55.210" style="s2">of people thought it was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.330" end="00:09:01.779" style="s2">ecological disaster or maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.210" end="00:09:04.830" style="s2">mass migration or food security it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.779" end="00:09:07.300" style="s2">coming and it happened to be a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.830" end="00:09:09.370" style="s2">Anora was hinting and there why this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.300" end="00:09:12.190" style="s2">such a deep crisis it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.370" end="00:09:14.440" style="s2">crisis of medical system the economic</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.190" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">system it&#39;s in some ways a crisis of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.440" end="00:09:18.900" style="s2">entire Western Way of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:21.640" style="s2">world in this very kind of atomistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.900" end="00:09:24.279" style="s2">deterministic kind of way and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.640" end="00:09:25.540" style="s2">to be what I think we&#39;ve been pointing</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.279" end="00:09:26.860" style="s2">to since the beginning of the channel</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.540" end="00:09:28.300" style="s2">with rebel wisdom it&#39;s like no there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.860" end="00:09:30.730" style="s2">crisis when the Western Way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.300" end="00:09:32.110" style="s2">at the world and we need to we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.730" end="00:09:34.690" style="s2">take a step back we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.110" end="00:09:36.339" style="s2">think in different ways in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.690" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">become of different kinds of people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.339" end="00:09:39.880" style="s2">make sense of the world yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:42.070" style="s2">actually just before the crisis we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.880" end="00:09:43.660" style="s2">exploring this in a lost ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.070" end="00:09:45.940" style="s2">and it was that it&#39;s not that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.660" end="00:09:47.890" style="s2">anything inherently wrong with with</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.940" end="00:09:51.400" style="s2">atomizing things and seeing them in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.890" end="00:09:53.020" style="s2">way it&#39;s an important skill to have it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.400" end="00:09:55.560" style="s2">just that we over rely on that way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.020" end="00:09:58.120" style="s2">knowing so extremely that it blinds us</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.560" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">both John drove a key and in McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.120" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">who we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had in the channel a few</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:03.400" style="s2">times have different models that explain</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">why that kind of narrowing of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.400" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">perception happens and why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">detrimental especially for you know to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.490" style="s2">draw on what Nora is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:14.290" style="s2">zooming out and seeing the whole and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.490" end="00:10:18.250" style="s2">just even the concept of seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.290" end="00:10:20.230" style="s2">as interconnected and provisional even</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.250" end="00:10:21.850" style="s2">that isn&#39;t really represented very well</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.230" end="00:10:23.320" style="s2">in the ways of knowing that we rely on</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.850" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">very heavily for you know for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.320" end="00:10:27.730" style="s2">science and history very what for vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:29.830" style="s2">called propositional it&#39;s about knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.730" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">that so they&#39;re important but we also</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.830" end="00:10:33.490" style="s2">have to have other ways of seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">like for example you know Nora talks</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.490" end="00:10:37.930" style="s2">about warm data seeing things in context</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:39.459" style="s2">you know things like aesthetic myth</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.930" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of different ways we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.459" end="00:10:43.390" style="s2">start tapping into different types of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:45.339" style="s2">information that that serve as well so</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.390" end="00:10:46.570" style="s2">next I spoke to Jim rut who is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.339" end="00:10:47.800" style="s2">former chairman of the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.570" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">Institute which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.800" end="00:10:51.399" style="s2">is one of the places that has really</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:54.010" style="s2">pioneered complexity research and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.399" end="00:10:55.779" style="s2">systems thinking and he is also very</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.010" end="00:10:59.050" style="s2">influential and was actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.779" end="00:11:00.850" style="s2">the prime mover in creating the initial</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.050" end="00:11:01.990" style="s2">game B movement which we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.850" end="00:11:03.339" style="s2">quite a bit on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.990" end="00:11:04.839" style="s2">he brought a load of people together</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.339" end="00:11:07.000" style="s2">something actually making a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.839" end="00:11:09.220" style="s2">about at the moment and I interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.000" end="00:11:11.790" style="s2">him back in October last year for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.220" end="00:11:15.160" style="s2">new for the documentary about game B and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.790" end="00:11:17.620" style="s2">he said this which I think now seems</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.160" end="00:11:19.779" style="s2">quite prescient and we talked a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.620" end="00:11:21.339" style="s2">bit before starting about the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.779" end="00:11:23.140" style="s2">attractor which i think is really really</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.339" end="00:11:24.910" style="s2">interesting at the moment when with</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.140" end="00:11:27.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole resurgence of interest</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.910" end="00:11:30.550" style="s2">in Game B and in this kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.779" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">potential system might come next can you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.550" end="00:11:34.209" style="s2">outline that from the beginning so</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">here&#39;s the story of the fifth attractor</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.209" end="00:11:40.060" style="s2">using complexity science we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:41.529" style="s2">basins of attraction or strange</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.060" end="00:11:42.970" style="s2">attractors some people call them so</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.529" end="00:11:45.100" style="s2">think about all the things that make our</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.970" end="00:11:46.750" style="s2">society what it is our social operating</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.100" end="00:11:50.200" style="s2">system think of it being like a metal</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.750" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">bowl and then think a marble in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.200" end="00:11:54.100" style="s2">bowl as the current state of that system</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:56.140" style="s2">and the marble rolls around in the bowl</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.100" end="00:11:58.950" style="s2">we go from more conservative to more</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.140" end="00:12:01.180" style="s2">liberal more Victorian to more</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.950" end="00:12:02.470" style="s2">emancipated you know in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.180" end="00:12:04.540" style="s2">different so the marble is always moving</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.470" end="00:12:06.130" style="s2">around but it&#39;s also periodically moving</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.540" end="00:12:10.120" style="s2">up the side of the bowl towards the edge</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.130" end="00:12:13.890" style="s2">and so far hasn&#39;t flowed out if we want</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.120" end="00:12:17.800" style="s2">to say our current system started in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.890" end="00:12:18.940" style="s2">1694 the day i happened the year i</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.800" end="00:12:20.350" style="s2">happened to give for the start of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.940" end="00:12:22.029" style="s2">current system it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.350" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">you pick other ones but the marble has</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.029" end="00:12:27.459" style="s2">never flown out of the bowl since then I</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:31.180" style="s2">have some reasons to believe that it may</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.459" end="00:12:33.459" style="s2">well that whether they&#39;re whether that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.180" end="00:12:35.020" style="s2">we reach the limits of our ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.459" end="00:12:36.610" style="s2">that&#39;s one way that the marble could fly</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.020" end="00:12:38.380" style="s2">out of the thing very quickly then</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.610" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">there&#39;s other ways you look at the ever</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.380" end="00:12:44.260" style="s2">growing inequality of wealth and power</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:46.060" style="s2">in our societies I&#39;m hearing the Clank</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.260" end="00:12:47.640" style="s2">of the guillotine more and more every</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.060" end="00:12:50.680" style="s2">day or getting to the levels of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.640" end="00:12:53.550" style="s2">inequality and unfairness in our society</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.680" end="00:12:55.750" style="s2">or historically people have revolted and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.550" end="00:12:57.910" style="s2">overthrown the powers that be could</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.750" end="00:13:00.250" style="s2">easily happen there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.910" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">resurgence of some religious craziness</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.250" end="00:13:03.160" style="s2">right we see surprise</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:05.650" style="s2">the amount that of that running around</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:08.590" style="s2">loose in the world it could be a disease</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.650" end="00:13:10.570" style="s2">you know we have depleted the the power</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.590" end="00:13:13.330" style="s2">of many of our antibiotics there could</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.570" end="00:13:17.230" style="s2">be a plague that takes loose and</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.360" end="00:15:30.290" style="s2">talked about the 5th attractor and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.370" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">we need to find another stable system</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.930" end="00:16:04.820" style="s2">teaching in complexity what are the key</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.220" end="00:16:15.730" style="s2">key part and again why I had panda Bank</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.520" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">on my list of possible causes is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.730" end="00:16:22.020" style="s2">concept of fat tails in fact you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:25.000" style="s2">the concept I&#39;ve written historically</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.020" end="00:16:26.980" style="s2">skeptical the concept of wisdom and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.000" end="00:16:27.820" style="s2">wisdom teachings and all that whoo horse</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.980" end="00:16:30.520" style="s2">shit right</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.820" end="00:16:32.440" style="s2">however I&#39;ve now concluded that in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.520" end="00:16:34.440" style="s2">modern world there is something called</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.440" end="00:16:37.540" style="s2">wisdom and it consists of two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.440" end="00:16:40.180" style="s2">first and above all else understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.540" end="00:16:42.430" style="s2">the concept of fat tails and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.180" end="00:16:45.610" style="s2">something that comes up again and again</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.430" end="00:16:47.410" style="s2">and again in complex systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.610" end="00:16:51.700" style="s2">particularly about social systems which</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.410" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">is that unlike what seems like unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.700" end="00:16:57.640" style="s2">events are not that unlikely for</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:59.050" style="s2">instance the financial crisis of 2008 my</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.640" end="00:17:01.120" style="s2">blood would just boil when these</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.050" end="00:17:03.360" style="s2">financial executives would go on and say</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:05.800" style="s2">oh this was a one in a million year</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.360" end="00:17:08.800" style="s2">event how could we possibly a plan for</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.800" end="00:17:11.230" style="s2">it wrong dude if you understand power</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.800" end="00:17:13.329" style="s2">law distributions which is a specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.230" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">mathematical kind of curve which an</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.329" end="00:17:17.980" style="s2">astounding number of social systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:20.050" style="s2">approximate no one should be careful</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.980" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">that didn&#39;t say it&#39;s not exactly a power</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.050" end="00:17:23.650" style="s2">law but it&#39;s like it which means that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:26.949" style="s2">the the right side of the curve the bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.650" end="00:17:30.280" style="s2">events happened way more often than a</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.949" end="00:17:32.650" style="s2">Gaussian distribution and if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.280" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">the pandemics over the last 20 years we</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.650" end="00:17:38.380" style="s2">had two already three we had SARS we had</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.179" style="s2">MERS and we had a bola</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.380" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">right probably a bunch of other ones I</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.179" end="00:17:44.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t even track and if you plot those</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:47.110" style="s2">on a curve how many cases how many</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.740" end="00:17:50.290" style="s2">fatalities there on the left part of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.110" end="00:17:53.350" style="s2">power law distribution but they&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.290" end="00:17:55.480" style="s2">more happening much more rapidly than a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.350" end="00:17:58.120" style="s2">Gaussian or random distribution would</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.480" end="00:18:00.270" style="s2">tell you and so he all it takes is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.120" end="00:18:02.740" style="s2">think in power laws and you will know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.270" end="00:18:05.020" style="s2">that at the rate at which these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.740" end="00:18:07.690" style="s2">are popping up a worse one will happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.020" end="00:18:09.580" style="s2">and oh by the way this is by far not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.690" end="00:18:11.530" style="s2">worst one that&#39;s possible we&#39;re not way</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.580" end="00:18:13.420" style="s2">out on the right tail</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.530" end="00:18:15.490" style="s2">we&#39;re probably you know I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.420" end="00:18:17.140" style="s2">guess here and so don&#39;t hold me the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.490" end="00:18:19.710" style="s2">mathematical rigor on this we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.140" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">probably at about a 1 in 30 or 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.710" end="00:18:23.940" style="s2">probability on the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:28.050" style="s2">side of the distribution considering the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.940" end="00:18:30.970" style="s2">contagiousness of this one which is high</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.050" end="00:18:32.890" style="s2">but not super high it&#39;s about a third of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.970" end="00:18:36.790" style="s2">measles for instance measles is three</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.890" end="00:18:38.650" style="s2">times as contagious it&#39;s got a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.790" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">high kill rate fatality rate on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.650" end="00:18:41.950" style="s2">order of one to two percent pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:44.800" style="s2">for these kinds of things but it could</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.950" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">be higher SARS was six or seven percent</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.800" end="00:18:51.310" style="s2">MERS was like fifteen or twenty percent</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:53.260" style="s2">right something like smallpox is the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.310" end="00:18:55.270" style="s2">real scary one which is more contagious</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.260" end="00:18:57.850" style="s2">than this it kills 50 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.270" end="00:19:00.700" style="s2">people so this is on the right tail on</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.850" end="00:19:02.140" style="s2">the right side of the distribution but</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.700" end="00:19:04.420" style="s2">not way out there so this was</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.140" end="00:19:06.370" style="s2">predictable in a few if you would</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.420" end="00:19:10.510" style="s2">specify the statistical nature of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.370" end="00:19:11.620" style="s2">epidemic in October when we chatted and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.510" end="00:19:12.580" style="s2">said what do you think Jeff what do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.620" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">chances are something like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.580" end="00:19:16.090" style="s2">happening I&#39;ve said fuck yeah it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:17.740" style="s2">definitely happen and probably in my</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.990" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">or thereabout so yeah so that&#39;s where if</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.830" end="00:19:30.340" style="s2">one thinks in power laws and and fat</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">tails one is at the first step of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.340" end="00:19:35.140" style="s2">and the second specifically the</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.860" end="00:20:22.560" style="s2">the worlds of complexity research</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.350" end="00:20:25.000" style="s2">cognitive science and cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.560" end="00:20:26.560" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of made a name for himself as</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.000" end="00:20:29.560" style="s2">something of a collapse ologist</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.560" end="00:20:32.020" style="s2">if such word exists and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.560" end="00:20:34.420" style="s2">talking about this stuff for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.020" end="00:20:35.260" style="s2">been looking at it for a long time what</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.420" end="00:20:37.960" style="s2">is your sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.260" end="00:20:39.550" style="s2">now how do you feel the sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.960" end="00:20:43.450" style="s2">shift in terms of people taking this</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.550" end="00:20:45.090" style="s2">seriously now in the wake of this and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:48.790" style="s2">sort of as we start to project out</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.090" end="00:20:51.090" style="s2">further forward one thing that I see is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.790" end="00:20:53.920" style="s2">that more people are recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.090" end="00:20:56.470" style="s2">interdependencies or what Fritjof Capra</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.920" end="00:20:58.390" style="s2">calls the state of interbeing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.470" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">recognition that my existence depends on</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.390" end="00:21:02.500" style="s2">the existence of others and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:04.510" style="s2">really potent when you might go outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.500" end="00:21:07.090" style="s2">and get sick or make someone sick</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.510" end="00:21:08.560" style="s2">so this feeling I don&#39;t care if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.090" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">have the name for it people are getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.560" end="00:21:15.640" style="s2">it and so one thing I see is that people</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:16.870" style="s2">are feeling that and they&#39;re slowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.640" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">down when most of them have not</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.870" end="00:21:21.310" style="s2">practiced slowing down now those of us</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:25.390" style="s2">who already made changes in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.310" end="00:21:27.340" style="s2">before this we&#39;re thriving in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.390" end="00:21:30.190" style="s2">most of our friends are now recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.340" end="00:21:32.830" style="s2">that we made good choices so like my</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.190" end="00:21:34.630" style="s2">friends at see me making smoothies with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.830" end="00:21:35.800" style="s2">fresh vegetables because I moved to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.630" end="00:21:38.560" style="s2">place where there&#39;s a campus you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.800" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">culture and then the tropics and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.560" end="00:21:42.310" style="s2">actually a food web of support they see</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:43.330" style="s2">that I&#39;m getting healthy food and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.310" end="00:21:46.030" style="s2">don&#39;t have to go to the grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.330" end="00:21:48.580" style="s2">they&#39;re like maybe Joe understands it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.030" end="00:21:50.820" style="s2">and I think a lot of us have someone in</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.580" end="00:21:54.160" style="s2">our networks who did something like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.820" end="00:21:57.120" style="s2">so one thing that I see is a relaxing of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.160" end="00:21:59.470" style="s2">the rigidity a humility of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:02.410" style="s2">for people who realize that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.470" end="00:22:04.690" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know what to do they also</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.410" end="00:22:07.720" style="s2">are realizing no one is telling them to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.690" end="00:22:11.320" style="s2">make a decision and so they&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.720" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">place where they can introspect and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.320" end="00:22:18.670" style="s2">very hopeful about that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.690" style="s2">could with the right nudging with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.670" end="00:22:22.090" style="s2">right supports with the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.690" end="00:22:26.050" style="s2">conversations a true transformation is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.090" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">possible I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely I get</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.050" end="00:22:29.500" style="s2">less than 50 percent I&#39;d even say less</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:32.680" style="s2">than 10 percent likely we would achieve</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.500" end="00:22:35.260" style="s2">a transformation in this moment in these</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.680" end="00:22:38.230" style="s2">few months but in some places it will</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.260" end="00:22:41.980" style="s2">happen because of this opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.230" end="00:22:44.410" style="s2">so everyone that is in a place of trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.980" end="00:22:46.030" style="s2">to create the changes try to help your</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.410" end="00:22:47.980" style="s2">friends understand better how they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.030" end="00:22:49.090" style="s2">make the changes and everyone is in</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.980" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">these moments of pause and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.090" end="00:22:54.340" style="s2">eugen use this as an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:57.790" style="s2">educate yourself some more about how you</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.340" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">might live differently and don&#39;t let me</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.790" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">tell you a damn thing about how to live</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">differently if at the time as jordan</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:05.500" style="s2">green hall has said this is time for</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:08.830" style="s2">sovereignty make your own damn decisions</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.500" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">and maybe for once in your life make</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.830" end="00:23:12.430" style="s2">your own damn decisions because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:15.190" style="s2">been told what to do by our employers</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.430" end="00:23:17.920" style="s2">and by our customers for so long we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.190" end="00:23:21.160" style="s2">this opportunity and so that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.920" end="00:23:23.980" style="s2">think um yes pandemic as ever as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.160" end="00:23:27.910" style="s2">blessing and decide and disguise if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.980" end="00:23:31.150" style="s2">will receive the gift and why do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.910" end="00:23:33.490" style="s2">think so few of us saw this coming or at</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.150" end="00:23:35.410" style="s2">least certainly the institutions and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.490" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">policymakers and the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.410" end="00:23:39.160" style="s2">supposed to be in charge I was supposed</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:40.440" style="s2">to be seeing these things coming didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.160" end="00:23:43.270" style="s2">see it coming why do you think that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.440" end="00:23:45.880" style="s2">well as a basic idea in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.270" end="00:23:49.510" style="s2">science called situated cognition which</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.880" end="00:23:51.940" style="s2">is that you are able to think and act in</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.510" end="00:23:55.390" style="s2">the world because you have a semantic</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.940" end="00:23:57.010" style="s2">structure that extends into the world so</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.390" end="00:23:58.810" style="s2">right now you and I are interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.010" end="00:24:00.970" style="s2">a screen as though it&#39;s real and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.810" end="00:24:03.700" style="s2">it situated in this face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.970" end="00:24:05.830" style="s2">dialogue with all with a huge global</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.700" end="00:24:09.430" style="s2">infrastructure enabling it and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.830" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">situation structures are thinking so</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.430" end="00:24:14.130" style="s2">what&#39;s happened is a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:17.530" style="s2">in entrenched developmental pathways</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.130" end="00:24:19.390" style="s2">where the development is constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.530" end="00:24:22.030" style="s2">what the situation allows them to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.390" end="00:24:24.250" style="s2">the feedbacks that are semantically</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.030" end="00:24:27.130" style="s2">available or the incentive structures</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.250" end="00:24:28.690" style="s2">that are semantically available and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.130" end="00:24:30.760" style="s2">lot of them were constructive in ways</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.690" end="00:24:33.100" style="s2">where there are levels of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.760" end="00:24:35.050" style="s2">near levels of feedbacks that became</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.100" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">disconnected or or just never connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.050" end="00:24:40.570" style="s2">in the first place so there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:42.340" style="s2">obfuscation that&#39;s present the way that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.570" end="00:24:45.580" style="s2">I like to call this is there&#39;s a horizon</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:48.790" style="s2">of ignorance complex systems have</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.580" end="00:24:50.650" style="s2">obscurity in their very nature things</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.790" end="00:24:52.990" style="s2">that are happening within a time frame</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.650" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">over here that happen another time frame</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.990" end="00:24:57.340" style="s2">over here it&#39;s the time to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:59.620" style="s2">the information is not in sync it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.340" end="00:25:03.030" style="s2">obscure the system cannot see each part</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.620" end="00:25:05.550" style="s2">and this is why the fragment</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.030" end="00:25:08.820" style="s2">the reductionism the non holistic way</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.550" end="00:25:11.040" style="s2">that our information Ecology&#39;s have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.820" end="00:25:15.510" style="s2">built up historically make all of those</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.040" end="00:25:17.400" style="s2">institutions blind and I know Daniel</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.400" end="00:25:21.510" style="s2">this so I won&#39;t say anymore except go</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.070" end="00:25:24.990" style="s2">watch the interview on the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.510" end="00:25:27.420" style="s2">sense-making but um but that is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.990" end="00:25:29.280" style="s2">reality is the inability to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.420" end="00:25:30.920" style="s2">collective intelligence is why those</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.280" end="00:25:33.090" style="s2">institutions are failing so miserably</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.920" end="00:25:34.830" style="s2">and this is why we also have this great</p>

<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:42.840" style="s2">to create collective intelligence we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.130" end="00:25:45.660" style="s2">actually create sense making systems</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.660" end="00:25:49.230" style="s2">encumbered by the limits of those other</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.460" end="00:25:50.820" style="s2">institutions because they&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:52.620" style="s2">working right there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.820" end="00:25:56.310" style="s2">people in the systems world who for</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.620" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">decades have been calling for change but</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.310" end="00:26:03.540" style="s2">it&#39;s been a it&#39;s been boomeranging you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:06.150" style="s2">know the call for change seems to come</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.540" end="00:26:10.650" style="s2">back every time we send it out it kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.150" end="00:26:16.160" style="s2">of comes back and and that has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.650" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">because because there were so many</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.160" end="00:26:23.640" style="s2">contexts coming together to form this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">the the patterns that we&#39;ve been stuck</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.640" end="00:26:29.660" style="s2">in so if you think about it the</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.790" end="00:26:47.370" style="s2">and then the health system has been a</p>

<p begin="00:27:09.000" end="00:27:12.690" style="s2">okay if there was also this other place</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.430" end="00:27:15.260" style="s2">where they put the whole thing back</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.690" end="00:27:15.260" style="s2">together again</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.330" end="00:27:19.590" style="s2">but where is the health you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:23.700" style="s2">think right now we&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.590" end="00:27:28.499" style="s2">that some of these distinctions that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.700" end="00:27:32.369" style="s2">were made between but why would a virus</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.499" end="00:27:35.509" style="s2">affect the education system why would a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.369" end="00:27:38.279" style="s2">virus stop the economic system that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.509" end="00:27:41.129" style="s2">should be something that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.279" end="00:27:44.129" style="s2">stay in your lane virus you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.129" end="00:27:50.730" style="s2">to be a health issue not an economic</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.129" end="00:27:53.460" style="s2">issue or a cultural issue or e is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.730" end="00:27:57.629" style="s2">is this one of those moments where</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.460" end="00:27:59.879" style="s2">actually the capacity that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.629" end="00:28:02.489" style="s2">collectively hold for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.879" end="00:28:05.220" style="s2">their world changes is this one of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.489" end="00:28:07.649" style="s2">moments like are we at that one of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.220" end="00:28:09.299" style="s2">junctions because this is a direct sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.649" end="00:28:10.710" style="s2">of embodied experience of having to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.299" end="00:28:16.230" style="s2">connect with all our systems all you</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.710" end="00:28:19.320" style="s2">mean yeah it&#39;s a directive however</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.230" end="00:28:22.470" style="s2">embodied it is though it&#39;s entirely</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.320" end="00:28:25.109" style="s2">possible not to see it though I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.470" end="00:28:29.009" style="s2">want to jump ahead and say everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.109" end="00:28:33.779" style="s2">see the interdependency now because I</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.009" end="00:28:36.299" style="s2">think that would be naive is there the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.779" end="00:28:38.220" style="s2">possibility that people could perceive</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.299" end="00:28:43.470" style="s2">interdependence II now in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.220" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">they haven&#39;t yes absolutely and I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.470" end="00:28:48.690" style="s2">add to that particularly the people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:52.679" style="s2">have been most betrayed by the existing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.690" end="00:28:55.499" style="s2">system so if the ones I think that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.679" end="00:28:58.019" style="s2">in the the greatest danger of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.499" end="00:29:00.210" style="s2">perpetuating old patterns are the people</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.019" end="00:29:03.299" style="s2">who have profited from it we&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.210" end="00:29:07.759" style="s2">moment where there is a loosening of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.299" end="00:29:10.950" style="s2">threads of old system patterns but</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.759" end="00:29:13.470" style="s2">believe they want to tighten up they</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.950" end="00:29:17.850" style="s2">want there is a call to return to</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.470" end="00:29:22.289" style="s2">normalcy that is so strong it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.850" end="00:29:25.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like wanting working with people</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.289" end="00:29:28.400" style="s2">who are dealing with addiction and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.230" end="00:29:31.540" style="s2">know that what it is that is known</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.400" end="00:29:35.690" style="s2">is the state of being in that addictive</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.540" end="00:29:38.330" style="s2">relationship and so this unknown state</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.690" end="00:29:41.330" style="s2">is is not what anyone wants we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.330" end="00:29:44.120" style="s2">know how how do you survive in a world</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.330" end="00:29:46.910" style="s2">with a broken economy how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.120" end="00:29:51.190" style="s2">you teach your kids who are you actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.910" end="00:29:54.290" style="s2">if these institutions and structures</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.190" end="00:29:57.560" style="s2">that your identity has been formed</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.290" end="00:29:59.420" style="s2">within right you are your education</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.560" end="00:30:03.070" style="s2">system you are your culture you are your</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.940" end="00:30:24.650" style="s2">have those things if the world is</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.220" end="00:30:33.870" style="s2">different in six months who-who are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.650" end="00:30:38.190" style="s2">so it&#39;s scary and I think that the that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.870" end="00:30:41.220" style="s2">it would be I think it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.190" end="00:30:43.230" style="s2">beautiful thing to have the people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.220" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">have been working in systems and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.230" end="00:30:50.460" style="s2">complexity for the last several decades</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:52.770" style="s2">to actually come together now because</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.460" end="00:30:56.010" style="s2">this this is a really important moment</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.770" end="00:30:58.620" style="s2">and the systems were broken anyway</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.010" end="00:31:01.080" style="s2">they&#39;ve been broken why go back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.620" end="00:31:03.470" style="s2">normal when you know I&#39;ve seen this meme</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.080" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">everywhere when normals what got us here</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.470" end="00:31:12.900" style="s2">normal was broken and that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:15.030" style="s2">ended up here so so what can what can</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.900" end="00:31:23.700" style="s2">this community of systems thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.030" end="00:31:28.200" style="s2">actually bring that will help help</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.700" end="00:31:32.130" style="s2">perception of that interdependence II be</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.200" end="00:31:34.500" style="s2">a new normal so Nora also used the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.130" end="00:31:36.179" style="s2">analogy of addiction which Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.500" end="00:31:38.910" style="s2">did recently as well and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.179" end="00:31:42.030" style="s2">really powerful way of looking at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.910" end="00:31:43.830" style="s2">going on that as a society if anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.030" end="00:31:45.780" style="s2">up to be dealt with someone in it tried</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.830" end="00:31:47.250" style="s2">to help an addict they&#39;ll know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.780" end="00:31:51.300" style="s2">actually one of the big issues is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.250" end="00:31:54.090" style="s2">delusion its delusion walked thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.300" end="00:31:55.950" style="s2">and what we&#39;re going through now is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.090" end="00:31:57.630" style="s2">kind of like as a society I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.950" end="00:32:00.210" style="s2">been deluded for a long time and like</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.630" end="00:32:02.100" style="s2">reality has really started to hit and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.210" end="00:32:04.200" style="s2">this is something I think yeah I really</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.100" end="00:32:06.750" style="s2">find that a useful metaphor yeah same I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.200" end="00:32:08.400" style="s2">think the addiction analogy is really</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.750" end="00:32:12.179" style="s2">rich there&#39;s so much to it I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.400" end="00:32:13.559" style="s2">another aspect of it is that really big</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.179" end="00:32:15.210" style="s2">in the dynamics of addiction at least in</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.559" end="00:32:17.340" style="s2">the twelve steps program is is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.210" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">dynamic of control what do we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.340" end="00:32:20.429" style="s2">control over and what don&#39;t we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:23.070" style="s2">control over and the whole point of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.429" end="00:32:24.270" style="s2">addictive cycle and and having an</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.070" end="00:32:25.770" style="s2">addiction is that you don&#39;t have control</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.270" end="00:32:28.710" style="s2">over your behaviors even if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.770" end="00:32:31.140" style="s2">stop and our society you know was you</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.710" end="00:32:33.179" style="s2">know through you know you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.140" end="00:32:34.730" style="s2">delusion through momentum you know many</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.179" end="00:32:37.080" style="s2">many other factors just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.730" end="00:32:38.140" style="s2">rampaging forward in an unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.080" end="00:32:41.160" style="s2">way and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.140" end="00:32:43.930" style="s2">fascinating to me is this this hard stop</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.160" end="00:32:46.210" style="s2">it reminds me of rock bottom in</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.930" end="00:32:47.710" style="s2">addiction and now I&#39;ve spoken to a few</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.210" end="00:32:49.390" style="s2">people about this specifically and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.710" end="00:32:51.640" style="s2">think the jury is still out on whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.390" end="00:32:53.590" style="s2">this is rock bottom for society or</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.640" end="00:32:55.090" style="s2">whether it&#39;s gonna take something even</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.590" end="00:32:56.500" style="s2">more extreme to really hit that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.090" end="00:32:58.990" style="s2">that&#39;s often a question in addiction</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.500" end="00:33:00.370" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you know if you are with</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.990" end="00:33:02.260" style="s2">someone going through that process it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.370" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">a question of oh I really I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.260" end="00:33:04.810" style="s2">desperately hope this is rock bottom for</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.760" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">them so that they can really have that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.810" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">that process and I hope that for our</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:13.000" style="s2">current society and system but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:14.350" style="s2">remains to be seen this is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.000" end="00:33:16.450" style="s2">opportunity for those of us trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.350" end="00:33:18.460" style="s2">create the new economy but it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.450" end="00:33:21.460" style="s2">a big shock to those who don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.460" end="00:33:24.210" style="s2">economy shift so I think there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.460" end="00:33:28.870" style="s2">of aspects to this kind of flow this</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.210" end="00:33:33.100" style="s2">reallocation of flow that none of us are</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.870" end="00:33:35.560" style="s2">really prepared for except I&#39;ll make an</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.100" end="00:33:37.690" style="s2">exception to that except those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.560" end="00:33:39.460" style="s2">are learning how to do improv with</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.690" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">higher levels of human capacity which I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.460" end="00:33:44.020" style="s2">know you&#39;ve talked a lot about a lot on</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:46.210" style="s2">repre wisdom how to develop those human</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.020" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">capacities for dealing with uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.210" end="00:33:50.740" style="s2">for managing complexity for holding</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:53.380" style="s2">different perspectives for improvising</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.740" end="00:33:55.420" style="s2">in the moment for discerning reality all</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.380" end="00:33:57.190" style="s2">of those skills are more important now</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.420" end="00:34:00.010" style="s2">than ever but they&#39;re actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.190" end="00:34:02.710" style="s2">shift what the economy actually is in</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.010" end="00:34:04.930" style="s2">the next weeks and the next months and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.710" end="00:34:08.620" style="s2">in the next years which is a collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.930" end="00:34:11.169" style="s2">the old economy at least in part how</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.620" end="00:34:12.490" style="s2">confident are you this I mean did you</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.169" end="00:34:13.870" style="s2">want to explain more about that you see</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.490" end="00:34:15.610" style="s2">that the collapse but when you say the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.870" end="00:34:17.409" style="s2">collapse of the economy most people will</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.610" end="00:34:20.409" style="s2">sort of assume that&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.409" end="00:34:22.540" style="s2">end-of-the-world scenario well one thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.409" end="00:34:24.730" style="s2">I would say is there was already an</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.540" end="00:34:26.140" style="s2">end-of-the-world but most of us don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.730" end="00:34:29.080" style="s2">remember it because it happened on</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.140" end="00:34:31.270" style="s2">longer timescales so when we went from</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.080" end="00:34:33.100" style="s2">living in hunter-gatherer societies to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.270" end="00:34:36.730" style="s2">eventually the majority of humans living</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.760" end="00:36:16.579" style="s2">what&#39;s different about the collapse is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.030" end="00:36:18.559" style="s2">firstly it&#39;s a an interdependent of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.579" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">lot of collapses which makes it harder</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.559" end="00:36:26.630" style="s2">to see but also we are in a process of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:30.140" style="s2">creating a mass extinction event you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.630" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">know very very few people in ecology so</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.140" end="00:36:35.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">you take a complex food web and start</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.240" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">collapsing its web of connections so</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:43.130" style="s2">instead of there being 12 layers of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:46.069" style="s2">relationships between species it</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.130" end="00:36:48.890" style="s2">collapses to four crates for agility</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.069" end="00:36:50.569" style="s2">across the whole system there when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.890" end="00:36:54.319" style="s2">system collapses it takes down more</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.569" end="00:36:56.780" style="s2">species humans are entangled in so many</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.319" end="00:36:58.690" style="s2">food webs that attack has it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.780" end="00:37:01.650" style="s2">quickly into into</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.690" end="00:37:04.180" style="s2">it will cause us to go extinct with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.650" end="00:37:05.830" style="s2">and so aren&#39;t enough people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.180" end="00:37:08.620" style="s2">understand ecology do you know how this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.830" end="00:37:10.750" style="s2">works to see that this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.620" end="00:37:16.420" style="s2">possibility for our species in the next</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.750" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">50 to 100 years so our challenge is sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.420" end="00:37:22.740" style="s2">of a spiritual or semantic challenge how</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:25.690" style="s2">can we let go of our habits of normalcy</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.740" end="00:37:30.280" style="s2">to practice discerning what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.690" end="00:37:32.260" style="s2">real - then co-create the patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.280" end="00:37:34.780" style="s2">give us the best chance of the future</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.260" end="00:37:37.030" style="s2">that makes the planet livable for our</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.780" end="00:37:38.470" style="s2">children and grandchildren this is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.030" end="00:37:42.520" style="s2">the sustainability folks have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.470" end="00:37:44.710" style="s2">saying for 50 years but it&#39;s most robust</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.520" end="00:37:47.400" style="s2">articulations come out of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.710" end="00:37:49.690" style="s2">science like mathematical biology</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:51.700" style="s2">complex systems research pattern</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.690" end="00:37:55.030" style="s2">formation phase transitions these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.700" end="00:37:58.600" style="s2">from complexity science but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.030" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">same lesson so for the people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.600" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">know that the economy is dying or</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:05.890" style="s2">already dead but they need to practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:07.480" style="s2">is a little bit of Improv Theater to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.890" end="00:38:09.640" style="s2">practice putting themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.480" end="00:38:12.040" style="s2">different social realities to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.640" end="00:38:13.720" style="s2">to discern within it and also practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.040" end="00:38:16.990" style="s2">cooperating because that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.720" end="00:38:18.280" style="s2">going to need to do moving forward and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.990" end="00:38:19.600" style="s2">lot of people aren&#39;t going to get this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.280" end="00:38:21.490" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.600" end="00:38:22.660" style="s2">disoriented and confused is there</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.490" end="00:38:25.330" style="s2">anything else that&#39;s really burning</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.660" end="00:38:30.010" style="s2">right now the thing that&#39;s burning right</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.330" end="00:38:33.010" style="s2">now is the fierce urgency of now we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.010" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">this opportunity and if you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.010" end="00:38:37.600" style="s2">people who play military games and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:40.600" style="s2">corporate takeover strategies and even</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.600" end="00:38:42.130" style="s2">the sociopathic people who do and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.600" end="00:38:43.840" style="s2">only clan called the Shock Doctrine of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.130" end="00:38:46.020" style="s2">grabbing resources when everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.840" end="00:38:48.490" style="s2">confused they don&#39;t waste an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.020" end="00:38:50.590" style="s2">now those of us who care about life in</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.490" end="00:38:53.110" style="s2">the future of the planet we waste a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.590" end="00:38:55.210" style="s2">of opportunities and what I would or</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.110" end="00:38:58.300" style="s2">just to do is to not waste this one and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.210" end="00:39:00.610" style="s2">if you personally waste this one don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.300" end="00:39:04.810" style="s2">reach the next one so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.610" end="00:39:06.370" style="s2">what I would say because these systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.810" end="00:39:09.340" style="s2">and these patterns are intensifying</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.370" end="00:39:10.990" style="s2">they&#39;re not easing up so whatever harms</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.340" end="00:39:12.020" style="s2">are being done now we&#39;re setting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.990" end="00:39:14.630" style="s2">stage for large</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.020" end="00:39:17.990" style="s2">arms in the future simply by the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.630" end="00:39:19.580" style="s2">of continuing and so I&#39;m as</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.990" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">uncomfortable as it may be to let</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.580" end="00:39:23.330" style="s2">ourselves feel awkward and confused</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:24.820" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we need to do to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.330" end="00:39:28.130" style="s2">learn new skills and to live differently</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.820" end="00:39:30.290" style="s2">um and that&#39;s where this opportunity is</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.130" end="00:39:32.750" style="s2">that we need to grab so I hope more</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.290" end="00:39:35.990" style="s2">people do it yeah you talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.750" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">drive back to the status quo and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.990" end="00:39:40.580" style="s2">gonna be very very powerful actors on</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:43.010" style="s2">that side trying to kind of patch up the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.580" end="00:39:46.040" style="s2">existing system we&#39;re talking probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.010" end="00:39:50.090" style="s2">like mass government bailouts probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.040" end="00:39:51.710" style="s2">dwarfing kind of the 2008 system so with</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.090" end="00:39:55.430" style="s2">those really powerful actors on that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.710" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">side what is the alternative to the new</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.430" end="00:39:59.000" style="s2">normal but you&#39;re saying that it would</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:01.880" style="s2">be great if the complexity thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.000" end="00:40:04.370" style="s2">the systems change people were involved</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.880" end="00:40:08.170" style="s2">what what does that look like what does</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.370" end="00:40:08.170" style="s2">a different system look like</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.230" end="00:40:17.930" style="s2">I think that the better question is what</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.119" end="00:40:23.060" style="s2">does it feel like what happened what</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.930" end="00:40:25.820" style="s2">does it how does it think because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.060" end="00:40:29.540" style="s2">what does it look like is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.820" end="00:40:33.350" style="s2">consequence of a whole lot of details</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.540" end="00:40:35.750" style="s2">that get shifted from though the way it</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.350" end="00:40:40.970" style="s2">feels or the way this that that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.750" end="00:40:44.570" style="s2">that the underlying premises so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.970" end="00:40:47.510" style="s2">in a rush to map out a vision of new</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.570" end="00:40:51.050" style="s2">system I think that there&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.510" end="00:40:58.340" style="s2">problems with doing that if you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.050" end="00:41:00.290" style="s2">about the way soil works you know and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.340" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">you think about the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.290" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">the way so well is this combination of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:10.670" style="s2">relationships between bacteria between</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:14.410" style="s2">nutrients between organisms between all</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.670" end="00:41:18.050" style="s2">sorts of things happening that allow</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.410" end="00:41:20.750" style="s2">other relationships to occur and those</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.050" end="00:41:25.700" style="s2">relationships allow other relationships</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.750" end="00:41:31.420" style="s2">to occur so somehow you get from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.700" end="00:41:35.000" style="s2">soil to that person could be you or me</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.420" end="00:41:40.670" style="s2">walking through the forest having an</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.000" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">idea okay so right now our trajectories</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.670" end="00:41:52.760" style="s2">of causation and strategic planning and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:55.910" style="s2">envisioning don&#39;t work like that so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.760" end="00:41:58.340" style="s2">that is where for me the most important</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.910" end="00:42:00.890" style="s2">thing is this immediate notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.340" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">soil what relationships can be made</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.890" end="00:42:05.330" style="s2">right now that be will be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:07.220" style="s2">relationships that build more</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.330" end="00:42:10.850" style="s2">relationships that lead to other</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.220" end="00:42:15.320" style="s2">relationships that move across lots of</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.500" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">metaphor right you&#39;ve got um you&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.210" end="00:45:58.700" style="s2">out very differently for instance one of</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.410" end="00:46:15.109" style="s2">probably if it wasn&#39;t for corrupt lying</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.170" end="00:46:17.749" style="s2">in China in the Wuhan province there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.109" end="00:46:20.089" style="s2">a big political set of meetings that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.749" end="00:46:22.970" style="s2">were coming up in a couple of weeks and</p>

<p begin="00:46:25.220" end="00:46:31.579" style="s2">peers led people in the Wuhan province</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.829" end="00:46:33.319" style="s2">to cover up the the extent of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.579" end="00:46:36.019" style="s2">for several weeks when it could have</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.319" end="00:46:39.559" style="s2">been nipped in the bud and so radical</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.019" end="00:46:41.569" style="s2">transparency could have prevented that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.559" end="00:46:44.599" style="s2">let&#39;s also look at the bad responses</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.569" end="00:46:46.279" style="s2">across the West right nobody in the West</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.599" end="00:46:46.910" style="s2">gets a gold star nobody even gets a</p>
