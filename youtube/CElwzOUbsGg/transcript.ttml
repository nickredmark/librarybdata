<p begin="00:02:33.980" end="00:02:38.660" style="s2">to begin I&#39;m interested to know more</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.500" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">about you what were the conditions under</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.660" end="00:02:42.530" style="s2">which you developed your mind as a young</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:42.890" style="s2">person and how do you continue to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.530" end="00:02:45.290" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.890" end="00:02:47.900" style="s2">even today fun question I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.290" end="00:02:51.170" style="s2">the key defining things for me was I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.900" end="00:02:54.140" style="s2">home-schooled throughout most of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.170" end="00:02:57.290" style="s2">childhood and the reason for it was my</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.140" end="00:03:00.260" style="s2">parents were educational philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.290" end="00:03:02.510" style="s2">theorists and they had the idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.260" end="00:03:04.459" style="s2">kids were given pretty much no</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.510" end="00:03:07.130" style="s2">curriculum but exposed to as many things</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.459" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">as possible and then their interests</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.130" end="00:03:11.569" style="s2">were facilitated that they would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:13.970" style="s2">blossom in the unique way that they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.569" end="00:03:17.359" style="s2">most innately suited to and so it was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.970" end="00:03:19.970" style="s2">educational theory experiment and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.359" end="00:03:22.190" style="s2">had no curriculum at all never did hand</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.970" end="00:03:23.510" style="s2">writing spelling state capitals and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.190" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">happens to be those three are good</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.510" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">examples of things that I never learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:29.480" style="s2">well spell-checking later taught me how</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.430" style="s2">to spell and make the fact that my</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.480" end="00:03:34.430" style="s2">handwriting is illegible tolerable okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.430" end="00:03:37.130" style="s2">and don&#39;t have state capitals but I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:38.780" style="s2">fascinated by all of the sciences I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.130" end="00:03:41.600" style="s2">fascinated by all the philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.780" end="00:03:43.880" style="s2">disciplines and so I got to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.600" end="00:03:46.430" style="s2">working in understanding modern physics</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.880" end="00:03:48.739" style="s2">as a little bitty kid and eastern and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.430" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">western schools of philosophy and etc</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.739" end="00:03:53.720" style="s2">and one of the other cool things was not</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:55.130" style="s2">having subject divisions I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.720" end="00:03:57.470" style="s2">there were subject divisions so there</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.130" end="00:03:58.850" style="s2">was no arbitrary break between physics</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.470" end="00:04:01.850" style="s2">and chemistry or chemistry and biology</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.850" end="00:04:03.350" style="s2">or any of the disciplines so we&#39;d be as</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.850" end="00:04:06.410" style="s2">a little kid it asked a question like</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.350" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">why is the sky blue and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.410" end="00:04:10.549" style="s2">answer has to do with the physics of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:11.959" style="s2">diffraction and the molecule size the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.549" end="00:04:14.989" style="s2">upper atmosphere that means you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.959" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">understand Sun and stars and solar</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.989" end="00:04:20.180" style="s2">formation and atmospheric chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:22.640" style="s2">how diffraction works and the physics of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.180" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">light waves and the actual molecules in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.640" end="00:04:25.400" style="s2">the other atmosphere but it also means</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:27.800" style="s2">you have to understand how a retina work</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.400" end="00:04:29.540" style="s2">and what&#39;s objective blue is and what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.800" end="00:04:31.250" style="s2">the difference between subjective blue</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">and object of blue and then the hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.250" end="00:04:34.910" style="s2">problem of neuroscience and like all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">that comes into her the answer that well</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.910" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">mm-hmm almost everything was a movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.330" end="00:04:42.440" style="s2">between various Sciences and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:44.270" style="s2">getting into the deep philosophy the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.440" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2">ground of the sciences or the hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.270" end="00:04:50.120" style="s2">problems were and that led to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">interdisciplinary and system orientation</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.120" end="00:04:54.440" style="s2">to understanding the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:55.910" style="s2">that we live in and of course for me it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.440" end="00:04:58.280" style="s2">was always implicitly because</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.910" end="00:05:00.620" style="s2">understanding early on evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.280" end="00:05:03.830" style="s2">theory universe was going somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.620" end="00:05:06.410" style="s2">it was organizing itself towards more</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.830" end="00:05:08.750" style="s2">orderly complexity and with that more</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.410" end="00:05:11.449" style="s2">complexity new emergent properties with</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.750" end="00:05:14.090" style="s2">more evolved physiologies there were new</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.449" end="00:05:17.270" style="s2">capacities of consciousness and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.090" end="00:05:20.210" style="s2">clear that something like we have a role</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.270" end="00:05:23.419" style="s2">to serve in participating with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.210" end="00:05:26.300" style="s2">evolutionary impulse of universe as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.419" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">one creature here that we know has the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.300" end="00:05:31.610" style="s2">abstraction capacity with our certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:34.010" style="s2">structures of prefrontal cortex to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.610" end="00:05:36.410" style="s2">understand evolution itself right to not</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.010" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">just be a part of the grand design but</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.410" end="00:05:39.110" style="s2">be able to think about the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">the direction of evolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.110" end="00:05:42.830" style="s2">principles of it do we really have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:46.010" style="s2">meaningful capacity to consciously</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.830" end="00:05:47.180" style="s2">participate with it and looked like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.010" end="00:05:49.190" style="s2">evolutionary impulse is evolving</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.180" end="00:05:51.470" style="s2">everything all of universe so my</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.190" end="00:05:52.789" style="s2">interest early was how do I understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.470" end="00:05:54.590" style="s2">universe how do I understand where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.789" end="00:05:56.210" style="s2">going and how to help participate with</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.590" end="00:05:58.460" style="s2">evolution of everything so that also</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.210" end="00:06:00.110" style="s2">looked like activism in terms of how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.460" end="00:06:02.510" style="s2">actually support the evolution of</p>

<p begin="00:06:02.510" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">yeah and one thing I&#39;ll add because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.820" end="00:06:08.150" style="s2">so important for people to know is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">for the most part of the kids ask</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.150" end="00:06:11.599" style="s2">questions that they&#39;re really interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:13.849" style="s2">in like why is the sky blue and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.599" end="00:06:16.280" style="s2">really understand the answer we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.849" end="00:06:18.410" style="s2">facilitate the interests well and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.280" end="00:06:19.820" style="s2">we try to force them to be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.410" end="00:06:22.220" style="s2">or at least do that they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.820" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">not interested in at all and the process</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.220" end="00:06:25.400" style="s2">of forcing them to do uninteresting</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.990" end="00:06:26.810" style="s2">things while not the facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.400" end="00:06:28.550" style="s2">interest is what breaks people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.810" end="00:06:30.740" style="s2">interest in life and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.550" end="00:06:32.180" style="s2">extrinsic ly motivate them with money or</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.740" end="00:06:34.340" style="s2">reward or whatever and otherwise they</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.180" end="00:06:37.969" style="s2">want to chill and watch TV or play video</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:50.060" style="s2">is particularly interesting to me we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.780" end="00:06:52.760" style="s2">seriously considering homeschooling our</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.760" end="00:06:57.710" style="s2">your background is motivating to me and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.700" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">that this is indeed a good course to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.710" end="00:07:01.730" style="s2">pursue I was a solid student growing up</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:03.080" style="s2">but I became a much better student later</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.730" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">when I found myself in learning</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.080" end="00:07:06.260" style="s2">environments where I had more freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:07.730" style="s2">do things like for example spend long</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.260" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">periods of time on a subject versus</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.730" end="00:07:12.320" style="s2">changing my focus every 50 minutes like</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:14.420" style="s2">you do at most schools so for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.320" end="00:07:16.520" style="s2">changing class that frequently was</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.420" end="00:07:18.230" style="s2">really disruptive I&#39;m more of a type of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.520" end="00:07:19.700" style="s2">a learner where I like to go deep I</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.230" end="00:07:21.950" style="s2">built momentum and then I want to stick</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.700" end="00:07:23.930" style="s2">with a subject for a while and then also</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.950" end="00:07:25.730" style="s2">whatever typically has my attention has</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.930" end="00:07:27.170" style="s2">all of it so I would do very well in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.730" end="00:07:28.670" style="s2">some classes and just okay and others</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.170" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">also the more I advanced my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.670" end="00:07:35.390" style="s2">education I had the freedom to learn</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">more about how I learned and if I knew</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.390" end="00:07:39.050" style="s2">some of these things earlier in life my</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:40.430" style="s2">ability to advance my own knowledge with</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.050" end="00:07:42.380" style="s2">the effort I was putting in I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.430" end="00:07:44.150" style="s2">would have been greatly accelerated so</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.380" end="00:07:45.650" style="s2">for my boy Desmond I think about how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.150" end="00:07:47.480" style="s2">create this custom learning experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.650" end="00:07:49.730" style="s2">that adaptively contours to his</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.480" end="00:07:51.710" style="s2">interests a way to always harness that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.730" end="00:07:53.300" style="s2">natural curiosity that we have as</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:55.490" style="s2">children and to empower that love of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.300" end="00:07:57.320" style="s2">learning by all means necessary so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.490" end="00:07:59.150" style="s2">really nice to hear about your</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.320" end="00:08:01.250" style="s2">experience and that you look back on it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.150" end="00:08:04.340" style="s2">with appreciation I think about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.250" end="00:08:06.740" style="s2">technologic unemployment is going to in</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.340" end="00:08:09.140" style="s2">something like 30 percent of all jobs in</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.740" end="00:08:11.480" style="s2">the next 15 years mm-hmm it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.140" end="00:08:13.790" style="s2">start with a lot of labour jobs but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.480" end="00:08:15.980" style="s2">going to move with a eye to a lot of non</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.790" end="00:08:19.220" style="s2">labor jobs when we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.980" end="00:08:20.780" style="s2">history of education if a kid was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.220" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">grow up and take over the family</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.780" end="00:08:23.570" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:25.070" style="s2">or the family work whatever that was so</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.570" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">they had to kind of learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.070" end="00:08:29.530" style="s2">those things from a skill location point</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:31.670" style="s2">of view or then it became more</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.530" end="00:08:34.360" style="s2">infrastructure alized and they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.670" end="00:08:36.530" style="s2">going to just get some job within</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.360" end="00:08:38.120" style="s2">infrastructure within my pre-cana me</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.530" end="00:08:39.650" style="s2">they had to be prepared for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.120" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">workforce the workforce is gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.650" end="00:08:43.820" style="s2">progressively more and more automated by</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">the time that people who are kids now</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.820" end="00:08:46.970" style="s2">will be moving into what we would have</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.140" end="00:08:49.190" style="s2">called the workforce previously mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.970" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">and what will be unique is things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.190" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">are uniquely human and so if there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">things that robot</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.410" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">can learn to do well in AI can learn to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">do well and obviously there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:09:00.630" style="s2">question around strong AI but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:02.190" style="s2">take strong AI off announce the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.630" end="00:09:03.990" style="s2">that are uniquely human are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.190" end="00:09:05.520" style="s2">the only things that really adaptive for</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.990" end="00:09:06.810" style="s2">few minutes to do they also happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.520" end="00:09:08.430" style="s2">the things that are most fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.810" end="00:09:10.020" style="s2">fun and intrinsically rewarding for</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.430" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">humans to do so this has always been a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.020" end="00:09:13.860" style="s2">relevant conversation yeah but it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:17.490" style="s2">living in a way that it never has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.860" end="00:09:19.590" style="s2">right so these are some big global</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.490" end="00:09:20.940" style="s2">issues that we are facing how it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.590" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">going to play out is you have to be told</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.940" end="00:09:25.830" style="s2">but what I&#39;m hearing is that the need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:28.740" style="s2">be able to maximize some of our innate</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.830" end="00:09:30.570" style="s2">human capabilities is of paramount</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.740" end="00:09:32.100" style="s2">importance for the next generation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.570" end="00:09:34.050" style="s2">even for people that are going to go</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.100" end="00:09:35.700" style="s2">through this transition when you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.050" end="00:09:37.590" style="s2">about a cognitive enhancer which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.700" end="00:09:38.490" style="s2">ostensibly at the topic of today you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.590" end="00:09:41.130" style="s2">think about something that might make</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.490" end="00:09:43.170" style="s2">you focus better remember more be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.130" end="00:09:45.210" style="s2">to task switch better but if you remove</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.170" end="00:09:47.550" style="s2">a layer from there and you think this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.210" end="00:09:49.290" style="s2">far more important for overall humanity</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.550" end="00:09:52.290" style="s2">it&#39;s for us to be able to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.290" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">ways to optimize our minds ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.290" end="00:09:57.270" style="s2">interact with this world and to be our</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:59.010" style="s2">very best on a consistent basis so what</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.270" end="00:10:01.850" style="s2">was the first experience that you had</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.010" end="00:10:05.640" style="s2">that motivated you to explore the space</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.850" end="00:10:08.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve been interested in human potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.640" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">development and what the space of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.580" end="00:10:12.660" style="s2">possibility was and enhancement</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:33.320" style="s2">insofar as the topics that I was really</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:35.280" style="s2">committed to for the world required</p>

<p begin="00:10:35.280" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">continuously supporting that was an</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.050" end="00:10:42.540" style="s2">important topic I got more acutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">involved when I actually was diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.540" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">with some kind of mysterious autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:50.220" style="s2">diseases that were very rapid onset and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:52.770" style="s2">it didn&#39;t have adequate cures in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.220" end="00:10:56.520" style="s2">allopathic or the holistic alternative</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.770" end="00:10:59.640" style="s2">worlds and it had a shitty prognosis and</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.640" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">symptomology they also had decreased</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.500" end="00:11:05.820" style="s2">cognitive and would symptomology which</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.940" end="00:11:06.089" style="s2">was the center of abilities that didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.089" end="00:11:09.449" style="s2">you lose and so I knew that if I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.579" end="00:11:11.339" style="s2">going to be able to fix these issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.449" end="00:11:12.809" style="s2">that didn&#39;t have adequate solutions I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.339" end="00:11:13.889" style="s2">was gonna have to figure it out and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.809" end="00:11:15.300" style="s2">knew that was going to take cognate</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.889" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">bandwidth so my first focus</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.300" end="00:11:20.550" style="s2">strategically was used the bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:22.499" style="s2">that I have is on increasing cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.550" end="00:11:24.930" style="s2">bandwidth then use that to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.499" end="00:11:26.309" style="s2">the underlying pathophysiology etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.930" end="00:11:29.100" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and corrected and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.309" end="00:11:31.079" style="s2">get back to work and so that led to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.100" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">very deep dive in the whole topic of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.079" end="00:11:35.639" style="s2">cognitive chemistry and this was Rob&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.639" end="00:11:41.100" style="s2">neurotransmission optimization etc so as</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.459" end="00:11:43.319" style="s2">I was diving deep into that space and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.100" end="00:11:45.569" style="s2">looking at what&#39;s been done well and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.319" end="00:11:47.189" style="s2">we&#39;re there pretty significant polls one</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.569" end="00:11:48.899" style="s2">of the big holes that I&#39;m always wanting</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.189" end="00:11:50.759" style="s2">to look at is the topic of synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.899" end="00:11:52.980" style="s2">where do we have a lot of knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.759" end="00:11:55.470" style="s2">acetylcholine goal or dopamine role or</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.980" end="00:11:57.329" style="s2">glutamate role or neurotrophins role but</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.470" end="00:12:00.120" style="s2">not the complex relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.329" end="00:12:01.829" style="s2">those or even between different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.120" end="00:12:05.730" style="s2">of the regulatory system on any of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.829" end="00:12:08.370" style="s2">and so looking at how do we support many</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.730" end="00:12:10.470" style="s2">complex systems that are self-regulating</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.370" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">to have increased regulatory capacity</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.470" end="00:12:14.429" style="s2">became the deep question for me so</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:16.319" style="s2">synthesis there that led to me doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.429" end="00:12:18.300" style="s2">work on myself where I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.319" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">achieve increased cognitive bandwidth to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.300" end="00:12:21.269" style="s2">beyond what my previous healthy baseline</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:24.870" style="s2">had been even while I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.269" end="00:12:26.699" style="s2">pathophysiology going on and then was</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.870" end="00:12:28.439" style="s2">able to figure out underlying cause what</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.699" end="00:12:30.360" style="s2">was going on for me corrective reverse</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.439" end="00:12:32.970" style="s2">autoimmune antibodies that whole fun</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.360" end="00:12:34.410" style="s2">thing that led to doing that with quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.970" end="00:12:36.209" style="s2">a few other people that had various</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.410" end="00:12:38.339" style="s2">forms of disease that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.209" end="00:12:41.579" style="s2">adequate solution and clinical settings</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.339" end="00:12:44.220" style="s2">and to formalizing a model of how health</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.579" end="00:12:46.170" style="s2">aging illness and reversal of illness</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.220" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">could work there was a complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.170" end="00:12:51.749" style="s2">informed model for medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:54.329" style="s2">well-being and so that really was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.749" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">of things that that would pertain to but</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.329" end="00:12:57.929" style="s2">the psycho neuropharmacology the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:12:59.550" style="s2">cognitive psychological stuff was really</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.929" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">essential because almost everyone who is</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.550" end="00:13:04.230" style="s2">dealing with complex illness has some</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:06.269" style="s2">brain fog cognitive effects and has some</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.230" end="00:13:09.420" style="s2">emotion affected by hearing that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.269" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">got incurable prognosis and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.420" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">have their psyche and their cognition in</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:14.939" style="s2">the right place to do everything that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:17.490" style="s2">takes to get better right so focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.939" end="00:13:19.700" style="s2">that first became a central thing so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.490" end="00:13:22.520" style="s2">would say that&#39;s where I went from</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.700" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">being a area of general interest to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.520" end="00:13:27.290" style="s2">area of central deep-dive mm-hmm yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:29.720" style="s2">what I&#39;m hearing is there was a need</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.290" end="00:13:32.360" style="s2">that arose for you personally that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.720" end="00:13:34.400" style="s2">fostered a deep dive to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.360" end="00:13:36.080" style="s2">overall system with which any possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.400" end="00:13:39.800" style="s2">solution would be working over your</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.080" end="00:13:41.180" style="s2">health aging etc from there then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.800" end="00:13:43.340" style="s2">wanted to understand not only how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.180" end="00:13:46.070" style="s2">might be able to utilize some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.340" end="00:13:48.230" style="s2">exogenous chemical to amplify a process</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.070" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">but rather how can we help make the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.230" end="00:13:53.420" style="s2">entire mind that is doing the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:55.220" style="s2">stronger and better over time it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.420" end="00:13:57.380" style="s2">like that was the goal yes and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.220" end="00:13:59.510" style="s2">you&#39;ve been working to solve that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.380" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">the last thing that you said I think is</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.510" end="00:14:04.100" style="s2">absolutely central to what our goal as</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:06.350" style="s2">an organization is is that when we think</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.100" end="00:14:09.020" style="s2">of psychopharmacology as a field or</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.350" end="00:14:10.820" style="s2">really just pharmacology as a field</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.020" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">there are exceptions and they don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.820" end="00:14:15.530" style="s2">to over generalize but generally there</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.690" style="s2">is less focus on fundamental or</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.530" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">causation and especially if it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.690" end="00:14:21.770" style="s2">multifactorial right like we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:23.540" style="s2">cause and we&#39;re usually quite good in</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.770" end="00:14:26.390" style="s2">western medicine if it&#39;s an acute cause</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.540" end="00:14:28.730" style="s2">right injury or acute infection or acute</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.390" end="00:14:30.530" style="s2">poisoning is quite obvious right and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.730" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">then you reverse that acute cause but if</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.530" end="00:14:33.740" style="s2">the cause is time-delayed</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s hard to find out what it was or</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.740" end="00:14:37.700" style="s2">it&#39;s multifactorial there are multiple</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">things that are involved independently</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.700" end="00:14:41.900" style="s2">or multiple sequence steps there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:43.730" style="s2">causal cascade it&#39;s hard to actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.900" end="00:14:47.390" style="s2">understand what it is and so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.730" end="00:14:50.330" style="s2">cluster symptoms into disease names but</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.390" end="00:14:52.490" style="s2">if we look at what was the path of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.330" end="00:14:56.330" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis that led to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.490" end="00:14:58.310" style="s2">this person&#39;s MS or cancer or rheumatism</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.330" end="00:15:00.230" style="s2">a hundred different MSS have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.310" end="00:15:01.970" style="s2">different paths of ideologies right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.230" end="00:15:03.620" style="s2">there are commonalities and then but</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.970" end="00:15:05.870" style="s2">this is why personalized medicine is so</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.620" end="00:15:07.280" style="s2">critical so generally given the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.870" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">understanding cause has been difficult</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.280" end="00:15:11.960" style="s2">the focus has largely not been on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.340" style="s2">actually in balance and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.960" end="00:15:14.690" style="s2">correct it because it&#39;s not a small</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.340" end="00:15:16.670" style="s2">number of things right it&#39;s usually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.690" end="00:15:19.070" style="s2">large number of things right the focus</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.670" end="00:15:21.530" style="s2">has largely been is there some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.070" end="00:15:23.570" style="s2">exhaustion ischemic or treatment that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.530" end="00:15:26.200" style="s2">can give that will limit the symptom</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.570" end="00:15:28.280" style="s2">ology or some aspect of pathogenesis and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.200" end="00:15:30.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve that&#39;s better than not doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.280" end="00:15:32.060" style="s2">anything but we can take the next step</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.080" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">in our science etc is good enough to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.060" end="00:15:35.959" style="s2">take the next step into our</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.290" end="00:15:38.180" style="s2">focuses rather than give some exogenous</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.959" end="00:15:40.190" style="s2">external override to an internal</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.180" end="00:15:41.720" style="s2">regulatory system that is radically</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.190" end="00:15:43.910" style="s2">complex and intelligent and brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.720" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">let&#39;s work to understand what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.910" end="00:15:48.380" style="s2">wrong with the regulatory systems or</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:50.899" style="s2">deficient in them and up regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.380" end="00:15:53.750" style="s2">regulatory capacity of the system so</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.899" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentally more adaptive more</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.750" end="00:15:58.550" style="s2">resilient etc I&#39;ve done research in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:01.190" style="s2">condition of narcolepsy for over 10</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.550" end="00:16:02.360" style="s2">years now gosh maybe 15 and I have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.190" end="00:16:04.579" style="s2">example that&#39;s relevant to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.360" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">talking about narcoleptics are missing a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.579" end="00:16:09.050" style="s2">protein in their brain called hypocretin</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:12.410" style="s2">one result of that pathology is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.050" end="00:16:14.920" style="s2">excessive daytime sleepiness which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.410" end="00:16:17.209" style="s2">what usually is synonymous with the word</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.920" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">narcolepsy for most people but another</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.209" end="00:16:22.490" style="s2">symptom is called cataplexy which is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:24.649" style="s2">loss of muscle tone or partial paralysis</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.490" end="00:16:26.810" style="s2">when somebody experiences emotion</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.649" end="00:16:29.269" style="s2">usually so Daniel you tell me a joke and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.810" end="00:16:31.579" style="s2">I experienced weakness in my limbs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.269" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">in fact it might be where the term weak</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.579" end="00:16:35.029" style="s2">from laughter comes from narcoleptics</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:36.290" style="s2">also experience depression with greater</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.029" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">frequency than the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.290" end="00:16:40.370" style="s2">population so early on in the treatment</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:41.990" style="s2">of this condition narcoleptics were</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.370" end="00:16:43.670" style="s2">given a class of drugs called tricyclic</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.990" end="00:16:45.319" style="s2">antidepressants turns out that this</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.670" end="00:16:46.550" style="s2">medication also improves patient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.319" end="00:16:48.470" style="s2">cataplexy which was totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.550" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">serendipitous but the medication is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.470" end="00:16:52.459" style="s2">directly confronting the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:53.630" style="s2">narcolepsy but rather it is ameliorating</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.459" end="00:16:56.149" style="s2">one of the symptoms but only temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.630" end="00:16:57.529" style="s2">so here&#39;s the problem tricyclics do</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.149" end="00:16:59.269" style="s2">reduce cataplectic attacks in these</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.529" end="00:17:01.339" style="s2">patients but the medication loses its</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.269" end="00:17:02.600" style="s2">potency over time over the course of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.339" end="00:17:05.209" style="s2">several months patient will build up</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.600" end="00:17:06.860" style="s2">tolerance to the drug and they will take</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.209" end="00:17:08.780" style="s2">what&#39;s called the drug holiday to allow</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.860" end="00:17:10.699" style="s2">the receptors to resend ties to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.780" end="00:17:12.709" style="s2">medication and in this scenario however</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.699" end="00:17:15.110" style="s2">when a patient goes off of the drug they</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.709" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">are essentially paralyzed for days at a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.110" end="00:17:17.870" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:20.449" style="s2">and where they&#39;re having up to 60</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.870" end="00:17:21.860" style="s2">cataplectic attacks per day so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.449" end="00:17:24.380" style="s2">basically have to stay in bed until the</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.460" end="00:23:35.030" style="s2">experience in mood elevation with qualia</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.350" end="00:23:37.309" style="s2">how did I notice well I caught myself</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.030" end="00:23:38.900" style="s2">saying hi to random strangers more on</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.309" end="00:23:41.000" style="s2">the street and generally just feeling</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.900" end="00:23:42.290" style="s2">more outgoing and at first I was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.000" end="00:23:44.990" style="s2">little worried about this because things</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.290" end="00:23:46.520" style="s2">that can elevate mood also are subject</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.990" end="00:23:49.549" style="s2">to a reduced mood later but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.520" end="00:23:51.799" style="s2">experience a dip and either the day of</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.799" end="00:23:55.429" style="s2">don&#39;t take qualia and on that note you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.870" end="00:23:57.559" style="s2">instruct people to take the weekend off</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.429" end="00:23:59.210" style="s2">from taking it which I do but again I</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.559" end="00:24:01.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel the dip and energy focused</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.210" end="00:24:03.350" style="s2">mood which indicates to me that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.280" end="00:24:04.730" style="s2">created really supports the health of</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.820" end="00:24:11.630" style="s2">depleted later and lastly I also noticed</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.250" end="00:24:13.580" style="s2">that I have really good sleep when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.630" end="00:24:15.169" style="s2">on qualia but even on the days where I</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.000" end="00:24:29.530" style="s2">testimonial for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.640" end="00:24:32.380" style="s2">a couple things on that first two</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.530" end="00:24:35.800" style="s2">disclaimers on our side one is not a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.380" end="00:24:37.720" style="s2">drug right and treat anything and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.800" end="00:24:41.430" style="s2">not prescribed for any diagnosed things</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.720" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">etc this is a supplement without FDA</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:49.420" style="s2">thing is that we are absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.260" end="00:24:52.060" style="s2">recommending it as a way to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.420" end="00:24:54.700" style="s2">lack of sleep as far as general</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.060" end="00:24:57.250" style="s2">lifestyle optimization goes exercise</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.700" end="00:24:59.260" style="s2">matters Food Matters mindset matters</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.250" end="00:25:01.210" style="s2">being outdoors matters there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.260" end="00:25:03.130" style="s2">things that matter we probably put sleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.210" end="00:25:05.260" style="s2">in its own category and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.130" end="00:25:06.910" style="s2">in the second category in terms of just</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.260" end="00:25:09.430" style="s2">how important it is for overall</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.910" end="00:25:11.830" style="s2">physiology or there and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.430" end="00:25:13.270" style="s2">things that we push heavily is to really</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.830" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">support people getting enough and good</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.270" end="00:25:18.940" style="s2">quality sleep and that Galia works</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:20.380" style="s2">radically better in well-rested people</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.940" end="00:25:22.690" style="s2">than in people that are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.380" end="00:25:24.460" style="s2">some sleep deficit so just that public</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.690" end="00:25:26.470" style="s2">service announcement yep and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.460" end="00:25:28.450" style="s2">with that fully as a sleep researcher</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.470" end="00:25:31.150" style="s2">there is nothing that&#39;s been identified</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.450" end="00:25:32.740" style="s2">that replaces the need for sleep what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.150" end="00:25:35.410" style="s2">would say is that I think I perform</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.740" end="00:25:38.050" style="s2">better but that does not encourage me in</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.410" end="00:25:40.390" style="s2">any way to then cheat sleep there is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.050" end="00:25:41.950" style="s2">exponential benefit to getting better</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.390" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">sleep and then having quality in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.950" end="00:25:46.770" style="s2">system then getting not enough sleep on</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:49.150" style="s2">a regular basis if someone is getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.770" end="00:25:51.340" style="s2">insufficient amounts of sleep acutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.150" end="00:25:53.830" style="s2">rarely then we&#39;re gonna deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.340" end="00:25:54.520" style="s2">much better than chronic sleep deficit</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.830" end="00:25:56.230" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.520" end="00:25:58.540" style="s2">even if we&#39;re only talking about an hour</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.230" end="00:26:00.670" style="s2">less than the person actually needs but</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.540" end="00:26:02.680" style="s2">over a period of time I can really start</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.670" end="00:26:04.150" style="s2">to have profound effects so yeah moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.680" end="00:26:05.290" style="s2">on to the effects you experience I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.150" end="00:26:07.390" style="s2">delayed because you said things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.290" end="00:26:08.680" style="s2">related to most of the goals we had in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.390" end="00:26:11.080" style="s2">the development of this particular</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.680" end="00:26:13.390" style="s2">product so one thing that we said was</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.080" end="00:26:16.120" style="s2">essential to our focus was how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.390" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">regulate regulatory capacity rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.120" end="00:26:21.370" style="s2">up regulate particular state right</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:23.950" style="s2">mm-hmm in a way then creates external</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.370" end="00:26:25.960" style="s2">dependence and so we saw how many people</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.950" end="00:26:27.880" style="s2">were using adderall not even on</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.960" end="00:26:29.920" style="s2">prescription for appropriate purposes</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.880" end="00:26:32.050" style="s2">but off-label as a way to get through</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.920" end="00:26:35.020" style="s2">midterms or finals or their tech startup</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.050" end="00:26:37.230" style="s2">or whatever and it&#39;s a dopamine agonist</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.020" end="00:26:39.490" style="s2">but it is one it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.230" end="00:26:40.730" style="s2">flatlining your dopamine while you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.490" end="00:26:43.130" style="s2">it as opposed to how</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.730" end="00:26:44.600" style="s2">your dopamine responsive your dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.130" end="00:26:45.650" style="s2">regulary system responsive to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.600" end="00:26:46.970" style="s2">happening because we don&#39;t want the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.650" end="00:26:48.500" style="s2">dopamine levels all the time right or</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.970" end="00:26:50.179" style="s2">any neurotransmitter we want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.500" end="00:26:52.220" style="s2">responsive so our state can shift to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.179" end="00:26:55.190" style="s2">appropriate to the environment mm-hmm -</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.220" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2">it&#39;s affecting dopamine without paying</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.190" end="00:27:00.380" style="s2">attention to its relationship in healthy</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:02.210" style="s2">cognitive function to acetylcholine than</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.380" end="00:27:03.860" style="s2">to so many other transmitters and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.210" end="00:27:06.440" style="s2">aspects of transmission and post</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.860" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">synaptic d1 d2 receptor sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.440" end="00:27:12.440" style="s2">etc so you end up getting imbalances and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.790" style="s2">really key ratios and dynamics mm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.440" end="00:27:16.460" style="s2">that we&#39;ll end up looking like with</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.790" end="00:27:18.230" style="s2">increasing focus but not increasing key</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.460" end="00:27:20.450" style="s2">aspects of memory or even decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.230" end="00:27:23.210" style="s2">some of them or things decreasing things</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.450" end="00:27:26.059" style="s2">like empathy or presence right and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.210" end="00:27:28.730" style="s2">because you are getting in exitus</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.059" end="00:27:29.929" style="s2">override to a key in chain chemical it</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.730" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">can create dependence and down</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.929" end="00:27:33.980" style="s2">regulations yeah so our goal was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:36.380" style="s2">exact opposite it was we know people</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.980" end="00:27:37.490" style="s2">weren&#39;t going to use something if they</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.380" end="00:27:39.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel it right away</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.490" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">it would just fit in category with all</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.290" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">their other vitamins and supplements so</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:46.010" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t produce the kinds of immediate</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.990" style="s2">effects that they were looking for but</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.010" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">we wanted it in a way that would not</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.990" end="00:27:52.100" style="s2">produce long term down-regulation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:55.669" style="s2">that would ideally produce meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.100" end="00:27:58.010" style="s2">long-term upregulation well even in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.669" end="00:28:00.020" style="s2">short-term having a much wider scope of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.010" end="00:28:02.419" style="s2">positive impact so can we increase focus</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.020" end="00:28:04.100" style="s2">and concentration and short-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.419" end="00:28:07.100" style="s2">and working memory long-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.100" end="00:28:08.900" style="s2">creativity analysis synthesis all at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.100" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">same time and a lot of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.900" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">actually almost opposite functions like</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:15.740" style="s2">the ability to stay very focused</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:17.690" style="s2">independent of environmental noise but</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.740" end="00:28:19.250" style="s2">then the ability to tasks which when one</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.690" end="00:28:20.450" style="s2">needs a tasks which are opposite kinds</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.250" end="00:28:23.510" style="s2">of functions but we really want them</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.450" end="00:28:26.360" style="s2">both mm-hmm the ability to have very</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.510" end="00:28:27.410" style="s2">high Drive but also to be able to let go</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.360" end="00:28:28.790" style="s2">of it and be empathetically</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.410" end="00:28:31.490" style="s2">interpersonally responsive when</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.790" end="00:28:33.710" style="s2">necessary mm-hmm analytic and synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.490" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">and so our focus was can we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.710" end="00:28:38.870" style="s2">comprehensive brain chemistry in</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:42.169" style="s2">real-time that makes people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.870" end="00:28:46.940" style="s2">up-regulates comprehensive capacities</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.169" end="00:28:48.650" style="s2">that is also up regulating over the long</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.940" end="00:28:51.230" style="s2">term and so those those are the things</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.650" end="00:28:53.990" style="s2">that we saw and we have been quite happy</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.230" end="00:28:54.620" style="s2">with what&#39;s happened so far though one</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.990" end="00:28:57.500" style="s2">of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.620" end="00:29:00.350" style="s2">component to my feedback is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.500" end="00:29:01.670" style="s2">recommend you take qualia during the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.350" end="00:29:04.580" style="s2">week and then you don&#39;t take it on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.670" end="00:29:07.070" style="s2">weekends I still feel very energetic I</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.580" end="00:29:08.990" style="s2">feel my brain is actually even smarter</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.070" end="00:29:11.180" style="s2">having taken it but not having to my</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.990" end="00:29:13.130" style="s2">system on a weekend so that would</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.180" end="00:29:18.140" style="s2">support what your end goal was here one</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.130" end="00:29:20.990" style="s2">thing I&#39;ll say about that is the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.140" end="00:29:25.850" style="s2">most addictive chemical that&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.990" end="00:29:27.800" style="s2">stack is caffeine and that&#39;s a chemical</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.850" end="00:29:30.020" style="s2">whose addiction curve most people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.800" end="00:29:31.790" style="s2">pretty familiar with and it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.020" end="00:29:33.470" style="s2">benign everyone metabolize is caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.790" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">differently and some people can drink it</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.470" end="00:29:37.190" style="s2">daily for quite some time and then not</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:39.470" style="s2">drink it and be fine other people will</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.190" end="00:29:41.809" style="s2">get headaches and it does have a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.470" end="00:29:44.360" style="s2">do with caffeine metabolism which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.809" end="00:29:46.670" style="s2">genetic and other factors so what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:48.470" style="s2">say is this has a relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.670" end="00:29:50.570" style="s2">amount of caffeine we have 90 milligrams</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.470" end="00:29:53.570" style="s2">but in the unique form where it&#39;s bound</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.570" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">to an antioxidant the antioxidant from</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.570" end="00:29:58.550" style="s2">blueberry skins pterostilbene which has</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:00.800" style="s2">it basically be slow release so it feels</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.550" end="00:30:02.660" style="s2">like 30 milligrams when it kicks on</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.800" end="00:30:04.309" style="s2">which is very very subtle but then it</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.660" end="00:30:05.960" style="s2">lasts for quite some time so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.309" end="00:30:08.600" style="s2">getting a spike in a drop off you get a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.960" end="00:30:09.740" style="s2">very subtle long-term effect yeah why</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.600" end="00:30:11.179" style="s2">it&#39;s important to take in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.740" end="00:30:13.580" style="s2">again because it will last longer for</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.179" end="00:30:15.590" style="s2">people who are used to drinking a big</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.580" end="00:30:17.090" style="s2">Starbucks where they&#39;ve got 152</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.590" end="00:30:19.010" style="s2">milligrams of caffeine the kicks in</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.090" end="00:30:20.330" style="s2">right away they will still want to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.010" end="00:30:21.800" style="s2">that they just might down regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.330" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">amount a little bit cuz this isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.800" end="00:30:25.850" style="s2">match with that amount of caffeine but</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:28.010" style="s2">on people&#39;s off days we tell people to</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.850" end="00:30:30.740" style="s2">do five days on two days off qualia so</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.010" end="00:30:32.420" style="s2">that they don&#39;t desensitize to any of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.740" end="00:30:35.059" style="s2">the chemicals that are here on their off</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.420" end="00:30:36.800" style="s2">days if you can&#39;t get off caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.059" end="00:30:38.179" style="s2">without headaches and you can still do</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.800" end="00:30:40.820" style="s2">your coffee or monta or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.179" end="00:30:42.230" style="s2">on your off days caffeine doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.820" end="00:30:44.420" style="s2">cycle that&#39;s frequently those other</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.230" end="00:30:45.710" style="s2">chemicals and so what we&#39;d say is our</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.420" end="00:30:47.690" style="s2">recommendation is that people should</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.710" end="00:30:49.580" style="s2">cycle off caffeine if they use it on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.690" end="00:30:52.190" style="s2">daily basis for about one week per</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.580" end="00:30:54.200" style="s2">quarter hmm so their adenosine cycle</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.190" end="00:30:56.690" style="s2">gets to reset the other dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.200" end="00:30:58.460" style="s2">are involved get reset and we do find</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.690" end="00:31:00.740" style="s2">that people will start getting decreased</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.460" end="00:31:02.510" style="s2">meaning for response from caffeine over</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.740" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">longer periods of time obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.510" end="00:31:06.230" style="s2">problems if people are using it again as</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:07.400" style="s2">a replacement for sleep or to push</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.230" end="00:31:08.299" style="s2">through too much fatigue when they</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.400" end="00:31:10.519" style="s2">actually need rest</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.299" end="00:31:11.629" style="s2">yeah if people are well-rested and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.519" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">they&#39;re taking appropriate amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.629" end="00:31:14.599" style="s2">caffeine and it can actually be an</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:16.580" style="s2">efficiency increase our metabolically</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.599" end="00:31:19.489" style="s2">for their system so we say two days off</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.580" end="00:31:21.739" style="s2">of quality each week and one week off of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.489" end="00:31:23.509" style="s2">all stimulants per quarter I was never</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.739" end="00:31:25.580" style="s2">much of a coffee drinker growing now</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.509" end="00:31:28.009" style="s2">several years ago I started to drink it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.580" end="00:31:29.269" style="s2">and it became a part of my daily routine</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.009" end="00:31:31.669" style="s2">rather fast</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.269" end="00:31:34.009" style="s2">I enjoy my coffee with cream and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.669" end="00:31:36.200" style="s2">recognized that I was adding hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.009" end="00:31:38.450" style="s2">calories to my to my day from my coffee</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.200" end="00:31:40.429" style="s2">routine we know from an energy balance</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.450" end="00:31:42.109" style="s2">perspective that the body doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.429" end="00:31:44.089" style="s2">compensate for calories that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.109" end="00:31:46.269" style="s2">consumed in liquid form as much as it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.089" end="00:31:49.099" style="s2">does when they&#39;re consumed in solid form</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.269" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">so now I get my morning boost without</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.099" end="00:31:52.249" style="s2">those additional calories and honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:53.989" style="s2">thought I was gonna have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.249" end="00:31:55.999" style="s2">giving up my coffee but that&#39;s not been</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.989" end="00:31:58.969" style="s2">the case so this is another reason why I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.999" end="00:32:01.309" style="s2">enjoy qualia when I think bulletproof</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.969" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">coffee has become as popular as it has</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.309" end="00:32:06.019" style="s2">this is a topic people are aware of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:08.419" style="s2">because they&#39;re putting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.019" end="00:32:10.339" style="s2">calories in the form of MCT or xct oil</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.419" end="00:32:11.959" style="s2">in there you know and butter but if</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.339" end="00:32:13.579" style="s2">someone is doing that and then eating</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.959" end="00:32:15.619" style="s2">the same breakfast that kind of missing</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.579" end="00:32:17.839" style="s2">the point right exactly most people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.619" end="00:32:19.639" style="s2">doing that to then not eat breakfast for</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.839" end="00:32:21.079" style="s2">quite some time or they need to down</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.639" end="00:32:21.589" style="s2">regulate the caloric intake of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.079" end="00:32:24.109" style="s2">breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.589" end="00:32:29.089" style="s2">right yeah exactly I was doing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.109" end="00:32:31.129" style="s2">latter what other tools do you use to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.089" end="00:32:33.589" style="s2">either monitor your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.129" end="00:32:36.349" style="s2">performance or to enhance it assessment</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.589" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">wise there are some apps that are fun</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.349" end="00:32:41.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a quantified mind of them is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:44.509" style="s2">publicly available app that anybody can</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.779" end="00:32:45.979" style="s2">use inexpensive and then there are some</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.509" end="00:32:47.719" style="s2">apps that you can pay just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.979" end="00:32:50.029" style="s2">for that have a lot of increased</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.719" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">capacities like Cambridge brain science</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.029" end="00:32:53.029" style="s2">app there&#39;s actually two different</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:55.190" style="s2">Cambridge associate cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.029" end="00:32:57.169" style="s2">assessments Berkeley&#39;s greater good</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.190" end="00:32:59.599" style="s2">science center has a positive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.169" end="00:33:02.029" style="s2">assessment UPenn has some pretty great</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.599" end="00:33:03.769" style="s2">non-symbolic experience assessments so</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.029" end="00:33:06.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of good online</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.769" end="00:33:08.389" style="s2">assessments we have a friend dr. Zachary</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.529" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">Stein who was in the education</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.389" end="00:33:11.959" style="s2">department philosophy education at</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:14.059" style="s2">Harvard and worked with Howard Gardner</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.059" end="00:33:18.079" style="s2">of intelligence and I would say is one</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:19.969" style="s2">of the top theorists in developmental</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.079" end="00:33:21.650" style="s2">psychology he and a group of friends</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.969" end="00:33:24.290" style="s2">made a assessment system</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.650" end="00:33:26.450" style="s2">electic a-- and to go to left or you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.290" end="00:33:28.370" style="s2">see it which is probably in all that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.450" end="00:33:30.110" style="s2">aware of the most advanced human</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.370" end="00:33:32.090" style="s2">cognitive psychological assessment</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.110" end="00:33:33.740" style="s2">system anywhere and it assesses for</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.090" end="00:33:35.990" style="s2">things like how complex someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.740" end="00:33:38.570" style="s2">thinking is how abstract their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.990" end="00:33:40.610" style="s2">is levels of moral reasoning a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.570" end="00:33:42.410" style="s2">things beyond basic psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.610" end="00:33:44.330" style="s2">cognitive assessment using really quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.410" end="00:33:46.010" style="s2">deep and good and want models so those</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.330" end="00:33:47.240" style="s2">are ones that we like in sport we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.010" end="00:33:50.270" style="s2">actually working on synthesizing</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.240" end="00:33:52.460" style="s2">elements from many of those into apps</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.270" end="00:33:53.690" style="s2">that can provide better resources for</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.460" end="00:33:55.520" style="s2">people in the futures one of our goals</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.690" end="00:33:58.610" style="s2">so those are some things as far as</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.520" end="00:34:01.040" style="s2">biometrics go I use a lot of blood</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.610" end="00:34:03.620" style="s2">chemistry testing for mmm-hmm biometric</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.040" end="00:34:05.780" style="s2">assessment and I&#39;m a big fan of qejy</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.620" end="00:34:07.490" style="s2">assessment I&#39;m a big fan bio data and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.780" end="00:34:09.110" style="s2">psycho data and then the key becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.490" end="00:34:10.280" style="s2">interpretive process to be able to put</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.110" end="00:34:12.200" style="s2">it together and really understand what</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.280" end="00:34:13.310" style="s2">it means to have to it the hard part</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.200" end="00:34:14.510" style="s2">hard that&#39;s the part we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.310" end="00:34:16.460" style="s2">focused on is because the data</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.510" end="00:34:18.590" style="s2">collection is getting better on Moore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.460" end="00:34:20.030" style="s2">Law curve we&#39;re focused on how do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.590" end="00:34:21.320" style="s2">actually play all the various parts</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.030" end="00:34:22.820" style="s2">together where you&#39;re not just looking</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.320" end="00:34:24.140" style="s2">at each thing in relationship to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.820" end="00:34:25.850" style="s2">reference range but each thing in</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.850" end="00:34:28.970" style="s2">get a center just a picture yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.500" end="00:34:31.700" style="s2">then as far as other things for</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.970" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">cognitive performance enhancements so</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.700" end="00:34:36.080" style="s2">things I do personally there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:38.990" style="s2">cognitive chemistry that I play with and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.080" end="00:34:41.330" style="s2">so Walia is a base stack I still even</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.520" end="00:35:33.770" style="s2">one of the foundational ones so enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.890" end="00:35:35.690" style="s2">sleep meditation everyday exercise that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.770" end="00:35:38.150" style="s2">is focused specifically and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.690" end="00:35:40.579" style="s2">obviously we get neurogenesis from</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.069" end="00:35:47.450" style="s2">important etcetera but new skill</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.500" end="00:35:49.130" style="s2">acquisition is huge for neurogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.450" end="00:35:50.510" style="s2">more than anything else and new skill</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.130" end="00:35:51.799" style="s2">acquisition in the form of learning new</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.510" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">languages learning new musical</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.799" end="00:35:55.910" style="s2">instruments but it seems right now that</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.910" end="00:36:00.440" style="s2">coordination motor functions has the</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.440" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">new neural pathways and so the key is</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.349" end="00:36:06.680" style="s2">whenever you try and do some new</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:08.450" style="s2">activity like say you&#39;re gonna slackline</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.680" end="00:36:10.220" style="s2">or you&#39;re gonna whatever that requires a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.450" end="00:36:12.289" style="s2">balance or coordination you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.220" end="00:36:15.230" style="s2">have and it seems almost impossible your</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.289" end="00:36:17.270" style="s2">your nervous system is trying to use the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.230" end="00:36:19.130" style="s2">much larger bandwidth of other than</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.270" end="00:36:20.660" style="s2">conscious processing to handle it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.130" end="00:36:23.150" style="s2">just conscious processing but that means</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.660" end="00:36:24.559" style="s2">driving new neural circuits and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.150" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">start to get a hang of it as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.559" end="00:36:27.829" style="s2">start to get a hang of it that effect</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:30.230" style="s2">starts decreasing but if process you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.829" end="00:36:32.839" style="s2">actually increased the neural hardware</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.230" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">for automating learning and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.839" end="00:36:37.160" style="s2">switch and do some other one and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:39.829" style="s2">continuously focusing on things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.160" end="00:36:41.690" style="s2">really hard until they start to become</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.829" end="00:36:44.059" style="s2">easy and then switching again that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.690" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">hardware where you take new learning and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.059" end="00:36:47.869" style="s2">automate it then translates to new</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:49.160" style="s2">cognitive and interpersonal and</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.869" end="00:36:50.660" style="s2">psychologic things that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.160" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">hear rate of learning goes up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.660" end="00:36:53.960" style="s2">there&#39;s many more but those are a few</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.329" style="s2">examples there&#39;s an approach to physical</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.960" end="00:36:57.740" style="s2">activity that i promote called in tune</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.329" end="00:37:00.650" style="s2">training it stands for</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.740" end="00:37:02.869" style="s2">integrative and opportunistic training</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.650" end="00:37:04.190" style="s2">the goals of it are this to support a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.869" end="00:37:07.279" style="s2">sufficiency of physical activity in</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.190" end="00:37:09.140" style="s2">one&#39;s life to reduce longer periods of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.279" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">sedentary time so even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.140" end="00:37:13.039" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s getting a good total</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">amount of physical activity think of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.039" end="00:37:16.579" style="s2">weekend warrior concept where somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:18.440" style="s2">is getting all their physical activity</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.579" end="00:37:21.049" style="s2">during the weekend but they&#39;re largely</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.440" end="00:37:22.789" style="s2">sedentary during the week in tune helps</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.049" end="00:37:24.680" style="s2">you fit smaller bursts of physical</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.789" end="00:37:26.750" style="s2">activity into your days which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.680" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">easier to make it more regular one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.750" end="00:37:30.230" style="s2">the objectives of the program is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:32.119" style="s2">optimize mental performance and it does</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.230" end="00:37:34.010" style="s2">it in several ways first there are brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.119" end="00:37:35.960" style="s2">benefits to regular physical activity</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.010" end="00:37:37.430" style="s2">second there are acute benefits to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.960" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">getting physical activity within your</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.430" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">day especially when you&#39;re active</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:43.880" style="s2">activity isn&#39;t too intense and third</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:46.220" style="s2">since it instructs you to do some but</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.880" end="00:37:47.930" style="s2">not a lot of physical activity day by</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.220" end="00:37:48.950" style="s2">day you&#39;re left with a good energetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.930" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">reserve and what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.950" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">is that when I do workout in this manner</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:57.260" style="s2">I wake up with a lot of energy every</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:59.420" style="s2">single day so that is validating to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.260" end="00:38:01.550" style="s2">concept and then lastly I also dance</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.420" end="00:38:03.349" style="s2">during the day so I try to mix in more</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.550" end="00:38:05.089" style="s2">complex movement patterns aside from</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.349" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">just squats and push-ups and this sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.089" end="00:38:09.260" style="s2">of whole body coordination supports</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:10.520" style="s2">cognitive strength and in support of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.260" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">that idea as well I also have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.520" end="00:38:13.700" style="s2">slackline outside which I use for</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:17.089" style="s2">similar purposes I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.700" end="00:38:19.460" style="s2">specific insights that can teach people</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.089" end="00:38:21.800" style="s2">what is optimum more like what we just</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.460" end="00:38:24.170" style="s2">talked about with the benefit of dancer</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.800" end="00:38:26.030" style="s2">slack minor balance whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.170" end="00:38:28.280" style="s2">everyone knows quite a bit that they</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.030" end="00:38:31.160" style="s2">don&#39;t fully apply already hard to things</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.280" end="00:38:31.940" style="s2">like sleep and exercise and lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.160" end="00:38:33.859" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things I&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.940" end="00:38:35.990" style="s2">excited about the dear human operating</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.859" end="00:38:37.490" style="s2">system as you continue is all the kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.990" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">of behavioral support dynamics you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.490" end="00:38:41.000" style="s2">building in so that people can actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:43.609" style="s2">start getting traction so yeah max I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.000" end="00:38:45.560" style="s2">delighted to see that in you awful well</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.609" end="00:38:47.570" style="s2">last question for you what would you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.560" end="00:38:49.730" style="s2">tell somebody who has never taken</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.570" end="00:38:52.130" style="s2">nootropics before but is curious to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.730" end="00:38:54.260" style="s2">drive them do some research mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.130" end="00:38:56.150" style="s2">educate yourself that is gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.260" end="00:38:58.190" style="s2">general mo for me in any health</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.150" end="00:38:59.210" style="s2">well-being performance related topic</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.190" end="00:39:01.700" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.210" end="00:39:03.470" style="s2">one of the core kind of concepts means</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.700" end="00:39:05.060" style="s2">that we hold really heavily here no</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.470" end="00:39:07.609" style="s2">hacker is topic of empowered</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.060" end="00:39:09.380" style="s2">responsibility and that the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.609" end="00:39:10.819" style="s2">people take relatively little</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.380" end="00:39:14.089" style="s2">responsibility for their longevity</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.460" end="00:39:20.420" style="s2">tell them what to do and then have side</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.589" end="00:39:21.650" style="s2">effects and get mattad yeah the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.420" end="00:39:23.900" style="s2">for it is just lame it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.650" end="00:39:25.490" style="s2">right no and so since you&#39;re the one</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.900" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2">that lives in your body and your minds</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.490" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">you just gotta take full</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:31.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand how it works great</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.480" end="00:39:33.230" style="s2">a hundred percent well said that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.430" end="00:39:36.109" style="s2">key thing that we would say is study</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.230" end="00:39:37.910" style="s2">learn and then do experiments as they</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.109" end="00:39:40.970" style="s2">seem appropriate to you that you feel</p>
