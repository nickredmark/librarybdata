<p begin="00:05:08.190" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">sensual perception of psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.900" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s not reality is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.390" end="00:05:23.800" style="s2">modulating one sensory perception is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.320" end="00:05:26.500" style="s2">like a technological and modulating one</p>
