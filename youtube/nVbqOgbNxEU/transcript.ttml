<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">I think we decided to focus this</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">conversation around Zach&#39;s most recent</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:27.180" style="s2">essay yep called kovat 19 a war broke</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">out in heaven mm-hmm and I was really</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.180" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">happy to read this because it was so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">mythopoetic so mythological and because</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">I&#39;m a sucker for that kind of language</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">and I also thought it was quite brave</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:41.399" style="s2">because nobody&#39;s writing like that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">make the very strong statement that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.399" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a war in heaven and using this</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">strong eschatological terminology is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:56.789" style="s2">that am I saying that right and I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.440" style="s2">thinking about why that was so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.789" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">and I was thinking about Leonard Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">and I was thinking about Bob Dylan and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:04.280" style="s2">was thinking about how they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">singing about the end of the world like</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.280" end="00:01:10.189" style="s2">in some level like there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">flood that&#39;s gonna come and and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.189" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a crack in everything and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">know things are get a slide in all</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">directions and all these sort of lines</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">from from popular music we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">into my mind which is very biblical in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:28.460" style="s2">some sense and that&#39;s probably one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">the reasons why I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.460" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">Zak&#39;s essay and it&#39;s also I think a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">reason why other people might be quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">critical of it because the people once</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">want a more rational explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">not the ER essay was was not not</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">rational or reasonable but so could we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:51.000" style="s2">speak about that can we speak about why</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">you&#39;re using this kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:56.270" style="s2">language and why it&#39;s important and why</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:01:58.770" style="s2">I think I think your essay seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.270" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">making the rounds in other words it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">affecting people</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">in one way or another sure thank you I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.450" style="s2">mean I I&#39;m still actually surprised by</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">the reception of the paper I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.450" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">very happy I didn&#39;t expect it to be as</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">as well received as it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:23.420" style="s2">because I mostly expected people to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:29.870" style="s2">you know cautious or worried about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.420" end="00:02:32.810" style="s2">mythopoetic angle but I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.870" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">trying to draw attention it as clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.810" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">as I could to the interior aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">the crisis too and to specifically have</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:51.560" style="s2">something to say that wasn&#39;t directly</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:53.900" style="s2">about the biology and the geopolitics</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.560" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">and all the dynamics that are within</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.900" end="00:03:04.300" style="s2">this and yeah and some of it was also</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:09.650" style="s2">just in my own experience returning to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.300" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">where I go for solace right like as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.650" end="00:03:14.570" style="s2">was looking out at the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:18.950" style="s2">coming from like the spiritual crown you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.570" end="00:03:21.590" style="s2">know and just terrible a lot of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.950" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">terrible like an insulting I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.590" end="00:03:30.500" style="s2">insulting and a retreat to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:31.910" style="s2">relativistic pre tragic spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.500" end="00:03:34.610" style="s2">escapism</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.910" end="00:03:36.049" style="s2">so can you characterize that describe</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.610" end="00:03:37.549" style="s2">what is so so terrible and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.049" end="00:03:40.489" style="s2">something about you know let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.549" end="00:03:43.480" style="s2">spiritual reaction to well I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.489" end="00:03:45.739" style="s2">and again it it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.480" end="00:03:47.959" style="s2">complex because there&#39;s there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.739" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">in the religious landscape now right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.959" end="00:03:54.049" style="s2">you still have the grip traditions you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">know the church and and the Sangha and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.049" end="00:03:57.890" style="s2">all these things would still exist from</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">the great traditions I&#39;m talking mostly</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.890" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">about the non-affiliated kind of human</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.900" end="00:04:09.410" style="s2">potential movement New Age movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:10.840" style="s2">crowd at least in America where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.410" end="00:04:16.100" style="s2">this strange confluence between</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.840" end="00:04:17.479" style="s2">post-modernism and Buddhism and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.100" end="00:04:19.729" style="s2">particular where you get this like</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.479" end="00:04:21.609" style="s2">allegiance between the deconstructing of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.729" end="00:04:23.650" style="s2">truth by Kozma</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.609" end="00:04:25.659" style="s2">which is something specific like</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.650" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">something specific and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.659" end="00:04:32.889" style="s2">deconstructing of like experience of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:36.759" style="s2">self and reality in terms of some</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.889" end="00:04:38.440" style="s2">discourses in Buddhism right and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.759" end="00:04:39.550" style="s2">specifically Buddhism and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.440" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">people I&#39;m talking about really haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.550" end="00:04:44.919" style="s2">even like read a Buddhist Sutra but what</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:46.569" style="s2">they&#39;re getting is the notion that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.919" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">you analyze your own experience like of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.569" end="00:04:50.050" style="s2">a boss and a meditator you will realize</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:51.909" style="s2">that most of the things you take to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.050" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">true or not simply true right that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.909" end="00:04:59.310" style="s2">there&#39;s some deeper reality beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:02.020" style="s2">kind of given phenomenology so emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.310" end="00:05:05.289" style="s2">different than form mostly we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.020" end="00:05:07.659" style="s2">experience I&#39;m Dennis although even it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.289" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">always already there and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.659" end="00:05:11.080" style="s2">post-modernism is doing something</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:12.759" style="s2">specific in linguistics all right taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.080" end="00:05:14.440" style="s2">aim at the modern notion of objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.759" end="00:05:15.699" style="s2">and these other things and so you give</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.440" end="00:05:19.560" style="s2">this confidence where you get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.699" end="00:05:25.719" style="s2">relativistic post-modernism with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.560" end="00:05:28.900" style="s2">particular brand of kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.719" end="00:05:31.090" style="s2">criticism of the kind of conventional</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.900" end="00:05:35.080" style="s2">reality let&#39;s say it&#39;s the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.090" end="00:05:38.380" style="s2">criticism and so though you end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.080" end="00:05:41.500" style="s2">getting people denying that viruses</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.380" end="00:05:44.620" style="s2">exist right and that we have bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.500" end="00:05:49.979" style="s2">any right / correct and thanking the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.620" end="00:05:53.379" style="s2">virus and writing a whole long things</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.979" end="00:05:54.370" style="s2">where they end up saying that actually I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.379" end="00:05:55.870" style="s2">don&#39;t believe any of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.370" end="00:05:57.250" style="s2">saying that&#39;s not right we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.870" end="00:05:58.629" style="s2">believe anything you can&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.250" end="00:06:00.190" style="s2">anything we don&#39;t know anything but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.629" end="00:06:02.169" style="s2">here&#39;s a long Vista this list of things</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.190" end="00:06:05.229" style="s2">I believe but I don&#39;t really believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.169" end="00:06:08.379" style="s2">that and so there&#39;s a lack of courage</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.229" end="00:06:12.190" style="s2">and spiritual fortitude on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.379" end="00:06:16.389" style="s2">those people who are or are people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.190" end="00:06:18.159" style="s2">looking to for that and so yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.389" end="00:06:21.550" style="s2">it&#39;s just concerning and it&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.159" end="00:06:25.659" style="s2">it&#39;s still still going on you know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.550" end="00:06:27.159" style="s2">that kind of that kind of view so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.659" end="00:06:29.409" style="s2">some sense this was a response to that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.159" end="00:06:30.849" style="s2">was trying to you know as you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.409" end="00:06:34.049" style="s2">not an unreasonable peace but I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.849" end="00:06:37.979" style="s2">the peace is not unreasonable and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.049" end="00:06:40.719" style="s2">reasonable things about profound topics</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.979" end="00:06:44.139" style="s2">instead of thinking that saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.719" end="00:06:45.399" style="s2">something unreasonable is profound just</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.139" end="00:06:47.289" style="s2">because it&#39;s unreasonable or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.399" end="00:06:50.169" style="s2">unreasonable when me and John we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.289" end="00:06:53.499" style="s2">talking the last time with Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.169" end="00:06:56.469" style="s2">or master of Pietro in the midst of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.499" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">conversation I came up with this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.469" end="00:07:00.579" style="s2">thing I said this is like a judgment or</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.110" end="00:07:02.709" style="s2">something right what&#39;s happening it just</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.579" end="00:07:05.649" style="s2">came into my mind right as a biblical</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.709" end="00:07:07.869" style="s2">language and John was I was saying wait</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.649" end="00:07:10.269" style="s2">a minute hold on here be careful</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.869" end="00:07:14.919" style="s2">so maybe John you want to speak to to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.269" end="00:07:17.019" style="s2">the cut your cautionary sure a response</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.919" end="00:07:19.239" style="s2">to the dangers of using this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.019" end="00:07:21.879" style="s2">language and how can we use this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.239" end="00:07:24.399" style="s2">poetic language correctly or rightly or</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.879" end="00:07:25.689" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s helpful and I think Zach</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.399" end="00:07:27.969" style="s2">did a great job of doing it I do</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.689" end="00:07:30.249" style="s2">attitude so first of all compliment Zach</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.969" end="00:07:33.399" style="s2">I read the article and I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.249" end="00:07:37.779" style="s2">exemplary of how to use what I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.399" end="00:07:39.969" style="s2">call symbolic language in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.779" end="00:07:42.999" style="s2">important bridges symbol on to connect</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.969" end="00:07:44.739" style="s2">between the phenomenological and what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.999" end="00:07:46.119" style="s2">might call the ontological because I saw</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.739" end="00:07:48.189" style="s2">that a large part of what the essay was</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.119" end="00:07:50.050" style="s2">doing was exactly using what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.189" end="00:07:51.729" style="s2">calling myth or poetic language to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.050" end="00:07:53.709" style="s2">bridge between those two domains for</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.729" end="00:07:56.469" style="s2">people in a very powerful way and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.709" end="00:07:58.419" style="s2">think that&#39;s very important we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.469" end="00:08:00.099" style="s2">about that more as we go into our</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.419" end="00:08:02.199" style="s2">discussion but I think that how do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.099" end="00:08:04.719" style="s2">how do you get craft a language that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.199" end="00:08:06.489" style="s2">you know deeply transgender that deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.719" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">resonates with people&#39;s phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.489" end="00:08:11.889" style="s2">experience and yet also gives them you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:13.689" style="s2">know a way of articulating a grasp on</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.889" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">reality that is very needed right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.689" end="00:08:18.159" style="s2">and I thought what Zach was doing was</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:20.139" style="s2">exemplifying that very well that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.159" end="00:08:24.339" style="s2">it landed for me that that&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.139" end="00:08:27.449" style="s2">language was coming up the biblical and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.339" end="00:08:29.829" style="s2">so the biblical language</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.449" end="00:08:32.199" style="s2">I&#39;ve often cautioned people I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.829" end="00:08:33.789" style="s2">most appropriate attitude toward the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.199" end="00:08:36.819" style="s2">Bible is a deeply reverential</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.789" end="00:08:39.219" style="s2">ambivalence the Bible is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.819" end="00:08:43.419" style="s2">terrible book in the sense of its</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.219" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">capacity to cause great harm but also in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.419" end="00:08:47.110" style="s2">its terrific in the sense that it can</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.339" style="s2">induce</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:53.420" style="s2">significant powerful and transformation</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.339" end="00:08:55.970" style="s2">in people so the biblical language my</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.420" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">concern is I share one with Zack and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.970" end="00:09:01.180" style="s2">then one that I think he might have also</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:04.629" style="s2">I think he&#39;s he steered very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.180" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">adroitly between Scylla and Charybdis</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.629" end="00:09:09.559" style="s2">they&#39;re very nicely</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">between a fundamentalist return of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.559" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">language because my concern is and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:15.860" style="s2">seen a lot of people talking this way</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:18.709" style="s2">the virus is very much like an Old</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.309" end="00:09:32.779" style="s2">feel like we&#39;re being punished we feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.069" end="00:09:34.249" style="s2">like we have to invoke purity codes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.779" end="00:09:38.120" style="s2">this is a very ancient way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.249" end="00:09:41.720" style="s2">for us and it&#39;s very problematic I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.120" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2">it would be very antithetical to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.720" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">direction that Zack is pointing to in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.120" end="00:09:51.050" style="s2">his paper in his article if we if that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:53.059" style="s2">kind of thing becomes prevalent and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.050" end="00:09:54.589" style="s2">the alternative and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.059" end="00:09:56.209" style="s2">an exclusive alternative although the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.589" end="00:09:57.769" style="s2">culture pretends that they are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.209" end="00:10:00.559" style="s2">alternative is is the kind of decadent</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.769" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">Romanticism that Zack put his finger on</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.559" end="00:10:05.420" style="s2">that spirituality that lacks integrity</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">not only courage Zack I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.420" end="00:10:09.649" style="s2">lacks integrity in that what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:11.059" style="s2">it privileges certain kinds of discourse</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.649" end="00:10:13.459" style="s2">well of course claiming that no</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.059" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2">discourse has privilege it claims a kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.459" end="00:10:16.999" style="s2">of exceptionalism for Buddhism that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.170" end="00:10:19.309" style="s2">people like Stephen bachelor and Evan</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.999" end="00:10:22.939" style="s2">Thompson have just shown is without</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.309" end="00:10:24.769" style="s2">merit as an argument it does a very poor</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.939" end="00:10:26.620" style="s2">job opposite I would say to what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.769" end="00:10:31.059" style="s2">were trying to do Zack and succeeding at</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.620" end="00:10:31.059" style="s2">bridging between the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t set up an agave what it does</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.069" end="00:10:37.850" style="s2">is it says all everything is to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:39.499" style="s2">constructed in here everything is</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.850" end="00:10:41.449" style="s2">deconstructed out there and therefore I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.499" end="00:10:43.759" style="s2">ultimately get some kind of nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.449" end="00:10:45.230" style="s2">conformity between my inner world and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.759" end="00:10:50.300" style="s2">outer world because they&#39;re all equally</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.230" end="00:10:53.749" style="s2">deconstructed which is I think precious</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.300" end="00:10:59.179" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of irresponsible in a in a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.749" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">powerful way so I think I didn&#39;t I I saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.179" end="00:11:02.290" style="s2">Jack</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:04.960" style="s2">like I say steering between both of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.290" end="00:11:07.330" style="s2">those ways in which we could start using</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.960" end="00:11:09.880" style="s2">I agree with Zack fundamentally on this</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.330" end="00:11:11.110" style="s2">that when were in liminal right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.880" end="00:11:13.930" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.110" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">and the ontology are in this like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.930" end="00:11:18.760" style="s2">deep like talk to each other when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:20.860" style="s2">in liminal we are drawn towards this</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.760" end="00:11:23.860" style="s2">kind of language I totally agree what</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.860" end="00:11:26.530" style="s2">I&#39;m suggesting is the what the we can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.860" end="00:11:28.450" style="s2">drawn and then we can articulate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.530" end="00:11:30.820" style="s2">appropriate that language in three</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.450" end="00:11:32.650" style="s2">different ways at least to my mind one</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.820" end="00:11:34.600" style="s2">is the one that Zack is very critical of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.650" end="00:11:36.430" style="s2">and I am too a sort of decadent</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.600" end="00:11:40.090" style="s2">romanticism that has that purely</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.430" end="00:11:42.180" style="s2">negative and I think vacuous conformity</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.090" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.180" end="00:11:47.860" style="s2">fundamentalism that I think especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:49.540" style="s2">when we&#39;re enacting purity codes is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.860" end="00:11:51.070" style="s2">very real danger and you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.540" end="00:11:54.760" style="s2">attendant things upon it you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.070" end="00:11:56.290" style="s2">conspiracy theory scapegoating before</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.760" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">all things we have to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.290" end="00:12:02.260" style="s2">careful of and so I thought that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:04.360" style="s2">Zack did was from and perhaps act this</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.260" end="00:12:05.770" style="s2">is one of the reasons why it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.360" end="00:12:08.410" style="s2">getting such a great reception I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.770" end="00:12:09.790" style="s2">you in addition to the content which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.410" end="00:12:12.670" style="s2">think was valuable I think you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.790" end="00:12:15.160" style="s2">exemplified a way of appropriating this</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.670" end="00:12:19.750" style="s2">language that as I again I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.160" end="00:12:22.060" style="s2">you is what is going to emerge as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.750" end="00:12:24.490" style="s2">response to the attempt to symbol on to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.060" end="00:12:27.250" style="s2">connect the phenomenological logical and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.490" end="00:12:29.050" style="s2">you steered it between the two things</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.250" end="00:12:30.700" style="s2">that I&#39;m most concerned of well I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.050" end="00:12:33.790" style="s2">three there were two I&#39;ve articulated</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.700" end="00:12:35.980" style="s2">one is the fundamentalism the other is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.790" end="00:12:37.540" style="s2">you know like you say the completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.980" end="00:12:39.340" style="s2">decadent romantic magical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.540" end="00:12:41.320" style="s2"> I would put it I&#39;m using that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.340" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">term technically right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:45.070" style="s2">third one I have a fear of which you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:48.520" style="s2">also didn&#39;t do you very great care of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.070" end="00:12:50.830" style="s2">which is a kind of pretentious utopian</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.520" end="00:12:53.020" style="s2">certainty well you know this clearly</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.830" end="00:12:55.060" style="s2">indicates that the revolution should</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.020" end="00:12:58.300" style="s2">come and this is a blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.060" end="00:13:00.820" style="s2">right and that kind of thing too and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.300" end="00:13:02.770" style="s2">right and and and and and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.820" end="00:13:04.440" style="s2">danger of course around apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.770" end="00:13:08.170" style="s2">thinking to fall into that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.440" end="00:13:10.660" style="s2">utopic pseudo certainty and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.170" end="00:13:12.130" style="s2">shared between all three of those really</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.660" end="00:13:14.860" style="s2">really well so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.130" end="00:13:18.550" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s sorry to drop maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.860" end="00:13:21.160" style="s2">there&#39;s also a danger of sort of with</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.550" end="00:13:22.600" style="s2">this eschatology is life hating or</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.160" end="00:13:23.830" style="s2">something it&#39;s like you want the</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.830" end="00:13:28.990" style="s2">well that overlaps a lot with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.260" end="00:13:32.740" style="s2">fundamentalism fundamentalism tends to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.990" end="00:13:35.640" style="s2">you know you know the emphasis is on the</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.640" end="00:13:38.890" style="s2">and in it</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:41.230" style="s2">that&#39;s usually bound up with a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.190" end="00:14:02.380" style="s2">view there are actually isomorphic in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.310" end="00:14:04.510" style="s2">their structure like yes yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.380" end="00:14:07.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a basically kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.510" end="00:14:10.330" style="s2">structural narcissism yes and a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.450" end="00:14:13.090" style="s2">to project and basically it stands of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.330" end="00:14:16.330" style="s2">like mind or faith only which ends up</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.090" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2">being you create your reality kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.330" end="00:14:23.590" style="s2">thing or basically you get what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:25.630" style="s2">deserve yes and so that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.590" end="00:14:27.610" style="s2">just there and as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.630" end="00:14:29.620" style="s2">developmental psychologist it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.610" end="00:14:31.720" style="s2">see the places and people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.620" end="00:14:36.640" style="s2">personalities where they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.720" end="00:14:41.530" style="s2">retreat to lower forms of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.640" end="00:14:43.150" style="s2">and self regulation so so you allowed it</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.530" end="00:14:45.190" style="s2">to that very clearly when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.150" end="00:14:47.410" style="s2">about the possibility of losing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.190" end="00:14:49.000" style="s2">world&#39;s soul and falling in with this</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.410" end="00:14:50.410" style="s2">type in I just wanted to unpack that a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.000" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">little bit because I thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.410" end="00:14:54.970" style="s2">implying and and just to add to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:57.250" style="s2">also tragic you talked about the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.970" end="00:14:58.690" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s a remedy to this New</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.250" end="00:15:01.750" style="s2">Age thinking is for us to really</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.690" end="00:15:04.810" style="s2">contemplate the tragic right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.750" end="00:15:06.430" style="s2">think of John as you were speaking I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.810" end="00:15:08.890" style="s2">thinking of this phrase by Harbor moss</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.430" end="00:15:12.040" style="s2">it was something like cuz you know he</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.890" end="00:15:13.690" style="s2">brought his dissertation on shelling and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.040" end="00:15:15.570" style="s2">the problem of free will and then later</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.690" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">in his life habermas returned to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.570" end="00:15:19.630" style="s2">Kierkegaard and began to consider</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">religion again very seriously and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.630" end="00:15:25.779" style="s2">this later work he talked about the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">untapped semantic potentials of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.779" end="00:15:31.749" style="s2">while Gorge that third there lay within</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:34.329" style="s2">religious language and and symbol</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.749" end="00:15:36.220" style="s2">untapped semantic potential specifically</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.329" end="00:15:38.649" style="s2">and then this is it to think for</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.220" end="00:15:40.990" style="s2">protecting vulnerable forms of community</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.649" end="00:15:44.439" style="s2">life and experience so the idea being</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.990" end="00:15:49.029" style="s2">that the meaning that lies hidden within</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.439" end="00:15:51.730" style="s2">these symbolic ways of speaking it has</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.029" end="00:15:55.569" style="s2">to do with the basis of choice making</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.730" end="00:15:57.399" style="s2">and relationship and ethics Frank which</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.569" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">is also another difference between I</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.399" end="00:16:02.620" style="s2">think what I was trying to do and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:06.339" style="s2">is usually happening under the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.620" end="00:16:09.899" style="s2">kind of rhetoric which is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.339" end="00:16:12.939" style="s2">to inform the basis of ethics and choice</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.899" end="00:16:15.069" style="s2">not the basis of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.939" end="00:16:16.920" style="s2">self-regulation and the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.069" end="00:16:19.779" style="s2">safety base of a and self-esteem</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.920" end="00:16:22.559" style="s2">gratifications right so those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.779" end="00:16:25.779" style="s2">distinct and the mind wants to do bother</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.559" end="00:16:27.459" style="s2">like you want to create a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.779" end="00:16:29.499" style="s2">meaning in a worldview that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.459" end="00:16:34.689" style="s2">feel safe and makes you feel valuable</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.499" end="00:16:36.309" style="s2">and important and in control and but you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.689" end="00:16:39.100" style="s2">also want to create one that allows you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.309" end="00:16:40.540" style="s2">to live in relationship to reality and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.100" end="00:16:45.220" style="s2">specifically the reality that you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.540" end="00:16:47.860" style="s2">other people and and so yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.220" end="00:16:53.639" style="s2">trying to really bring home something</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.860" end="00:16:55.720" style="s2">like in an ethos and and the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.639" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">you know for lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.720" end="00:17:02.290" style="s2">morality which is relevant now which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:04.360" style="s2">why I was concerned about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.290" end="00:17:06.370" style="s2">able to say on a hospital ward in New</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.360" end="00:17:10.740" style="s2">York City right like one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.370" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">get that can be said in these places and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.740" end="00:17:17.169" style="s2">how important that must be right able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:18.819" style="s2">say the right things to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.169" end="00:17:20.500" style="s2">actually suffering not people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.819" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">afraid of suffering and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.500" end="00:17:24.760" style="s2">reconcile themselves and the calm their</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:27.640" style="s2">limbic system after looking at Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.760" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">for an hour and a half people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.640" end="00:17:33.010" style="s2">the midst of it and where are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.330" style="s2">cultural resources we can use in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.010" end="00:17:36.290" style="s2">languages that are available in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.330" end="00:17:38.570" style="s2">symbols that are shared between us</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.290" end="00:17:42.860" style="s2">can be with one another in the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.570" end="00:17:44.090" style="s2">intensity of this and say something so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.860" end="00:17:46.310" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of where where it came from</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.090" end="00:17:48.680" style="s2">and then I ended up returning to my</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.310" end="00:17:50.780" style="s2">roots in Emerson and other places where</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.680" end="00:17:54.500" style="s2">I was looking for this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.780" end="00:17:57.830" style="s2">language so and also just to my</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.500" end="00:17:59.630" style="s2">background in music you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.830" end="00:18:03.890" style="s2">often about this triplet kid I got from</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.630" end="00:18:06.830" style="s2">Forrest Landry which is song text and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.890" end="00:18:10.010" style="s2">code P in different forms of expression</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.830" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">and that all of them are important and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.010" end="00:18:13.100" style="s2">code is about what you do so let it be</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:14.930" style="s2">written so let it be done like a legal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.100" end="00:18:17.240" style="s2">code right and text is about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.930" end="00:18:19.550" style="s2">interest objective clarity of semantics</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.240" end="00:18:22.790" style="s2">basically precision song is different</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.550" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">song is rooted and subjective and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.790" end="00:18:29.180" style="s2">is where symbol and image lives so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.340" end="00:18:30.170" style="s2">and so connecting song with text is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.180" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">I was trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.170" end="00:18:34.190" style="s2">well not cuz I&#39;m not right about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:35.690" style="s2">facts and legal code and the quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.190" end="00:18:36.680" style="s2">and how the keeper saw I wasn&#39;t good to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.690" end="00:18:39.530" style="s2">him in there I was just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.680" end="00:18:41.720" style="s2">connect with the song that I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.530" end="00:18:45.890" style="s2">to sing and finding a way to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.720" end="00:18:47.780" style="s2">up into some space of reason and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.890" end="00:18:50.570" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about is poetry you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.780" end="00:18:53.660" style="s2">correct right and and and a need for</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.570" end="00:18:55.700" style="s2">that right but the problem of just</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.660" end="00:18:58.280" style="s2">invoking poetry again is in poetry</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.700" end="00:19:00.560" style="s2">because of you know several generations</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.280" end="00:19:02.270" style="s2">and education has been relegated to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.560" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">certain status and function with another</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.270" end="00:19:07.910" style="s2">culture but I think is not I not</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:09.650" style="s2">attributing this to you Andrew but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.910" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">saying how most people knew when most</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.650" end="00:19:13.820" style="s2">people hear the word poetry they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:16.100" style="s2">hear what&#39;s that for yeah that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.820" end="00:19:18.530" style="s2">yeah right they don&#39;t and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.100" end="00:19:20.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge educational thrust</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.530" end="00:19:21.530" style="s2">towards the end of Zach&#39;s article but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.270" end="00:19:23.030" style="s2">wanted to pick up on something first</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.530" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">before I do want to turn to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.030" end="00:19:29.930" style="s2">educational stuff because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">really important so if the first point</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.930" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">you were saying about that Zach is the -</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:37.580" style="s2">um this goes to where Chris and I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:39.680" style="s2">been doing about trying to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.580" end="00:19:41.690" style="s2">when we invoke the language the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.680" end="00:19:44.090" style="s2">has both the homing and the horror</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.690" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">aspects to it right at the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.090" end="00:19:48.380" style="s2">sacred yes is if it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:50.090" style="s2">shelter us but it&#39;s also supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.380" end="00:19:52.100" style="s2">expose us to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.090" end="00:19:57.799" style="s2">a reality that is beyond us that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.100" end="00:19:59.929" style="s2">numinous side of things and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.799" end="00:20:01.490" style="s2">really difficult thing that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.929" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">do right now with the symbolic language</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.490" end="00:20:07.610" style="s2">is write its effect because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:08.779" style="s2">ultimately sacred language is to craft</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.610" end="00:20:11.179" style="s2">it in such a way that those two things</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.779" end="00:20:14.690" style="s2">are being done at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.179" end="00:20:17.900" style="s2">we&#39;re giving people a sense of how they</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.690" end="00:20:21.710" style="s2">can get grounded and centered but also</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.900" end="00:20:23.270" style="s2">challenge them to face the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.710" end="00:20:26.110" style="s2">transformative demands that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.270" end="00:20:29.330" style="s2">placing upon us and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.110" end="00:20:31.309" style="s2">another concern I have is a polarization</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.330" end="00:20:34.010" style="s2">of the language of the sacred either</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.309" end="00:20:35.990" style="s2">into the oh it&#39;s you know it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.010" end="00:20:38.600" style="s2">wonderful we&#39;re all snuggly and warm and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.990" end="00:20:40.390" style="s2">we all love each other or or or you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.600" end="00:20:42.679" style="s2">which is also becoming the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.390" end="00:20:44.299" style="s2">horrific nihilism with its you know</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.220" end="00:22:35.179" style="s2">ago Andrew sorry Zack it was that right</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.130" end="00:22:38.120" style="s2">that you&#39;re trying to link this language</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.179" end="00:22:39.410" style="s2">to being able to say the right thing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.120" end="00:22:41.809" style="s2">do the right it&#39;s ultimately you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.809" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">language and this fear you&#39;re a party</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.690" end="00:22:49.669" style="s2">and care right well but that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.720" end="00:22:51.470" style="s2">part the rationality of caring is what</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.669" end="00:22:53.720" style="s2">Socrates was primarily about above and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.470" end="00:22:55.250" style="s2">beyond any rationality of argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.720" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">he makes that very clear the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.250" end="00:23:00.140" style="s2">he knew was Tata he knew how to properly</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:03.799" style="s2">care and what to care about and how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.140" end="00:23:05.330" style="s2">care but that Britta but the invoking</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.799" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">Socrates brings up this whole thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.330" end="00:23:08.690" style="s2">been trying to talk about this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:11.390" style="s2">faith Socratic faith because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.690" end="00:23:13.340" style="s2">relationship to symbols is not one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.390" end="00:23:14.799" style="s2">conviction in the sense and of the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.340" end="00:23:17.540" style="s2">in which the argument convict&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">neither should be and zack is critical</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.540" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">of this just kind of an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:24.290" style="s2">affective response that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:26.210" style="s2">inappropriate response to symbols i mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.290" end="00:23:28.070" style="s2">so my tutor here is Tillich that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.210" end="00:23:31.040" style="s2">appropriate response to symbol is faith</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.070" end="00:23:33.770" style="s2">but faith completely understood not as</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.040" end="00:23:35.750" style="s2">this magical projection and willful</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.770" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">assertion or passive</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.750" end="00:23:40.730" style="s2">you know acceptance of you know some</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:42.830" style="s2">fatalistic demon but more again this</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.730" end="00:23:45.350" style="s2">ability to what Zack is again I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.830" end="00:23:48.140" style="s2">exemplifying in his paper which is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.350" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">sense the Kairos sense the course of</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.140" end="00:23:52.970" style="s2">things and become deeply coupled and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:54.440" style="s2">involved with it and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.970" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">something that needs to be talked about</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.440" end="00:23:58.429" style="s2">and it&#39;s also something that we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:01.280" style="s2">offer people now as an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.429" end="00:24:03.830" style="s2">either magical faith or you know merely</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.280" end="00:24:05.210" style="s2">sort of assertion or faith and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.830" end="00:24:07.100" style="s2">that&#39;s also something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.210" end="00:24:09.260" style="s2">brought into this discussion and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.100" end="00:24:11.480" style="s2">is that again I don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.260" end="00:24:14.570" style="s2">foreign to your article Zack I think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.480" end="00:24:16.490" style="s2">you&#39;re clearly exemplifying it in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.570" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about and the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.490" end="00:24:19.970" style="s2">you&#39;re invoking the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:22.909" style="s2">language almost in a prophetic fashion I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.970" end="00:24:25.220" style="s2">totally want I just want to repeat what</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.909" end="00:24:27.500" style="s2">you said about the importance maybe of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.220" end="00:24:31.549" style="s2">joining those two worlds together right</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.500" end="00:24:34.370" style="s2">that the the the horror and and the fate</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.549" end="00:24:37.549" style="s2">that&#39;s what I am and if we if we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.370" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">in the sublime blissful world of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.549" end="00:24:41.779" style="s2">imagination it&#39;s nice but we never come</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:44.809" style="s2">down to the earth and if we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.779" end="00:24:47.029" style="s2">just in in this sort of materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.809" end="00:24:48.440" style="s2">horror you don&#39;t have any vision so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.029" end="00:24:52.490" style="s2">it&#39;s bringing these two worlds together</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.440" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">I think that&#39;s exactly and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.490" end="00:24:55.340" style="s2">saying is that act of bringing them</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:57.710" style="s2">together is of course inherently</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.340" end="00:25:00.470" style="s2">symbolic I keep saying symbol on is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.710" end="00:25:03.559" style="s2">join together across the limit all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.470" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">and that because you&#39;re confronting the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.559" end="00:25:08.419" style="s2">liminal you&#39;re confronting those both</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">you know the the prospect and the refuge</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.419" end="00:25:13.340" style="s2">and I think what gives you that I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:17.090" style="s2">is this kind of faith that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.340" end="00:25:19.429" style="s2">about now and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a faith that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.090" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">in my opinion and and I argue it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.429" end="00:25:23.059" style="s2">than my opinion who cares about my</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:24.710" style="s2">opinion my arguments are that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.059" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">notion of faith is deeply interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.710" end="00:25:29.480" style="s2">with this more extended Socratic notion</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">of rationality and the wisdom project</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.480" end="00:25:35.020" style="s2">that I think exact is invoking in the</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.620" end="00:25:44.600" style="s2">directions to go now like I&#39;m wondering</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.600" end="00:25:49.190" style="s2">mind what comes to mind for me is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.429" end="00:25:52.010" style="s2">notion of the the post tragic and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.190" end="00:25:53.960" style="s2">notion I was thinking of the future I</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.010" end="00:25:56.210" style="s2">was thinking of the prophetic and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.960" end="00:25:58.220" style="s2">the future and how we use symbols</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.210" end="00:25:59.809" style="s2">because we can&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.220" end="00:26:02.090" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the immediacy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.809" end="00:26:04.970" style="s2">what&#39;s happening so we use symbols as</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.090" end="00:26:07.640" style="s2">kind of a vehicle to take us towards the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.970" end="00:26:11.419" style="s2">future is that does that ring true in</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.620" end="00:27:27.330" style="s2">working with working with the thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.740" end="00:27:30.659" style="s2">of the heart essentially and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.330" end="00:27:34.029" style="s2">science technically right and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.659" end="00:27:37.809" style="s2">logic and argument in the in a strict</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.029" end="00:27:41.289" style="s2">sense but it&#39;s also not illogical and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.809" end="00:27:43.330" style="s2">irrational or based on just phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.289" end="00:27:45.429" style="s2">experience or ecstatic experience or</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.330" end="00:27:48.190" style="s2">those kind of things so it&#39;s this hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.429" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">language like you&#39;re saying which which</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.190" end="00:27:52.510" style="s2">brings the two together and then it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:54.070" style="s2">take the particular take the best of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.510" end="00:27:57.010" style="s2">science and does not contradict that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.070" end="00:27:59.590" style="s2">and it can take the best of the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.010" end="00:28:01.809" style="s2">and the purely prophetic and those</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.590" end="00:28:05.019" style="s2">things and bring them together and good</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.809" end="00:28:07.960" style="s2">and thoughts of the heart are the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.019" end="00:28:11.139" style="s2">universal thoughts and forms of language</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.960" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">and so they are a kind of common sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.139" end="00:28:19.779" style="s2">if I can use that way of speaking but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:22.029" style="s2">they do sometimes end up being cloaked</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.779" end="00:28:25.480" style="s2">in things that look like traditional</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.029" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">religious forms of language and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.480" end="00:28:29.080" style="s2">that&#39;s I find the biggest trick now</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:32.410" style="s2">when I&#39;m working with these modalities</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.080" end="00:28:36.190" style="s2">is to not basically offend the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.410" end="00:28:38.620" style="s2">scientists right one issue and then the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:39.910" style="s2">other issue is not to to make it complex</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.620" end="00:28:42.580" style="s2">enough that you don&#39;t get it confused</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.910" end="00:28:43.480" style="s2">that&#39;s just being New Age all right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.580" end="00:28:45.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.480" end="00:28:47.860" style="s2">offend the scientists who dismiss you as</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.040" end="00:28:49.330" style="s2">being fundamentalists or something and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.860" end="00:28:51.940" style="s2">then you also don&#39;t want to attract a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.330" end="00:28:54.370" style="s2">bunch of people who are actually looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.940" end="00:28:56.980" style="s2">for something much simpler just to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.370" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">gratify their ego needs for safety and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.980" end="00:29:05.980" style="s2">control justice a new age market coerce</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:08.050" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the death dance and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.980" end="00:29:11.560" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of overwhelmed actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.050" end="00:29:14.500" style="s2">the key to getting the the the praise</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.560" end="00:29:19.060" style="s2">for the paper I read wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.500" end="00:29:20.350" style="s2">expecting it but yeah so that&#39;s what one</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.060" end="00:29:22.060" style="s2">of the things that came to mind there</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.350" end="00:29:25.540" style="s2">and then as I was saying this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.060" end="00:29:31.180" style="s2">that the sacred includes the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:32.890" style="s2">terrifying and that is also that with</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.180" end="00:29:35.110" style="s2">this notion of the post tragic being</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.890" end="00:29:38.680" style="s2">extremely important some have talked</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.110" end="00:29:43.270" style="s2">about in a few podcasts and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.680" end="00:29:46.210" style="s2">being that when tragedies there he it</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.270" end="00:29:49.300" style="s2">must be lived through yeah it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.210" end="00:29:51.610" style="s2">avoided and dealing with it actually it</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.300" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean fixing it or making the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.610" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">tragic disappear dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:30:02.490" style="s2">actually means finding a way to have it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:30:06.660" style="s2">and more and I talked about what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.490" end="00:30:11.920" style="s2">within illness and what is within death</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.660" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">that unravel it from the inside which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.920" end="00:30:17.680" style="s2">to say as hospice workers know and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:19.450" style="s2">health care workers now and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.680" end="00:30:27.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a caregiver for many years in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.450" end="00:30:28.120" style="s2">my life and that there is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">right way to say it</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.120" end="00:30:39.470" style="s2">you know yeah so I&#39;ll use symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:42.169" style="s2">language right which is that God</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.470" end="00:30:43.730" style="s2">we&#39;ll catch you it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.169" end="00:30:46.519" style="s2">is that you there&#39;s nowhere you can fall</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.730" end="00:30:49.820" style="s2">where you fall outside of God right</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.519" end="00:30:52.429" style="s2">something like that and and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.820" end="00:30:58.340" style="s2">includes all of the horror right that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.429" end="00:31:01.789" style="s2">God is within that darkness and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.340" end="00:31:03.799" style="s2">so so again it&#39;s not about being stuck</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.789" end="00:31:08.360" style="s2">in the tragedy and saying oh it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.799" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">horror right as I know it is horror but</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.360" end="00:31:16.519" style="s2">humans can withstand our they and humans</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:19.490" style="s2">are made in the midst of tragedy so so</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.519" end="00:31:23.269" style="s2">much of history has been humans making</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.490" end="00:31:25.399" style="s2">personhood in the midst of tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.269" end="00:31:27.320" style="s2">so again the untapped semantic potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.399" end="00:31:29.629" style="s2">of religious language is for protecting</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:32.629" style="s2">vulnerable forms of human life these are</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.629" end="00:31:35.769" style="s2">the things we&#39;ve done to be together and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.629" end="00:31:38.360" style="s2">with glad hearts in the midst of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.769" end="00:31:42.460" style="s2">that&#39;s where the Bible is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.360" end="00:31:46.580" style="s2">because it is so political so political</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.460" end="00:31:48.139" style="s2">slavery and freedom and unjust ends</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.580" end="00:31:52.039" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these stories of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.139" end="00:31:56.029" style="s2">in intense and plagues of course people</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.039" end="00:32:00.919" style="s2">in intense intense interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.029" end="00:32:06.679" style="s2">and so so yeah it&#39;s not abstract in many</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.919" end="00:32:10.549" style="s2">cases the Bible&#39;s just there and and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.679" end="00:32:13.639" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s that there&#39;s that encoding</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.549" end="00:32:15.529" style="s2">and human experience of making meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.639" end="00:32:18.740" style="s2">and personhood in the midst of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.529" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">and and so that&#39;s just I&#39;m saying when</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.740" end="00:32:22.519" style="s2">we&#39;re bringing these languages together</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.970" end="00:32:24.980" style="s2">you know to what end it&#39;s because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.519" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">think in part of that need to create the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.980" end="00:32:30.110" style="s2">new religion right this new form of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:31.730" style="s2">religiosity would be it&#39;s coming at us</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.110" end="00:32:33.710" style="s2">again now at a higher register that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.730" end="00:32:35.480" style="s2">demand from the world that&#39;s saying look</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.710" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">at look at the suffering of the pain</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:39.350" style="s2">that&#39;s unfolding and how do we come</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:41.480" style="s2">together in the midst of this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.350" end="00:32:46.190" style="s2">about what we&#39;re trying to do here in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.480" end="00:32:48.679" style="s2">sense with the creation of a new a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.190" end="00:32:53.179" style="s2">renew resources of symbol</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.679" end="00:32:56.269" style="s2">language for meaning-making yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.179" end="00:33:01.820" style="s2">maybe the guy in in the hospital in New</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.269" end="00:33:03.950" style="s2">York doesn&#39;t have time for figuring</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.820" end="00:33:07.340" style="s2">things out in a very reductive way he</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.950" end="00:33:12.289" style="s2">just wants the truth and the truth has</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.340" end="00:33:16.249" style="s2">to be deep right it can&#39;t be superficial</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.289" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">or or and and I guess the kind of God</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.249" end="00:33:20.090" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking of you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">their that and that contains both the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.090" end="00:33:26.269" style="s2">darkness and the light or both the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.279" style="s2">horror and and the beauty so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.269" end="00:33:30.860" style="s2">you don&#39;t want one you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.279" end="00:33:33.049" style="s2">split those two you want you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.860" end="00:33:35.840" style="s2">on your deathbed I imagine I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.049" end="00:33:38.029" style="s2">been on my deathbed but you would want</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:41.419" style="s2">things to be as close to the bone and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.029" end="00:33:43.009" style="s2">is true as as possible and I often</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.419" end="00:33:47.299" style="s2">religious language may be the only way</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.009" end="00:33:50.409" style="s2">to to express that I don&#39;t know well or</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.299" end="00:33:54.169" style="s2">the heart spoken as directly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.409" end="00:33:55.700" style="s2">but but the thing is it has to take yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.169" end="00:33:58.190" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing I mean there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.700" end="00:34:00.129" style="s2">worse than these words being spoken and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.190" end="00:34:03.049" style="s2">they don&#39;t take for the person right</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.129" end="00:34:06.350" style="s2">indeed that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get out</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.049" end="00:34:08.179" style="s2">with this this notion of faith where</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.350" end="00:34:10.460" style="s2">it&#39;s again not willful assertion not</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.179" end="00:34:12.109" style="s2">magical thinking are not claiming to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.460" end="00:34:14.210" style="s2">know things that you don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.109" end="00:34:15.290" style="s2">any claim to know it&#39;s not a pretense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.210" end="00:34:17.629" style="s2">certainty it&#39;s not all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.290" end="00:34:21.290" style="s2">we sort of pretend faith is no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.629" end="00:34:24.679" style="s2">it&#39;s rather the sense there&#39;s a beauty</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.290" end="00:34:25.909" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean a a pleasure because</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.679" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">beauty can be terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.909" end="00:34:30.109" style="s2">Rilke reminds us of that repeatedly but</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:30.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a beauty to these symbols for</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.109" end="00:34:32.089" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.679" end="00:34:34.250" style="s2">there&#39;s they&#39;re they have a receptivity</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.089" end="00:34:36.649" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get at so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.250" end="00:34:40.040" style="s2">they take the symbols take they catch</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.649" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">they write today they join the worlds</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.040" end="00:34:45.260" style="s2">together they they afford aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:47.089" style="s2">they call the person to the depths that</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.089" end="00:34:51.079" style="s2">really interested in that by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.980" end="00:34:52.339" style="s2">want to point out you know when Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.079" end="00:34:55.399" style="s2">was doing his thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.339" end="00:34:57.859" style="s2">Athens was literally under siege from</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.399" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">without and there had literally been a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.859" end="00:35:01.640" style="s2">devastating plague in the city so</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:03.740" style="s2">Socrates is not also know</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.640" end="00:35:07.160" style="s2">figure that is somehow you know abstract</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.740" end="00:35:10.250" style="s2">in the ivory power you know well we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.160" end="00:35:12.859" style="s2">in the midst of pestilence and killing</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.250" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">with each fact we&#39;re all of you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.859" end="00:35:17.210" style="s2">everything well many of the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:19.400" style="s2">are actually even historically set and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.210" end="00:35:22.059" style="s2">that in that time period so Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.400" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">completely apropos for the situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.059" end="00:35:29.329" style="s2">we&#39;re in but when I&#39;m interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:31.010" style="s2">is is good well I invoked him and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.329" end="00:35:33.619" style="s2">because I he seemed to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.010" end="00:35:36.170" style="s2">that he seemed to be yellow like Zack</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.619" end="00:35:37.730" style="s2">said he can he could adjust himself to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.170" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">the interlocutor he had the faith of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.730" end="00:35:41.329" style="s2">being able to show up and he had the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.970" style="s2">faith that he could say things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.329" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">would take that people would you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.970" end="00:35:49.549" style="s2">that you know the that would tempt them</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:50.599" style="s2">towards the good that would call them to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.549" end="00:35:52.819" style="s2">their deaths</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.599" end="00:35:55.220" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting to me what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.819" end="00:35:57.559" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.220" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">is ultimately what I want to really get</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.559" end="00:36:02.029" style="s2">to with Zack stop was what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:06.950" style="s2">educational background that makes people</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.029" end="00:36:08.990" style="s2">capable of appropriately being called by</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.950" end="00:36:11.390" style="s2">these symbols so that they take and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.990" end="00:36:13.519" style="s2">they&#39;re operationally viable to them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.390" end="00:36:16.819" style="s2">people who where it falls dead on their</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.519" end="00:36:20.059" style="s2">chest it&#39;s just empty words or they get</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.819" end="00:36:23.779" style="s2">all of the stuff we&#39;re critical all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.059" end="00:36:26.180" style="s2">you know the the willful assertion</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.779" end="00:36:28.460" style="s2">magical thinking senses of how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.180" end="00:36:30.799" style="s2">misappropriate the sometimes that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.460" end="00:36:33.049" style="s2">for me where this is the knife-edge</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.799" end="00:36:34.849" style="s2">question that&#39;s coming down how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.049" end="00:36:36.859" style="s2">what do we give to people how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.849" end="00:36:39.319" style="s2">adduce how do we draw forth from them</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.859" end="00:36:41.329" style="s2">this capacity for this kind of faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.319" end="00:36:44.150" style="s2">where what I mean by faith is to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.329" end="00:36:46.700" style="s2">caught up in the the terrible beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.150" end="00:36:49.039" style="s2">this symbol so that one is called to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.700" end="00:36:50.869" style="s2">one&#39;s depth and one is drawn out</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.039" end="00:36:52.910" style="s2">aspirationally into the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.869" end="00:36:55.009" style="s2">world so that one can confront the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.910" end="00:36:57.410" style="s2">deepest things with the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.009" end="00:36:59.660" style="s2">resources at ones disposal that for me</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.410" end="00:37:02.329" style="s2">is the central question that I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.660" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">well that&#39;s forgive me Zack that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.329" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">I saw the paper as really driving</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:12.520" style="s2">towards at the end</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:15.820" style="s2">no no that&#39;s such a good question such a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.520" end="00:37:18.760" style="s2">good set of questions right cuz it&#39;s cuz</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.820" end="00:37:19.630" style="s2">this is what what&#39;s the termite pearls</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.760" end="00:37:22.990" style="s2">before swine</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.630" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s like and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.990" end="00:37:28.330" style="s2">classic educational problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:32.580" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a depth to</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.330" end="00:37:35.230" style="s2">like a you know an ancient text which</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.580" end="00:37:37.210" style="s2">you know you wonder the level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.230" end="00:37:39.400" style="s2">maturity of the reader that&#39;s needed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.210" end="00:37:42.130" style="s2">actually perceive the depth and so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.400" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">get what are the prerequisites in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.130" end="00:37:47.220" style="s2">personality and character structure and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:53.130" style="s2">cognition and other things to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.220" end="00:37:53.130" style="s2">receive the symbol that&#39;s there and -</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.160" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a that&#39;s the well</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.100" end="00:38:04.020" style="s2">there&#39;s two things I distantly come to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:07.180" style="s2">mind you know one is experiences</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.020" end="00:38:09.220" style="s2">formative experiences where the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.180" end="00:38:13.930" style="s2">symbol or comparable symbols or</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.220" end="00:38:16.840" style="s2">modalities of expression were terrible</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.930" end="00:38:20.830" style="s2">for you right so many of the people I</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.840" end="00:38:22.690" style="s2">know who find it hard to be receptive to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.830" end="00:38:25.210" style="s2">the language in an article like to my</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.690" end="00:38:26.440" style="s2">Road you know had and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.210" end="00:38:29.080" style="s2">mentioned this last time we spoke John</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.440" end="00:38:32.050" style="s2">they had bad experiences in their in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.080" end="00:38:34.180" style="s2">their youth right yeah a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.050" end="00:38:38.770" style="s2">of yeah that happened to use</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.180" end="00:38:41.170" style="s2">this kind of simple thing and so so</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.770" end="00:38:42.550" style="s2">that&#39;s one major important element there</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.170" end="00:38:46.390" style="s2">which is that like this stuff&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.550" end="00:38:48.430" style="s2">given a bad name you know and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.390" end="00:38:52.660" style="s2">way that it&#39;s like the wells been</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.430" end="00:38:54.730" style="s2">poisoned and so how do we make it clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.660" end="00:38:57.400" style="s2">that we&#39;re drawing from a clear spring</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.730" end="00:39:00.340" style="s2">that it&#39;s a different source and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.400" end="00:39:02.290" style="s2">that&#39;s why many people leave there they</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.340" end="00:39:04.570" style="s2">go to the yeast right door they go from</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.290" end="00:39:08.260" style="s2">the east to the west and depending on</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.570" end="00:39:10.210" style="s2">where you&#39;re where you&#39;re from so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.260" end="00:39:11.530" style="s2">I think one component so there&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.210" end="00:39:15.850" style="s2">of it which means it&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.530" end="00:39:18.420" style="s2">like either making them explicit I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.850" end="00:39:18.420" style="s2">working it through</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.270" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2">or finding a novelty a real novelty than</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.200" end="00:39:28.190" style="s2">the way the things are expressed so</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:31.520" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the issue there other than</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.190" end="00:39:34.579" style="s2">the other the other component that came</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:37.329" style="s2">to mind has to do with element of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.579" end="00:39:39.650" style="s2">practice and modeling yeah which is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.329" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">have you ever seen someone in your</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.650" end="00:39:45.400" style="s2">actual presence do that then right have</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:49.579" style="s2">you experienced an elder or a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.400" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">truly being inspired by ideas and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.579" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">think John this is why your work is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:56.780" style="s2">magnetic right because you&#39;re modeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:58.579" style="s2">for people what it&#39;s like to do what</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.780" end="00:40:00.049" style="s2">you&#39;re asking them to do you&#39;re showing</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.579" end="00:40:02.420" style="s2">that like this is what it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.049" end="00:40:04.670" style="s2">taken into the matrix of the symbol and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.420" end="00:40:07.240" style="s2">live in it and and work with it the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.670" end="00:40:10.069" style="s2">power that comes from that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.240" end="00:40:13.490" style="s2">faith in the life of ideas and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.069" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">of thing so another thing that is clear</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.490" end="00:40:17.420" style="s2">that when people see it when they</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:20.690" style="s2">actually see it they knit is magnetic</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.420" end="00:40:22.190" style="s2">and people move towards that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.690" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">question of which points in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.190" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">and especially formative phases of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:30.799" style="s2">adolescent identity formation and an</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:32.329" style="s2">adult like these key phases who or the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.799" end="00:40:35.690" style="s2">different spokespeople there for these</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.329" end="00:40:38.510" style="s2">things and are they getting at the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.690" end="00:40:41.470" style="s2">times such that when they need it</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.510" end="00:40:45.109" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to turn to it yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.470" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">solace and and the final one I think is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.109" end="00:40:48.950" style="s2">really that this notion of practice just</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:54.710" style="s2">a little bit deeper which is that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.950" end="00:40:59.329" style="s2">takes sustained attention to reap the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.710" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">rewards of this kind of emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.329" end="00:41:05.079" style="s2">identity configuration so to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:07.460" style="s2">that we are becoming as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.079" end="00:41:09.020" style="s2">systemically fragmented in our attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.460" end="00:41:14.059" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be hard for us to actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.020" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">sustain the focus to have a complex</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.059" end="00:41:18.349" style="s2">enough relationship to the symbol and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:21.349" style="s2">the accompanying kind of like Semantic</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.349" end="00:41:24.049" style="s2">Web to get to get drawn in and to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.349" end="00:41:25.819" style="s2">empowered I am again so so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.049" end="00:41:28.099" style="s2">key and that&#39;s not just about meditation</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.819" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">it&#39;s about long-form books and other</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.099" end="00:41:31.089" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:34.030" style="s2">defragment the attention and allow you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.089" end="00:41:37.060" style="s2">to walk you just read for two hours</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.030" end="00:41:39.640" style="s2">almost straight now you&#39;re so deep in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.060" end="00:41:42.609" style="s2">the language that when it starts to move</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.640" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">with symbolism you can actually get the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.609" end="00:41:48.390" style="s2">full range of connotations that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:51.430" style="s2">implied instead of the soundbite like</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.390" end="00:41:53.500" style="s2">tweet version right and anything that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.500" end="00:41:59.530" style="s2">gonna end up having that symbolic depth</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.380" end="00:42:01.150" style="s2">and richness that is necessary so so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.530" end="00:42:03.460" style="s2">that&#39;s another component I think in</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.150" end="00:42:06.490" style="s2">terms of the kind of pedagogical look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.460" end="00:42:12.339" style="s2">just how can we do this and make people</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.490" end="00:42:13.630" style="s2">more susceptible to head to these</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.339" end="00:42:14.910" style="s2">resources that they were in that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.630" end="00:42:17.829" style="s2">become available</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.910" end="00:42:22.300" style="s2">just just one thing I&#39;d like to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.829" end="00:42:24.250" style="s2">add to that it seems to me that in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.300" end="00:42:25.810" style="s2">present crisis that we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.250" end="00:42:30.069" style="s2">and also just to bring it back to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.810" end="00:42:31.990" style="s2">crisis our reaction to the crisis sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.069" end="00:42:34.630" style="s2">of depends on how deeply we have studied</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.990" end="00:42:38.380" style="s2">these these things or how deeply we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.630" end="00:42:40.630" style="s2">studied life and if we&#39;ve studied them</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.380" end="00:42:43.540" style="s2">deeply we know that there&#39;s a crisis all</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.630" end="00:42:46.569" style="s2">the time right this is not this is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.540" end="00:42:48.609" style="s2">exceptional crisis in one sense but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.569" end="00:42:50.109" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re all gonna die is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.609" end="00:42:52.589" style="s2">like that&#39;s like the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.109" end="00:42:55.960" style="s2">learn right and if you study any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.589" end="00:42:57.880" style="s2">religious tradition is to contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.960" end="00:43:00.310" style="s2">the fact that there&#39;s a crisis going on</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.880" end="00:43:01.770" style="s2">all the time just by virtue of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.310" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">that we have bodies that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.770" end="00:43:11.230" style="s2">disintegrating and we have to live that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:13.450" style="s2">tragedy yeah I think that&#39;s right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.230" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">I think I think it was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.450" end="00:43:19.030" style="s2">talking with Peter limber again his</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:20.980" style="s2">online stoah about and I want to connect</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.030" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">this to Zak&#39;s point about long-form</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.980" end="00:43:24.970" style="s2">attention because I think deal logos and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:27.329" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing here is also a great</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.970" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">exemplification of that long-form</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.329" end="00:43:34.030" style="s2">attention that is deeply enmeshed with</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:35.740" style="s2">trying to draw forth you know a new</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.030" end="00:43:37.630" style="s2">fountain intelligibility from all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.740" end="00:43:39.400" style="s2">these hidden semantic and conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.630" end="00:43:41.619" style="s2">resources so I think that&#39;s why idea the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.400" end="00:43:43.089" style="s2">logos is actually crucial and the logos</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.619" end="00:43:45.249" style="s2">is not just</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.089" end="00:43:47.890" style="s2">presentation of idea the logos is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.249" end="00:43:50.200" style="s2">exemplification as accent all the way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.890" end="00:43:51.999" style="s2">life and how it is actually viable for</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.200" end="00:43:54.969" style="s2">people being enacted right here right</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.999" end="00:43:58.769" style="s2">now I think what I wanted to say about</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.969" end="00:44:02.229" style="s2">you the point you made Andrew is</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.769" end="00:44:06.249" style="s2">connected to this long-form practice you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.229" end="00:44:08.109" style="s2">know that it&#39;s it&#39;s um so stoicism one</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.249" end="00:44:10.869" style="s2">way Visser does this and beyond faith</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.109" end="00:44:12.549" style="s2">you know that our word fatal which we</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.869" end="00:44:15.039" style="s2">attack we we don&#39;t we now equate with</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.549" end="00:44:17.289" style="s2">causing death that&#39;s not its origin his</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.039" end="00:44:19.390" style="s2">origin is having to do with fate which</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.289" end="00:44:21.609" style="s2">is the way in which reality acts beyond</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.390" end="00:44:23.769" style="s2">all of our ego centric projects and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.609" end="00:44:26.229" style="s2">concerns in the way which we can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.769" end="00:44:27.729" style="s2">struck by absurdity or tragedy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.229" end="00:44:30.519" style="s2">many different ways in which reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.729" end="00:44:31.779" style="s2">hits us in the face and says aha you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.519" end="00:44:33.940" style="s2">have all your projects and all your</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.779" end="00:44:37.269" style="s2">narcissistic narrative but look</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.940" end="00:44:39.789" style="s2">Here I am right and so yeah there why</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.269" end="00:44:42.249" style="s2">the associate EK most wrong right is of</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.789" end="00:44:44.049" style="s2">course the event of death is the most in</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.249" end="00:44:47.469" style="s2">that sense fatal it&#39;s the one that makes</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.049" end="00:44:49.539" style="s2">us most aware of how reality is involved</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.469" end="00:44:51.130" style="s2">and beyond us but then the point is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.539" end="00:44:53.739" style="s2">and I think this is what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.130" end="00:44:56.499" style="s2">and ER the point is not to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.739" end="00:44:58.210" style="s2">considerate just considerate of the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.499" end="00:45:00.460" style="s2">fact that our existence will terminate</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.210" end="00:45:02.799" style="s2">it&#39;s that right here right now we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.460" end="00:45:05.130" style="s2">meshed in fatality and the mortality of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.799" end="00:45:08.710" style="s2">all things because always always</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.130" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">everything is threatening us in the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.710" end="00:45:14.049" style="s2">that it is always beyond our narrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:16.390" style="s2">and are narcissistic narrative and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.049" end="00:45:18.279" style="s2">had up we&#39;ve we&#39;re going into a culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.390" end="00:45:20.229" style="s2">that is doubling down and trying to sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.279" end="00:45:22.420" style="s2">of no no no no I can just make it so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.229" end="00:45:24.039" style="s2">can just make it so by speaking it more</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.420" end="00:45:25.089" style="s2">loudly and getting other people to show</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.039" end="00:45:28.630" style="s2">it with me</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.089" end="00:45:31.630" style="s2">and so I think that gives us that&#39;s back</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.630" end="00:45:33.279" style="s2">again and I&#39;m not trying to like Dragoon</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.630" end="00:45:37.839" style="s2">something but I think that&#39;s again this</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.279" end="00:45:41.170" style="s2">sense of sacredness of sacredness is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.839" end="00:45:43.089" style="s2">be at home with right at home with your</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.170" end="00:45:46.599" style="s2">mortality and the fatality of all things</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.089" end="00:45:48.599" style="s2">while never denying it&#39;s real horror the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.599" end="00:45:52.239" style="s2">fact that it can always it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.599" end="00:45:55.980" style="s2">every moment capable of showing you in</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.239" end="00:45:57.690" style="s2">absurdity or in horror</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.980" end="00:46:00.510" style="s2">or in what&#39;s happened you know in terror</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.690" end="00:46:04.040" style="s2">or in all kinds of things that reality</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.510" end="00:46:07.770" style="s2">is something that is always always</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.040" end="00:46:09.540" style="s2">always and you know not always just in</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.770" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">the long term but always always here and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.540" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">now beyond us in very very powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:18.330" style="s2">and so stoicism was a lot about trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:20.609" style="s2">to we order yet and right and and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.330" end="00:46:21.810" style="s2">think socialism as a clear example comes</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.609" end="00:46:23.430" style="s2">out of the Socratic tradition very</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.810" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">clearly in which people were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.430" end="00:46:27.960" style="s2">Wed Socratic rationality with this kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:30.180" style="s2">of faith</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.960" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">stoicism has been called a religion and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.180" end="00:46:34.680" style="s2">I think not unfairly because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:36.930" style="s2">in which you tried to get people right a</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.680" end="00:46:39.660" style="s2">new sense of the sacred that allowed</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.930" end="00:46:43.230" style="s2">them right to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.660" end="00:46:44.700" style="s2">moment-by-moment fatality of all things</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.230" end="00:46:46.200" style="s2">I think the good is amiss probably do</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.700" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">something very similar which is why</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.200" end="00:46:51.210" style="s2">there&#39;s often comparisons drawn between</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:53.310" style="s2">stoicism and Buddhism by the way so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.210" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s really really important what</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.310" end="00:46:58.770" style="s2">Andrew just said and connect it to what</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.890" end="00:46:59.820" style="s2">Zacks said and I think what connects</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.770" end="00:47:03.300" style="s2">them is this whole thing we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.820" end="00:47:06.119" style="s2">talking about this this sense this lived</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.300" end="00:47:12.150" style="s2">viable aspirational sense of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.119" end="00:47:15.240" style="s2">right here right now great and just</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.150" end="00:47:17.160" style="s2">maybe after we&#39;ve said all that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.240" end="00:47:20.300" style="s2">talked about that this is being the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.160" end="00:47:23.840" style="s2">state that we&#39;re in or all the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.300" end="00:47:26.700" style="s2">maybe I want maybe we could move to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.840" end="00:47:28.500" style="s2">speak about what you called you call</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.700" end="00:47:30.990" style="s2">something great on patterning or</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.500" end="00:47:35.640" style="s2">transition or what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.990" end="00:47:36.600" style="s2">now and I don&#39;t mean about the virus in</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.640" end="00:47:39.780" style="s2">any literal sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.600" end="00:47:42.320" style="s2">I mean what&#39;s what&#39;s I mean yes literal</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.780" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">because it is a literal thing but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.320" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">what&#39;s going on now what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:51.270" style="s2">time because you talk about historicity</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:54.050" style="s2">I think Zack and and and the importance</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.270" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">of that and the importance of time and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.050" end="00:48:03.859" style="s2">is my question clear it is and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:03.859" style="s2">mean fate is unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.030" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re in kind of sacred Kairos right</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.089" end="00:48:13.970" style="s2">where reality is where reality is</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:18.020" style="s2">appearing kind of again as it were</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">because of our the deep simulations that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.020" end="00:48:22.550" style="s2">were produced by the civilization as it</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:24.829" style="s2">was moving through where we thought that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.550" end="00:48:26.869" style="s2">we didn&#39;t need to have massive supplies</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.829" end="00:48:29.180" style="s2">back loaded in hospitals just in case</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.869" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">there was a Mike we didn&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.180" end="00:48:35.300" style="s2">through right because we were deep in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.520" end="00:48:38.440" style="s2">simulation and everything was fine and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.300" end="00:48:41.930" style="s2">so now yeah we are confronting reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.440" end="00:48:44.930" style="s2">and so the question is yeah will we will</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.930" end="00:48:49.609" style="s2">we pull together like Stoics and love</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.930" end="00:48:52.460" style="s2">fate and end up in crazy and and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.609" end="00:48:55.579" style="s2">moving with our identities to become to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.460" end="00:48:59.000" style="s2">become one with the tragic situation</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.579" end="00:49:02.599" style="s2">then transform it somehow from the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.000" end="00:49:05.690" style="s2">inside in response to it and so that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.599" end="00:49:07.070" style="s2">see mostly what&#39;s unfolding now and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.690" end="00:49:08.780" style="s2">that&#39;s why I talked about a war in</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.070" end="00:49:12.290" style="s2">heaven is that Jude&#39;s choice it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.780" end="00:49:16.010" style="s2">the basis of choice and who are we</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.290" end="00:49:19.130" style="s2">choosing to be and so that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.010" end="00:49:22.849" style="s2">conflict between these ideals we have of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.130" end="00:49:27.410" style="s2">ourselves right are we stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.849" end="00:49:29.240" style="s2">that so what is the war of heaven</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.410" end="00:49:33.650" style="s2">between who and who is it between the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.240" end="00:49:35.660" style="s2">knee list and let&#39;s say the the life</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.650" end="00:49:38.060" style="s2">hater and the life giver I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.660" end="00:49:39.740" style="s2">what is the war what is it&#39;s me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.060" end="00:49:41.210" style="s2">Matt it&#39;s massively complicated right</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.740" end="00:49:43.940" style="s2">you remember last time we spoke it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.210" end="00:49:45.890" style="s2">this sense of the divine double and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.940" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">we kind of brought home one and the room</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.890" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">was like no it&#39;s actually there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:52.550" style="s2">of those potential selves that are in</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:55.099" style="s2">your arc typical imagination to move</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.550" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">towards us like personal ideals yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.099" end="00:49:57.980" style="s2">so what&#39;s happened now with the great on</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">patterning is that everyone&#39;s sitting at</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.980" end="00:50:04.910" style="s2">home with a lot of time were an absence</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:07.160" style="s2">of time so a fragmentation of conti the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.910" end="00:50:09.050" style="s2">way you&#39;re hanging out with many many of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.160" end="00:50:09.770" style="s2">yourselves who usually don&#39;t get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.050" end="00:50:11.240" style="s2">of airtime</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.770" end="00:50:12.710" style="s2">right so there&#39;s many of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.240" end="00:50:14.220" style="s2">archetypal personalities and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.710" end="00:50:16.770" style="s2">possibilities for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.220" end="00:50:19.650" style="s2">are now flooding the imagination into</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.770" end="00:50:21.780" style="s2">this opening from being unpadded and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.650" end="00:50:23.970" style="s2">it happens when you travel it happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.780" end="00:50:26.100" style="s2">other times in your day-to-day life when</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.970" end="00:50:27.390" style="s2">something like if you went for an</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.100" end="00:50:28.890" style="s2">appointment that didn&#39;t happen and now</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.390" end="00:50:30.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like an hour to just sit</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.890" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">there and you don&#39;t have your phone or</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.120" end="00:50:33.390" style="s2">something like what happened your</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:33.810" style="s2">imagination goes unless you&#39;re a Penn</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.390" end="00:50:36.330" style="s2">Stater</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.810" end="00:50:38.700" style="s2">right like so there&#39;s the war in heaven</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.330" end="00:50:41.460" style="s2">is that it&#39;s this is a universal version</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.700" end="00:50:44.460" style="s2">of that of like being in the doctor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.460" end="00:50:46.280" style="s2">office you know waiting for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.460" end="00:50:49.170" style="s2">appointment and then what happens right</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.280" end="00:50:50.520" style="s2">right and what happens in the doctor day</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.170" end="00:50:52.380" style="s2">we&#39;re waiting for the appointment in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.520" end="00:50:54.570" style="s2">doctor&#39;s office were nervous there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.380" end="00:50:56.640" style="s2">good magazines we&#39;re sitting there and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.570" end="00:50:58.590" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these different possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.640" end="00:51:01.020" style="s2">cells that were thinking about them</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.590" end="00:51:03.780" style="s2">because the way the world will be on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.020" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">other side of this is also unclear it</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.780" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">means that we&#39;re getting in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:11.880" style="s2">all of all ourselves the full range</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:14.190" style="s2">right shadow and light if I can use that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:16.620" style="s2">kind of polarization so it&#39;s not a war</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.190" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">between two forces it&#39;s a war between</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.620" end="00:51:20.580" style="s2">the many potent possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:23.340" style="s2">ourselves that we&#39;re going to actualize</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.580" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">through really unique moments of choice</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.340" end="00:51:29.700" style="s2">in the coming months right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">about that so who do we choose to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.700" end="00:51:37.290" style="s2">when we make a choice and and so again</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.760" end="00:51:39.600" style="s2">it means we have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.290" end="00:51:41.460" style="s2">become incredible people right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.600" end="00:51:45.300" style="s2">one possibility we have the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.460" end="00:51:48.150" style="s2">to be integral and to act with character</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.300" end="00:51:50.190" style="s2">and integrity and to know the principles</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.150" end="00:51:53.850" style="s2">that we want to live by and to live by</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.190" end="00:51:57.390" style="s2">them more so now than ever because you</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.850" end="00:51:59.250" style="s2">know rehearsals over these on time and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.390" end="00:52:01.770" style="s2">we have space are they yeah these are</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.250" end="00:52:04.620" style="s2">the important choices so we have that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.770" end="00:52:07.140" style="s2">possibility which is rare actually to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.620" end="00:52:09.540" style="s2">in a moment of historical gravitas where</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.140" end="00:52:12.840" style="s2">you have the chance to be doing really</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.540" end="00:52:15.980" style="s2">the right thing so but we also have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.840" end="00:52:20.030" style="s2">opportunity to descend into</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.980" end="00:52:22.730" style="s2">ass and through fragmentation of choice</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.030" end="00:52:24.700" style="s2">and being many different people not</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.730" end="00:52:27.560" style="s2">holding together with integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.700" end="00:52:31.220" style="s2">catering to those voices that are most</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.560" end="00:52:33.160" style="s2">selfish and most fear driven etc so</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.220" end="00:52:36.230" style="s2">that&#39;s that balance that battle in our</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.160" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">personalities basically as we&#39;re faced</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.230" end="00:52:41.630" style="s2">with decisions we never thought we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:44.090" style="s2">have to make in choices goods is that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.630" end="00:52:49.130" style="s2">never even kind of thought were on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.090" end="00:52:52.190" style="s2">table or now on the table so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.130" end="00:52:54.890" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of how you know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.190" end="00:52:57.550" style="s2">how I&#39;m feeling it so the title of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.890" end="00:53:00.680" style="s2">Tillich&#39;s book the courage to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.550" end="00:53:03.770" style="s2">middle mind when you say that when we</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.680" end="00:53:06.530" style="s2">mmm-hmm it was very clear about is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.770" end="00:53:08.240" style="s2">required a transformation right in faith</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.530" end="00:53:09.800" style="s2">and a transformation in the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:12.680" style="s2">God you had to get to the God beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.800" end="00:53:15.619" style="s2">God of theism we had to let the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.680" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">change which is part of what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.619" end="00:53:23.000" style="s2">bring that you know the the ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.720" end="00:53:27.800" style="s2">you know they&#39;re part of what this means</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.000" end="00:53:31.040" style="s2">is is a participatory stance not not</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.800" end="00:53:33.290" style="s2">neither you know you know a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:35.270" style="s2">passive stance or an assertive stance</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.290" end="00:53:37.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a participatory stance we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.270" end="00:53:40.250" style="s2">participate in this because we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.790" end="00:53:42.020" style="s2">be willing to let the symbols change too</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.250" end="00:53:44.630" style="s2">and I think that was a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.020" end="00:53:48.440" style="s2">message and and faith isn&#39;t the holding</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.630" end="00:53:52.100" style="s2">on of to the existing symbol for Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.440" end="00:53:56.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s cert and it&#39;s not any premature</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.100" end="00:54:01.960" style="s2">closure right oh now I have it right</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.180" end="00:54:04.730" style="s2">it&#39;s instead but it&#39;s the vector off the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.960" end="00:54:06.920" style="s2">Hebrew word right it&#39;s like the way you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.730" end="00:54:10.460" style="s2">have the way you&#39;re faithful to your</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.920" end="00:54:12.320" style="s2">partner is not hold her that&#39;s why speak</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.460" end="00:54:14.030" style="s2">I&#39;m straight so I&#39;m just using myself as</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.320" end="00:54:16.130" style="s2">an example not to hold her now you</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.030" end="00:54:18.740" style="s2">always have to be this way or you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.130" end="00:54:20.420" style="s2">this here&#39;s a particular symbol I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.740" end="00:54:22.490" style="s2">created for a relationship and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.420" end="00:54:24.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not up for negotiation that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.490" end="00:54:26.119" style="s2">like no that&#39;s not what it means it</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.380" end="00:54:28.700" style="s2">means you have to be willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.119" end="00:54:29.580" style="s2">involved and let yourself change as the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.700" end="00:54:31.860" style="s2">symbol change</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.580" end="00:54:33.630" style="s2">so that you made it make maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.860" end="00:54:35.580" style="s2">continuity of contact about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.630" end="00:54:37.140" style="s2">and that brings me up to a concern with</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.580" end="00:54:38.790" style="s2">what not with what Zack said because I</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.140" end="00:54:40.230" style="s2">think what he said but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.790" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">an extra dimension to the war in heaven</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.230" end="00:54:45.210" style="s2">and you know Chris and I our work are</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:47.550" style="s2">thinking about this and this also goes</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.210" end="00:54:49.310" style="s2">to work that your your your harness is</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.550" end="00:54:52.110" style="s2">talking about need hauser</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.310" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">the fact that many people when they and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.110" end="00:54:55.830" style="s2">Hahn talks about this too right when</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:59.580" style="s2">people are throwing into this empty time</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.830" end="00:55:01.620" style="s2">right they have and I&#39;m trying not to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.580" end="00:55:03.420" style="s2">insulting here but this is sort of a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.620" end="00:55:06.660" style="s2">of getting the gist of they have a kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.420" end="00:55:08.940" style="s2">of shallowness in imagination if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.660" end="00:55:10.650" style="s2">allow me to use Corbin&#39;s idea they have</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.940" end="00:55:12.780" style="s2">a merely imaginary sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.650" end="00:55:15.810" style="s2">imagination not an imaginal they have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.780" end="00:55:18.480" style="s2">purely subjective sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.810" end="00:55:20.790" style="s2">imagination not a trans jacket one and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:23.220" style="s2">therefore it cuts them off in the very</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.790" end="00:55:26.280" style="s2">way they have been in cultured to deal</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.220" end="00:55:28.620" style="s2">with their imagination right it cuts</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.620" end="00:55:33.960" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about here and so my</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.080" end="00:55:37.650" style="s2">concern is that they you know are sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.960" end="00:55:40.560" style="s2">of Cartesian the subjectivity is being</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.650" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">challenged really dramatically here but</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.560" end="00:55:46.830" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned that people in order to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:49.050" style="s2">let the symbol in order to grow with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.830" end="00:55:51.870" style="s2">symbol as it grows you have to have an</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.050" end="00:55:54.810" style="s2">imaginal sense of the symbol not a</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.870" end="00:55:57.960" style="s2">merely imaginary sense of it but the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.810" end="00:56:00.750" style="s2">symbol and the image doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.960" end="00:56:03.360" style="s2">your head space that&#39;s not ready</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.750" end="00:56:05.130" style="s2">fundamentally between you and the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.360" end="00:56:08.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a joining of you to something</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.130" end="00:56:09.960" style="s2">deeply other than you and that means you</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.130" end="00:56:12.180" style="s2">only know you&#39;re going to it when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.960" end="00:56:14.850" style="s2">actually transforming you and changing</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.180" end="00:56:18.120" style="s2">you and that means transforming how it</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.850" end="00:56:21.000" style="s2">appears and shines into you and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.120" end="00:56:27.650" style="s2">so my concern to put it in a phrases</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.000" end="00:56:30.630" style="s2">right do we have the proper you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.650" end="00:56:34.680" style="s2">training in the imaginal that will</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.630" end="00:56:37.830" style="s2">afford us you know appropriating this</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.680" end="00:56:39.300" style="s2">Kairos in the right way that&#39;s sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.830" end="00:56:41.250" style="s2">keep circling back to this because this</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.300" end="00:56:43.760" style="s2">I mean this is sort of my Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.250" end="00:56:45.500" style="s2">concern it&#39;s like I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.760" end="00:56:48.740" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to act as midwife what</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.500" end="00:56:53.390" style="s2">midwives but I think there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.740" end="00:56:57.020" style="s2">tremendous difficulties in the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.390" end="00:56:59.840" style="s2">of our thought and discourse that</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.020" end="00:57:02.540" style="s2">prevent us from tapping those semantic</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.540" end="00:57:07.730" style="s2">think Tillich we&#39;re trying to put their</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.400" end="00:57:10.220" style="s2">finger up and that&#39;s why Zach&#39;s idea of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.730" end="00:57:12.290" style="s2">a total revolution of education is so</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.220" end="00:57:14.900" style="s2">important I think I think that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.290" end="00:57:17.810" style="s2">that that has I&#39;m trying to strengthen</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.900" end="00:57:23.180" style="s2">the case for that point yeah unless</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.810" end="00:57:26.630" style="s2">unless like any purely individualistic</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.630" end="00:57:31.340" style="s2">home I look like of course people have</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.790" end="00:57:34.520" style="s2">to do that and I&#39;m not you know but if</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.340" end="00:57:38.060" style="s2">if if there&#39;s any sense in which that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.060" end="00:57:42.290" style="s2">way and is firing our way through this</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.040" end="00:57:44.750" style="s2">Kairos that has to be really challenged</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.290" end="00:57:46.850" style="s2">and I think I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.750" end="00:57:50.420" style="s2">put an argument in here that actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.850" end="00:57:53.120" style="s2">strengthens Zach&#39;s point yeah radical</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.420" end="00:57:55.370" style="s2">right transformation is needed to our</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.120" end="00:57:57.170" style="s2">educational system where you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.370" end="00:57:58.550" style="s2">it&#39;s the line between education and an</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.170" end="00:58:00.920" style="s2">acculturation is completely being</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.550" end="00:58:03.110" style="s2">blurred it seems to me and what zach is</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.920" end="00:58:06.050" style="s2">proposing and we&#39;ve got to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.110" end="00:58:08.600" style="s2">that unique powerful way you know just</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.050" end="00:58:11.360" style="s2">before Zach you respond I I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.600" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">about the fact that when you paint that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.360" end="00:58:17.630" style="s2">picture John it looks very very grim but</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">at the same time at the same time it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.630" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">grim and it is a grim picture at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:26.050" style="s2">same time maybe a few individuals doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:30.620" style="s2">this properly can go a long way right</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.050" end="00:58:32.840" style="s2">and so I think of it again I think in</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.620" end="00:58:35.120" style="s2">the biblical Ark story are like building</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.840" end="00:58:37.940" style="s2">an ark or just you know building the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.120" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">thing doing the thing properly now just</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.940" end="00:58:44.990" style="s2">a few people can can save save the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:47.060" style="s2">if I can be as she&#39;s right yeah no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.990" end="00:58:50.990" style="s2">not it&#39;s not cheesy I never understood</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.060" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">the etymology of that insult I love</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.990" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">cheese ever Fred&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.650" end="00:59:02.349" style="s2">and the weapons and he&#39;s the gadfly for</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.319" end="00:59:04.299" style="s2">the entire place right and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.349" end="00:59:06.910" style="s2">all these movements start up around him</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.299" end="00:59:08.500" style="s2">and all the socratic low guy you know of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.910" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">the all that you wish it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.500" end="00:59:12.250" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:13.510" style="s2">Leonard Cohen II it&#39;s like he sank</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.250" end="00:59:15.730" style="s2">beneath your wisdom like a stone</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.510" end="00:59:18.490" style="s2">although he was Jesus but all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.730" end="00:59:20.680" style="s2">ripples just spread out in like and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.490" end="00:59:24.220" style="s2">was deeply deep and eventually it leads</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.680" end="00:59:28.900" style="s2">to stoicism and Marcus Aurelius right we</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.220" end="00:59:30.849" style="s2">I yes I do want to sorry exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.900" end="00:59:32.349" style="s2">commending you from speaking but I just</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.849" end="00:59:34.240" style="s2">want to pick up on although in painting</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.349" end="00:59:36.789" style="s2">a grim picture I keep holding out the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.240" end="00:59:39.270" style="s2">these exemplary figures and how in</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.789" end="00:59:44.049" style="s2">situations very very similar to ours</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.270" end="00:59:46.869" style="s2">they were able to enact and afford that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.049" end="00:59:49.539" style="s2">kind of educational enculturation &#39;el</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.869" end="00:59:51.490" style="s2">reform that zach is pointing to so this</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.539" end="00:59:54.190" style="s2">is this is not in an event it&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.490" end="00:59:56.589" style="s2">not an inevitable reminisce of doom or a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.190" end="00:59:58.150" style="s2">grimness of inevitable doom that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.589" end="01:00:00.039" style="s2">what I&#39;m arguing for at all I&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.150" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">for taking it very seriously but</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.039" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">pointing out there&#39;s real historical</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:09.339" style="s2">examples of ways in which this can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:11.049" style="s2">seen through right I think you know and</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.339" end="01:00:13.930" style="s2">I mean I completely agree of course that</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.049" end="01:00:16.210" style="s2">that the route here is something like</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.930" end="01:00:18.549" style="s2">education extremely broadly construed or</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.210" end="01:00:20.079" style="s2">there the word idea which is the word I</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.549" end="01:00:21.640" style="s2">used in my book which is a word that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.079" end="01:00:23.260" style="s2">basically roughly means like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.640" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">intergenerational transmission that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.260" end="01:00:30.299" style="s2">keeps a polity together yeah so and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:32.829" style="s2">is sorely lacking</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.299" end="01:00:35.109" style="s2">thanks to like the exhaustion of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.829" end="01:00:36.869" style="s2">modern school systems and now those</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.109" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">school systems have been shut off</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.869" end="01:00:43.599" style="s2">basically all around the world and all</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:46.020" style="s2">of the kids are at home and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.599" end="01:00:50.529" style="s2">really an unprecedented situation</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.020" end="01:00:53.410" style="s2">educationally and you know the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.529" end="01:00:55.089" style="s2">of in what ways after this could we</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.410" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">change education so that a situation</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.089" end="01:01:01.210" style="s2">like this doesn&#39;t occur again is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.480" end="01:01:04.630" style="s2">question that I&#39;m asking because so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.210" end="01:01:07.210" style="s2">of the situation with kind of breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.630" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">of anything like a public sphere and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.210" end="01:01:11.190" style="s2">kind of polarization</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:14.759" style="s2">strewth culture and much of this also</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.190" end="01:01:20.069" style="s2">rooted in the educational crisis broadly</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.759" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">construed so yeah and enculturation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.069" end="01:01:24.660" style="s2">schooling were basically separated and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:25.349" style="s2">then we forgot to work on inculturation</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.660" end="01:01:27.690" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.349" end="01:01:30.049" style="s2">and we taught kids a bunch of technical</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.690" end="01:01:32.789" style="s2">skills to try to prepare them for jobs</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.049" end="01:01:34.440" style="s2">early in modernity that was okay because</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.789" end="01:01:36.359" style="s2">the churches were still going and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.440" end="01:01:38.309" style="s2">convenience we&#39;re still going and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.359" end="01:01:40.109" style="s2">system hadn&#39;t basically colonized the</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.309" end="01:01:41.549" style="s2">life world to the extent that the dinner</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.109" end="01:01:45.539" style="s2">table wasn&#39;t a place of acculturation</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.549" end="01:01:47.339" style="s2">anymore but separating those having</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.539" end="01:01:49.049" style="s2">schooling going strong getting lots of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.339" end="01:01:50.460" style="s2">really technically capacitated people</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.049" end="01:01:52.380" style="s2">through a school system up into some</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.460" end="01:01:55.980" style="s2">extensive meritocracy right and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.380" end="01:01:58.140" style="s2">alongside that lack of rich character</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.980" end="01:02:00.809" style="s2">building inculturation old processes</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.140" end="01:02:03.990" style="s2">right instead something like popular</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.809" end="01:02:07.920" style="s2">culture and consumerism being the main</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.990" end="01:02:09.450" style="s2">modality of toleration and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.920" end="01:02:12.690" style="s2">that&#39;s a nightmare and that&#39;s produced</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.450" end="01:02:17.160" style="s2">the generations now that are in power</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.690" end="01:02:19.259" style="s2">and aspiring to power so yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.160" end="01:02:22.680" style="s2">all of these cascades systematically</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.259" end="01:02:24.660" style="s2">from educational failures and not just</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.680" end="01:02:27.299" style="s2">failures of school and like TV could</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.660" end="01:02:28.440" style="s2">have been different if you read the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.299" end="01:02:31.410" style="s2">early literature in the history of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.440" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">Education when TV was coming out people</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.410" end="01:02:35.339" style="s2">were talking about the way we were</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:37.619" style="s2">talking about the internet in like 1995</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.339" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">or 2000 this is the thing that will save</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.619" end="01:02:41.309" style="s2">democracy and television will do that</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">and like didn&#39;t pan out that way for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.309" end="01:02:45.779" style="s2">number of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:47.519" style="s2">so we failed across the board in using</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.779" end="01:02:49.859" style="s2">the infrastructures and that technology</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.519" end="01:02:53.640" style="s2">is we had to make the Padilla strong</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.859" end="01:02:55.440" style="s2">enough to support the polity and so the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.640" end="01:02:57.480" style="s2">polity is in crisis and were realizing</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.440" end="01:03:00.150" style="s2">the paucity of the pedido</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.480" end="01:03:02.609" style="s2">which means we&#39;re realizing the that</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.150" end="01:03:07.619" style="s2">fourfold educational crisis I broke down</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.609" end="01:03:11.789" style="s2">last time is unfolding so my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.619" end="01:03:14.369" style="s2">that if we move quickly we could in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.789" end="01:03:17.190" style="s2">generation start to change things but it</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.369" end="01:03:18.990" style="s2">would require some of the social</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.190" end="01:03:20.279" style="s2">miracles I&#39;ll I have in my book which</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.990" end="01:03:21.420" style="s2">are on the table now things like basic</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.279" end="01:03:24.450" style="s2">income guarantee</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.420" end="01:03:26.579" style="s2">and adult education right where that</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.450" end="01:03:28.109" style="s2">where we could get a whole group of</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.579" end="01:03:30.869" style="s2">people actually a whole generation of</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.109" end="01:03:33.569" style="s2">like food service workers basically who</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.869" end="01:03:35.240" style="s2">may or may not have jobs to return to we</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.569" end="01:03:40.670" style="s2">could get them into position to become</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.240" end="01:03:43.170" style="s2">more like teachers or community guides</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.670" end="01:03:44.910" style="s2">working in a decentralized educational</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.170" end="01:03:48.260" style="s2">system as opposed to returning them to</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.910" end="01:03:51.869" style="s2">their jobs right but if we just try to</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.260" end="01:03:54.690" style="s2">reboot the schools as we knew them and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.869" end="01:03:56.790" style="s2">kind of go back to the way it was I</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.690" end="01:03:58.890" style="s2">think that&#39;s actually a recipe for</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.790" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">deepening the mental health crisis I</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.890" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna have to basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:05.730" style="s2">address what&#39;s happening with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:08.069" style="s2">immediate reforms of schooling on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.730" end="01:04:09.990" style="s2">other side of it similar to what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.069" end="01:04:13.740" style="s2">have to do after a war transpired like</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.990" end="01:04:15.960" style="s2">yeah we&#39;d have to find a way to help the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.740" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">help the generations make sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.960" end="01:04:21.780" style="s2">together and figure out a shared vision</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:24.210" style="s2">for what it&#39;s like moving forward and</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.780" end="01:04:25.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an educational an</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.210" end="01:04:28.410" style="s2">educational challenge it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.650" end="01:04:30.329" style="s2">more profound ones we&#39;ve faced so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.410" end="01:04:32.640" style="s2">looking at something like as different</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.329" end="01:04:34.530" style="s2">from the schools we&#39;ve had as the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.640" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">schools we have are as different from</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.530" end="01:04:38.760" style="s2">the ones we had before the first world</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">wars right and that difference in</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.760" end="01:04:42.390" style="s2">America at least is profound like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:43.799" style="s2">looking at almost like one room</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.390" end="01:04:47.430" style="s2">schoolhouse stuff for most of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.799" end="01:04:49.740" style="s2">country in 1900s and then in 1950 you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.430" end="01:04:52.140" style="s2">got these huge high schools that were</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.740" end="01:04:54.750" style="s2">basically massive innovations so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.140" end="01:04:57.030" style="s2">suggesting similarly now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.750" end="01:04:58.589" style="s2">mean that much thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.030" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">educational and psychological and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.589" end="01:05:03.530" style="s2">cultural dimensions of this as we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:06.809" style="s2">thinking about you know biometric</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.530" end="01:05:09.540" style="s2">infrastructures and economic stimulus</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.809" end="01:05:11.730" style="s2">packages and geopolitical security and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.540" end="01:05:13.140" style="s2">those things are important but if we</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.730" end="01:05:15.900" style="s2">just pretend that the culture will take</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.140" end="01:05:19.950" style="s2">care of itself and education will be</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.900" end="01:05:21.390" style="s2">fine the way it was then we&#39;ll repeat</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.950" end="01:05:24.380" style="s2">the mistake you may not be exactly</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.390" end="01:05:26.099" style="s2">identical but there will be a breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.380" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">because of the failure of</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.099" end="01:05:31.349" style="s2">intergenerational transmission so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:33.960" style="s2">getting the the massive you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.349" end="01:05:34.730" style="s2">paradigm shift change in education needs</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.960" end="01:05:36.560" style="s2">to happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.730" end="01:05:38.180" style="s2">on one hand and then the other hand the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.560" end="01:05:41.839" style="s2">image he uses that is there is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.180" end="01:05:45.140" style="s2">kitchen table or the you know so I like</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.839" end="01:05:46.849" style="s2">that I think I think getting back to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.140" end="01:05:48.829" style="s2">table and you know I know my daughter is</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.849" end="01:05:51.950" style="s2">home studying and she&#39;s sitting around</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.829" end="01:05:53.930" style="s2">the table doing her school and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.950" end="01:05:57.470" style="s2">wonderful it&#39;s like she&#39;s not corralled</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.930" end="01:06:00.740" style="s2">into the into this sort of alienating</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.470" end="01:06:04.609" style="s2">classroom kind of thing and she&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.740" end="01:06:06.410" style="s2">more relaxed and just as a person person</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.609" end="01:06:08.119" style="s2">person exactly you and you guys are I</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.410" end="01:06:11.180" style="s2">think you&#39;re trying to say the local and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.119" end="01:06:13.070" style="s2">there needs to be a universal change and</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.180" end="01:06:14.810" style="s2">a local change simultaneously oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.070" end="01:06:17.510" style="s2">those are related and you you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.810" end="01:06:19.160" style="s2">you&#39;re lucky like to have a table to sit</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.510" end="01:06:21.710" style="s2">around I know there&#39;s a lot of kids in</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.160" end="01:06:23.810" style="s2">the United States for whom not being</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.710" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">able to go to school is sucks</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.810" end="01:06:27.950" style="s2">yeah the parents are abusive there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:30.140" style="s2">enough room in the house and school was</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.950" end="01:06:32.450" style="s2">actually the safe place for them mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.140" end="01:06:34.040" style="s2">so I&#39;m not like wanting to return it to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.450" end="01:06:36.010" style="s2">the family or even to the local</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.040" end="01:06:38.570" style="s2">community per se because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.010" end="01:06:39.829" style="s2">parochialism that can happen there there</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.570" end="01:06:42.710" style="s2">was something innovative about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.829" end="01:06:45.829" style="s2">universality okay so it&#39;s a hybrid and</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.710" end="01:06:48.109" style="s2">again I expressed it in my book but but</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.829" end="01:06:50.720" style="s2">yeah right now for many people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.109" end="01:06:52.609" style="s2">realizing holy crap like education was</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.720" end="01:06:54.260" style="s2">taken out of the house like education</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.609" end="01:06:55.579" style="s2">was taken from us my kids are taken from</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.260" end="01:06:56.780" style="s2">me everyday like they&#39;re gonna realize</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.579" end="01:06:59.270" style="s2">that when it&#39;s going well and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.780" end="01:07:01.940" style="s2">lucky and the table can be a place where</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.270" end="01:07:04.040" style="s2">love happens in those things there may</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.940" end="01:07:08.089" style="s2">be a realization and some quarters that</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.040" end="01:07:09.380" style="s2">you know Wow many of those patterns that</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.089" end="01:07:10.490" style="s2">have been in place that we take for</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.380" end="01:07:13.910" style="s2">granted almost like they&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.490" end="01:07:17.410" style="s2">nature are in fact not they have been</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.910" end="01:07:22.069" style="s2">constructed and are now changing rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.410" end="01:07:23.650" style="s2">so I do see on the horizon pretty</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.069" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">radical changes in the educational</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.650" end="01:07:31.910" style="s2">possibilities yeah I do because one</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:33.890" style="s2">place where Zach&#39;s notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.910" end="01:07:36.050" style="s2">education crisis and my idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.890" end="01:07:38.119" style="s2">meeting crisis came together of course</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.050" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">was in when I talked about what happens</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.119" end="01:07:41.210" style="s2">after the personal information you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:44.410" style="s2">the separation of the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.210" end="01:07:46.640" style="s2">institution from the wisdom institution</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.410" end="01:07:47.960" style="s2">universities get separated from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.640" end="01:07:49.570" style="s2">monasteries</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.960" end="01:07:51.920" style="s2">and I was gonna say Andrew it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.570" end="01:07:54.770" style="s2">that education was taken I would have</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.920" end="01:07:56.660" style="s2">the the kitchens also taking up to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.770" end="01:07:58.250" style="s2">church I was young enough that I went to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.660" end="01:08:02.900" style="s2">actually went to Sunday school it was</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.250" end="01:08:04.220" style="s2">actually called Sunday school and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.900" end="01:08:07.070" style="s2">and you know and the problem with that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.220" end="01:08:09.170" style="s2">is Sunday school is what is was a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.070" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">degenerate version of what you know what</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.170" end="01:08:13.790" style="s2">the monasteries once were was basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.119" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">indoctrination right and once you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.790" end="01:08:18.739" style="s2">the child sort of to memorize the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:20.420" style="s2">doctrines but even there you saw that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.739" end="01:08:22.759" style="s2">for some people into something and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.420" end="01:08:26.020" style="s2">thinking what the monasteries have been</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.759" end="01:08:29.180" style="s2">and how they are in other cultures like</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.020" end="01:08:35.060" style="s2">you know the Buddhist monastery is not</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.180" end="01:08:36.770" style="s2">separate in the way that it was</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.060" end="01:08:38.509" style="s2">separated from the knowledge institution</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.770" end="01:08:41.000" style="s2">disagreed it is for example in the West</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.509" end="01:08:45.940" style="s2">or something like that so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.000" end="01:08:52.250" style="s2">trying to get at again is this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.940" end="01:08:53.719" style="s2">we not only need to change the but I</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.250" end="01:08:55.790" style="s2">think this is part of what Zak is saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.719" end="01:08:57.859" style="s2">too so I don&#39;t want to say sound like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.790" end="01:09:00.140" style="s2">I&#39;m saying something original here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.859" end="01:09:02.089" style="s2">not just that like will be more</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.089" end="01:09:07.130" style="s2">right but it&#39;s also that we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:09.140" style="s2">educating not just for knowledge we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.130" end="01:09:11.650" style="s2">to be educating from wisdom and those</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.140" end="01:09:15.710" style="s2">who have to be talking to each other and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.650" end="01:09:18.170" style="s2">meshed up together it&#39;s you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.710" end="01:09:19.250" style="s2">of educational theory you actually the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.170" end="01:09:22.609" style="s2">good educational theory because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.250" end="01:09:24.739" style="s2">a lot of crap in educational theory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.609" end="01:09:26.900" style="s2">it&#39;s untethered from good cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.739" end="01:09:28.609" style="s2">science good psychology it&#39;s overly</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.900" end="01:09:30.980" style="s2">politicized it&#39;s ideologically driven</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.609" end="01:09:34.190" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of some time where I</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.980" end="01:09:35.779" style="s2">can see viable stuff is this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.190" end="01:09:38.299" style="s2">sort of core notion is sort of as simple</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.779" end="01:09:41.540" style="s2">to say you know if you start if you if</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.299" end="01:09:44.359" style="s2">you give you if you begin the early age</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.540" end="01:09:47.900" style="s2">project of helping to educate character</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.359" end="01:09:51.770" style="s2">and wisdom kids will then be able to go</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.900" end="01:09:54.109" style="s2">take in deep kinds of complex knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.770" end="01:09:56.420" style="s2">but if you just try to give them the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.109" end="01:09:59.540" style="s2">knowledge without feeding that human</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.420" end="01:10:01.790" style="s2">need for character development and for</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.540" end="01:10:04.280" style="s2">wisdom you&#39;re gonna find that</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.790" end="01:10:06.590" style="s2">many people find that very educationally</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.280" end="01:10:09.470" style="s2">challenging and they ultimately develop</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.590" end="01:10:10.700" style="s2">a hostile attitude towards their</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.470" end="01:10:12.830" style="s2">education in their educational</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.700" end="01:10:14.990" style="s2">background and so not only do I think we</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.830" end="01:10:17.420" style="s2">need to do it culturally we need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.990" end="01:10:20.420" style="s2">bring back the education of wisdom with</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.420" end="01:10:22.490" style="s2">the education of knowledge I think for a</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.420" end="01:10:26.720" style="s2">good pedagogical reasons we need to give</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.490" end="01:10:28.670" style="s2">that&#39;s very very C deep thinking but I</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.720" end="01:10:30.140" style="s2">don&#39;t want that to be the state version</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.670" end="01:10:31.340" style="s2">of Sunday School where we just</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.140" end="01:10:33.260" style="s2">indoctrinate people in whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.340" end="01:10:36.410" style="s2">political ideology seems to be in</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.260" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">fashion right now so the difficulty I</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.410" end="01:10:43.810" style="s2">suppose I&#39;m trying to bring out because</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:45.920" style="s2">I think I want to hear exactly to say is</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.810" end="01:10:48.860" style="s2">because this points towards another</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.920" end="01:10:51.230" style="s2">important point I keep all my questions</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.860" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">are probative because Zack talks about</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.230" end="01:10:57.170" style="s2">this convergence right and to me the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:59.030" style="s2">convergence is I think the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.170" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">the response of a response a deep</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.030" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">response to the question asked how do we</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:07.580" style="s2">bring back the education of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.440" end="01:11:11.180" style="s2">within a pluralistic right framework</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.580" end="01:11:13.850" style="s2">right exactly cuz it&#39;s the world now</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.180" end="01:11:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not a bunch of countries it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.850" end="01:11:24.050" style="s2">Christian Europe or world now no I saw</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.440" end="01:11:26.060" style="s2">back pointing towards that when he when</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.050" end="01:11:28.310" style="s2">he was flagging the necessity of its</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.060" end="01:11:30.830" style="s2">convergence between these various</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.310" end="01:11:32.720" style="s2">traditions which is not assimilating one</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.830" end="01:11:35.420" style="s2">to any master like Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.720" end="01:11:39.170" style="s2">conquering the other ones but of some</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.420" end="01:11:42.590" style="s2">kind of like a dialogo so a convergence</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.170" end="01:11:45.500" style="s2">is possible and I&#39;m wondering if that so</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.590" end="01:11:49.010" style="s2">that struck me is here&#39;s how we could</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.500" end="01:11:52.820" style="s2">get back to the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.010" end="01:11:54.290" style="s2">within a pluralistic framework yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.820" end="01:11:55.730" style="s2">I wrote about that in your essay you</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.290" end="01:11:59.660" style="s2">wrote about a symbolic convergence</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.730" end="01:12:01.310" style="s2">between wisdom ages and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.660" end="01:12:03.560" style="s2">why I&#39;m bringing this question up yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.310" end="01:12:06.770" style="s2">no it&#39;s a very good question and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.560" end="01:12:09.560" style="s2">it&#39;s really one of the more kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.770" end="01:12:11.750" style="s2">exciting things that I think will be</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.560" end="01:12:14.120" style="s2">coming through education in the coming</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.750" end="01:12:16.250" style="s2">decade I think it has two or elsewill</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.120" end="01:12:18.650" style="s2">will come apart at the scenes because of</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.250" end="01:12:20.150" style="s2">the meeting crisis being like the more</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.650" end="01:12:22.700" style="s2">the thorn in the side of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.150" end="01:12:26.870" style="s2">civilization is this this lack of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.700" end="01:12:28.460" style="s2">starting like seven years old and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.870" end="01:12:32.270" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s as I mentioned the paper a</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.460" end="01:12:35.450" style="s2">trans lineage and symbol convergence</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.270" end="01:12:36.830" style="s2">across religious traditions and we spoke</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.450" end="01:12:40.490" style="s2">about last time something can neo</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.830" end="01:12:44.600" style="s2">perennialism like a distilling of some</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.490" end="01:12:47.600" style="s2">not essential conclusions that they all</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.600" end="01:12:50.930" style="s2">supposedly have in common but a form of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.600" end="01:12:53.600" style="s2">dialogue or like you&#39;re saying is an up</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.930" end="01:12:56.480" style="s2">ecology of practice which is to say like</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.600" end="01:12:59.510" style="s2">a classroom where we can put this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.480" end="01:13:01.430" style="s2">in it and be sure that no matter what</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.510" end="01:13:04.480" style="s2">the unique way this kid interacts with</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.430" end="01:13:07.640" style="s2">these materials and this teacher that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:10.160" style="s2">they will come for their for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.640" end="01:13:12.890" style="s2">to create a kind of wisdom synthesis you</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.160" end="01:13:16.850" style="s2">know let&#39;s say by the age of 18 right</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.890" end="01:13:20.150" style="s2">and so that&#39;s not indoctrination that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.850" end="01:13:22.220" style="s2">actually you know more like a Piaget a</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.150" end="01:13:24.260" style="s2">metaphor like a gardening like you make</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.220" end="01:13:28.430" style="s2">the resources available with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.260" end="01:13:31.310" style="s2">container available and then allow them</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.430" end="01:13:33.770" style="s2">to grow into the wisdom that&#39;s unique to</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.310" end="01:13:35.090" style="s2">them and there will be huge pockets of</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.770" end="01:13:36.410" style="s2">overlap well they would just be people</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.090" end="01:13:38.090" style="s2">like hey I&#39;m signing up for that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.410" end="01:13:39.290" style="s2">Buddhism thing that was pretty awesome I</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.090" end="01:13:41.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t really found one that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.290" end="01:13:43.850" style="s2">or though but people who I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.570" end="01:13:45.680" style="s2">actually buying any of this I get why</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.850" end="01:13:47.210" style="s2">it&#39;s important but I&#39;m actually much</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.680" end="01:13:49.010" style="s2">more interested a specific kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.210" end="01:13:50.780" style="s2">scientific problem but I a rich</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.010" end="01:13:54.140" style="s2">humanistic understanding to have my</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.780" end="01:13:58.940" style="s2">scientific identity right so we want</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.140" end="01:14:00.830" style="s2">that possibility as well so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.940" end="01:14:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s very it&#39;s very we wanna create a</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.830" end="01:14:05.990" style="s2">renaissance person not a person who is</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.960" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">locked in their field correct and</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.990" end="01:14:10.490" style="s2">someone who&#39;s used to working</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.480" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">with this language and with this symbol</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.490" end="01:14:17.050" style="s2">and just working with the idea that part</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:19.100" style="s2">of being human is having a kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.050" end="01:14:21.230" style="s2">historically an ontological II</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.100" end="01:14:24.020" style="s2">positioned notion of self something like</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.230" end="01:14:25.850" style="s2">that right that it&#39;s like that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.020" end="01:14:27.650" style="s2">if you don&#39;t if you&#39;re lacking that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.850" end="01:14:29.660" style="s2">gifted it&#39;s very uncomfortable science</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.650" end="01:14:31.460" style="s2">to me you&#39;re in the meeting crisis and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.660" end="01:14:35.720" style="s2">that will cascade into legitimacy crises</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.460" end="01:14:37.370" style="s2">and capability crisis etc and so yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.720" end="01:14:40.040" style="s2">this is the root of it even if we lay</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.370" end="01:14:42.830" style="s2">down the perfect bureaucratic kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.040" end="01:14:45.170" style="s2">like technological digital decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.830" end="01:14:47.960" style="s2">classroom thing was all great and we</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.170" end="01:14:50.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t put this kind of content in it we</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.960" end="01:14:53.480" style="s2">could end up with something way worse</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.240" end="01:14:55.400" style="s2">we&#39;re like more efficiently educating</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.480" end="01:14:58.520" style="s2">people away from wisdom and into</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.400" end="01:15:00.380" style="s2">technocratic conformity right whereas</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.520" end="01:15:02.270" style="s2">what we need to do is like suffuse to</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.380" end="01:15:06.080" style="s2">the digital architecture with these</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.270" end="01:15:08.090" style="s2">forms of wisdom and it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:09.980" style="s2">giving them wisdom it means making the</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.090" end="01:15:12.290" style="s2">ecosystem in which when they step into</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.980" end="01:15:14.750" style="s2">it all of a sudden they&#39;re unless</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.290" end="01:15:16.610" style="s2">they&#39;re like you know bad actors they</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.750" end="01:15:19.370" style="s2">will just by through participation that</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.610" end="01:15:23.140" style="s2">will become wiser or at least</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.370" end="01:15:25.310" style="s2">appreciative of this wisdom discussion</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.140" end="01:15:26.840" style="s2">so yes I think you&#39;re John for point to</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.310" end="01:15:28.550" style="s2">that oh you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.840" end="01:15:31.310" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna mean we have to I mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.550" end="01:15:34.340" style="s2">Thomas björkman makes this point you</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.310" end="01:15:38.360" style="s2">know that we&#39;ve sort of we sort of</p>

<p begin="01:15:41.330" end="01:15:44.630" style="s2">have to because I think the point you</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.070" end="01:15:47.020" style="s2">made earlier you know education has</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.630" end="01:15:50.180" style="s2">begun has become how to train people for</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.020" end="01:15:51.890" style="s2">you know appropriate service to them the</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.180" end="01:15:55.730" style="s2">one god that we still all serve which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.890" end="01:15:57.170" style="s2">the market I&#39;m not a raving Marxists and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.730" end="01:15:59.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to propose the overthrow</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.170" end="01:16:02.630" style="s2">of capitalism or anything like that but</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:05.870" style="s2">what I am talking about is the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.630" end="01:16:09.020" style="s2">we have to have and I think part of what</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.870" end="01:16:11.270" style="s2">this can afford us its affording in an</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.020" end="01:16:13.460" style="s2">individual&#39;s I talk to is a realization</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.270" end="01:16:15.980" style="s2">of oh wait there&#39;s a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.460" end="01:16:19.070" style="s2">really matter to me that aren&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.980" end="01:16:21.230" style="s2">aren&#39;t coming from or aren&#39;t in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.070" end="01:16:21.989" style="s2">governance of the market and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.230" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">normative</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.989" end="01:16:27.420" style="s2">that makes a call on me that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:30.210" style="s2">the call of the market to produce and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.420" end="01:16:31.710" style="s2">consume again and not denying that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.210" end="01:16:34.499" style="s2">need to produce or consume I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.710" end="01:16:36.989" style="s2">saying but what I&#39;m saying is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.499" end="01:16:40.499" style="s2">tyranny of the market and the and and</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.989" end="01:16:41.940" style="s2">and the religious idealization of it I</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.499" end="01:16:45.050" style="s2">think it&#39;s something that&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.940" end="01:16:47.699" style="s2">to be challenged in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.050" end="01:16:50.340" style="s2">this kind of educational reform that</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.699" end="01:16:52.889" style="s2">Zack is proposing yeah and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.340" end="01:16:55.860" style="s2">why this notion of the digital campfire</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.889" end="01:16:57.539" style="s2">or whatever is is kind of coming up even</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.860" end="01:17:02.309" style="s2">though I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m in love with</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.539" end="01:17:04.590" style="s2">this term yet because it still seems</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.309" end="01:17:06.570" style="s2">that it&#39;s a disembodied experience on</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.590" end="01:17:09.409" style="s2">some level it&#39;s not a real campfire but</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.570" end="01:17:12.420" style="s2">but I also like the idea that people</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.409" end="01:17:14.550" style="s2">would want to work on this communal</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.420" end="01:17:16.170" style="s2">activity together and that might be just</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.550" end="01:17:19.530" style="s2">something that people would want to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.170" end="01:17:23.699" style="s2">right that they yeah is so different</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.530" end="01:17:26.400" style="s2">than the alienation of of the market</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.699" end="01:17:29.880" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping I</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.400" end="01:17:31.440" style="s2">mean I&#39;m sort of talking about when I</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.880" end="01:17:33.329" style="s2">was when I was at the store so he was</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.440" end="01:17:35.849" style="s2">sort of stealing the culture the way you</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.329" end="01:17:38.340" style="s2">know other kind of the wins stole the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.849" end="01:17:41.340" style="s2">culture from you know the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.340" end="01:17:43.019" style="s2">militaristic imperialism of antique</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.340" end="01:17:45.389" style="s2">paganism right and and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.019" end="01:17:46.440" style="s2">you know and and you know Paul Van Dyck</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.389" end="01:17:48.599" style="s2">Lee and other people have been talking</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.440" end="01:17:50.190" style="s2">about how we we have not forgotten</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.599" end="01:17:52.590" style="s2">because it&#39;s become second nature to us</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.190" end="01:17:58.380" style="s2">how much and a cultural transformation</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.590" end="01:18:00.719" style="s2">and that was and so you know there is</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.380" end="01:18:03.659" style="s2">this medium outside it&#39;s not completely</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.719" end="01:18:07.679" style="s2">independent but it&#39;s largely outside of</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.659" end="01:18:10.499" style="s2">the movement of the market and that this</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.679" end="01:18:13.800" style="s2">is a place with the virtual camp firing</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.499" end="01:18:16.260" style="s2">where people are finding that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.800" end="01:18:19.650" style="s2">meaning making and the connection making</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.260" end="01:18:23.239" style="s2">and the you know and this this let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.650" end="01:18:25.999" style="s2">call it chaotic educational interaction</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.239" end="01:18:30.900" style="s2">is deeply deeply important to the</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.999" end="01:18:33.110" style="s2">independent of the things that they had</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.900" end="01:18:36.420" style="s2">previously filled their days with and</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.110" end="01:18:39.660" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a real wake</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.420" end="01:18:41.310" style="s2">I think of a real potential for us you</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.660" end="01:18:43.050" style="s2">know because that&#39;s what originally</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.310" end="01:18:44.910" style="s2">happened you know it you had people</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.050" end="01:18:46.770" style="s2">meeting in small groups and they started</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.910" end="01:18:48.300" style="s2">talking to each other and then the small</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.770" end="01:18:50.660" style="s2">groups started talking to each other and</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.300" end="01:18:52.920" style="s2">you can bet this huge bottom up thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.660" end="01:18:55.380" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll go you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.920" end="01:18:57.810" style="s2">smoothly like some kind of you know a</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.380" end="01:19:00.480" style="s2">wonderful home art car can&#39;t be made</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.810" end="01:19:02.040" style="s2">into a product right okay see made into</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.480" end="01:19:05.040" style="s2">a product that I and I fully expected</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.040" end="01:19:07.860" style="s2">the way the Roman Empire resisted in</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.040" end="01:19:10.890" style="s2">powerful ways this up swelling of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.860" end="01:19:13.710" style="s2">of a countercultural movement we might</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.890" end="01:19:16.230" style="s2">get same sort of resistance especially</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.710" end="01:19:17.370" style="s2">by the people who want everything to go</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.230" end="01:19:19.770" style="s2">back to normal</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.370" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">we might try to make it into a product</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.770" end="01:19:24.510" style="s2">right but but not only that they might</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:27.030" style="s2">try to clamp down on it they might try</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.510" end="01:19:30.810" style="s2">to ridicule it they might try to</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.030" end="01:19:33.080" style="s2">undermine it they might try to organize</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.810" end="01:19:36.630" style="s2">that and market the slogans and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.080" end="01:19:38.400" style="s2">placement for some sort of a gap or that</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.630" end="01:19:40.260" style="s2">sort of get for actually undertaking the</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.400" end="01:19:43.380" style="s2">transformation I mean there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.260" end="01:19:44.720" style="s2">kinds of things that I can see I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.380" end="01:19:47.190" style="s2">know what to call it you know a</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.720" end="01:19:49.400" style="s2">socio-economic system doing our</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.190" end="01:19:53.100" style="s2">socio-economic political system doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.400" end="01:19:54.450" style="s2">well I do think that one of the positive</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.100" end="01:19:57.420" style="s2">things that&#39;s happening right now is</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.450" end="01:20:00.480" style="s2">that people are discovering as this</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.420" end="01:20:03.360" style="s2">sounds so trite they&#39;re discovering how</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:05.310" style="s2">really important culture is mmm right</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.360" end="01:20:07.440" style="s2">really important culture is and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.310" end="01:20:08.490" style="s2">different from popular culture which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.440" end="01:20:11.100" style="s2">the part of culture that gets</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.490" end="01:20:12.720" style="s2">commodified and marketed right and how</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.100" end="01:20:14.880" style="s2">much really important remember that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.720" end="01:20:18.540" style="s2">center of culture is cultists that which</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.880" end="01:20:21.780" style="s2">is sacred right rediscovering how</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.540" end="01:20:24.780" style="s2">important culture is the really you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.780" end="01:20:27.390" style="s2">the cognitive cultural grammar is for us</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.780" end="01:20:29.370" style="s2">and I think that is the gives us the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.390" end="01:20:31.170" style="s2">potential you know that this that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.370" end="01:20:35.850" style="s2">could steal the culture in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.170" end="01:20:38.580" style="s2">we need to steal it in order to get the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.850" end="01:20:40.470" style="s2">kind of I think I can&#39;t see how you</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.580" end="01:20:41.850" style="s2">would do what Zak is proposing without</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.470" end="01:20:43.980" style="s2">doing what I&#39;m proposing at the same</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.850" end="01:20:48.200" style="s2">time and saying what do you think about</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.980" end="01:20:48.200" style="s2">that I love it I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.230" end="01:20:56.530" style="s2">yeah a few things come to mind you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.430" end="01:20:58.750" style="s2">one of them is yeah when when the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.530" end="01:21:02.400" style="s2">kind of slips away as it has you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.750" end="01:21:06.010" style="s2">then you&#39;re left with the baseline</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.400" end="01:21:07.620" style="s2">values and needs you know and so and</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.010" end="01:21:09.880" style="s2">then you realize as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.620" end="01:21:13.390" style="s2">talking to people long-form</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.880" end="01:21:17.560" style="s2">conversations around the campfire holy</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.390" end="01:21:19.570" style="s2">crap you know and and the confrontation</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.560" end="01:21:22.570" style="s2">with death is part of the realization</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.570" end="01:21:24.370" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just that the normal</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.570" end="01:21:27.070" style="s2">work routines are disrupted and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.370" end="01:21:28.480" style="s2">can&#39;t do your normal schedule and those</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.070" end="01:21:32.800" style="s2">kinds of things that it&#39;s also that</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.480" end="01:21:34.600" style="s2">everyone&#39;s worried about death and so on</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.800" end="01:21:37.990" style="s2">your deathbed usually you don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.600" end="01:21:40.600" style="s2">stuff like I wish I had worked more</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.990" end="01:21:43.630" style="s2">overtime you know usually you say stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.600" end="01:21:45.370" style="s2">like I wish I had had more family</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.630" end="01:21:47.230" style="s2">dinners spent more time around the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.370" end="01:21:47.560" style="s2">campfire right and said more time to get</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.230" end="01:21:50.410" style="s2">fired</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.560" end="01:21:53.080" style="s2">yeah and the campfire the notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.410" end="01:21:54.730" style="s2">fire the hearth right Estia</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.080" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">I think that&#39;s how you say it or Hestia</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.730" end="01:22:03.570" style="s2">the the Greek goddess of hearth and</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:09.070" style="s2">basically the goddess of inwardness and</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.570" end="01:22:11.200" style="s2">composure composure and focus and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.070" end="01:22:13.390" style="s2">yeah there is that returning to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.200" end="01:22:20.080" style="s2">uncommon afire bowl and realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.390" end="01:22:22.480" style="s2">it&#39;s still there and you know to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.080" end="01:22:24.040" style="s2">degree to which we get used to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.480" end="01:22:26.830" style="s2">ironic a little bit right that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.040" end="01:22:28.450" style="s2">supposed to be isolating but I&#39;ve in my</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.830" end="01:22:30.550" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve been having more calls</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.450" end="01:22:32.980" style="s2">and more conversations with a writer or</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.550" end="01:22:36.520" style="s2">with a wider range of people than I</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.980" end="01:22:39.670" style="s2">usually do and so and most of them have</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.520" end="01:22:41.110" style="s2">not been kind of work calls you know I</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.670" end="01:22:43.120" style="s2">don&#39;t really consider this even like</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.110" end="01:22:48.220" style="s2">work like what we&#39;re doing here is</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.120" end="01:22:50.590" style="s2">actually yeah culture as a way of ultra</p>
