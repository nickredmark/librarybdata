<p begin="00:00:28.160" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">transformative in many ways for me in</p>

<p begin="00:02:38.590" end="00:02:42.430" style="s2">short course you have been there for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.600" end="00:02:45.250" style="s2">you know summer horticultural residency</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.430" end="00:02:47.739" style="s2">or master&#39;s program it seems one thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.250" end="00:02:50.079" style="s2">that most people have in common is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.739" end="00:02:53.049" style="s2">deep connection that spans in your case</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.079" end="00:02:55.569" style="s2">you know decades and you know for many</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.049" end="00:02:58.090" style="s2">people as a similar amount of time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.569" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s been wonderful to be there you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.090" end="00:03:02.170" style="s2">know as you said I&#39;m relatively new to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:04.810" style="s2">being in October and to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.170" end="00:03:06.519" style="s2">conversations with students again who</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.810" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">are there for a short time or for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.519" end="00:03:11.170" style="s2">entire year and see that transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:13.060" style="s2">happen and that&#39;s honestly one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.170" end="00:03:16.840" style="s2">reasons that I was drawn to Schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">in the first place I had been at at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.840" end="00:03:22.150" style="s2">small college in Vermont in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:23.560" style="s2">called Sterling College which is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:26.410" style="s2">know a pretty small but a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.560" end="00:03:29.079" style="s2">students all undergraduate focused on</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.410" end="00:03:31.329" style="s2">ecological thinking and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.079" end="00:03:34.690" style="s2">community orientation and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.329" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">thing with a farm that supports the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.690" end="00:03:39.970" style="s2">college and all of the students</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:41.979" style="s2">participate in community work so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.970" end="00:03:44.810" style="s2">know the the connections between that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.979" end="00:03:47.750" style="s2">pedagogy and Schumacher&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.810" end="00:03:49.640" style="s2">really profound but what I found at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.750" end="00:03:52.540" style="s2">end of 15 years at Sterling was that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.640" end="00:03:55.510" style="s2">was looking for a place to that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.540" end="00:03:58.160" style="s2">engaged perhaps more on a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.510" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">and you know worked with graduate</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.160" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">students and worked with you know a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:05.060" style="s2">greater number of students you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:07.160" style="s2">students that come in on short courses</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.060" end="00:04:08.390" style="s2">for example have been the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.160" end="00:04:11.780" style="s2">years you know five or six hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.390" end="00:04:14.180" style="s2">students per year and if if I have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.780" end="00:04:17.389" style="s2">opportunity to support a college that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.180" end="00:04:18.590" style="s2">has a greater impact that way and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.389" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">really what I was looking for in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.590" end="00:04:24.410" style="s2">next chapter of my own academic</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:25.729" style="s2">leadership and hopefully teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.410" end="00:04:28.389" style="s2">know that&#39;s on the horizon for me as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.729" end="00:04:32.450" style="s2">well at Schumacher so you know it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.389" end="00:04:34.760" style="s2">a really in well it&#39;s been a challenging</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.450" end="00:04:37.130" style="s2">transition we talked before the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.760" end="00:04:39.940" style="s2">conversation here a little bit about you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.130" end="00:04:43.190" style="s2">know anybody coming into a new position</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.940" end="00:04:45.350" style="s2">this particular year you know with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.190" end="00:04:49.190" style="s2">with the covent you know pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.350" end="00:04:51.800" style="s2">the crisis and stuff the associated</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.190" end="00:04:54.200" style="s2">financial challenges and you know impact</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.800" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">on higher education generally it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.200" end="00:04:58.130" style="s2">particularly challenging time and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">happy it&#39;s to talk about how Schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.130" end="00:05:01.580" style="s2">is approaching some of those in really I</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">think interesting and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.580" end="00:05:06.620" style="s2">innovative ways but initially the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">transition was fairly comfortable you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.620" end="00:05:10.570" style="s2">know coming from a place from a higher</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:12.770" style="s2">ed institution that&#39;s based on community</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.570" end="00:05:14.450" style="s2">where everybody sits in a circle and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.770" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">then talks together on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.450" end="00:05:19.539" style="s2">and eats together you know those are I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:22.370" style="s2">think some of the essential facets</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.539" end="00:05:25.190" style="s2">essential tenants really of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.370" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">what I think is a deep holistic learning</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.190" end="00:05:30.229" style="s2">experience and you know I talk often</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:32.060" style="s2">about you know community learning as</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.229" end="00:05:34.580" style="s2">being the basis of what Schumacher does</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.060" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">so it has been for a long time and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.580" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">I&#39;m really focusing a lot of energy on</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">you know making sure that that stays as</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:44.030" style="s2">intact as possible even when students</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">aren&#39;t able to be there in person and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.030" end="00:05:48.350" style="s2">for me this this whole notion egg in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:50.990" style="s2">Eco village movement we call them for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.350" end="00:05:54.979" style="s2">while living in learning centers and of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.990" end="00:05:56.749" style="s2">veggie where the setting and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.979" end="00:05:59.419" style="s2">community and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.749" end="00:06:01.399" style="s2">the rhythms of the community a part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.419" end="00:06:03.019" style="s2">the pedagogy it&#39;s it&#39;s not what you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.399" end="00:06:05.389" style="s2">learn in classroom only it&#39;s it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.019" end="00:06:10.189" style="s2">by osmosis you learn so many other</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.389" end="00:06:13.539" style="s2">skills and so many other more mindful</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.189" end="00:06:16.699" style="s2">ways of living in community and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.539" end="00:06:19.759" style="s2">absolutely made the I think the well for</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.699" end="00:06:21.529" style="s2">me since I&#39;m not in the classroom you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.759" end="00:06:23.299" style="s2">know or out on field courses or anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.529" end="00:06:26.509" style="s2">like that you know my main interaction</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.299" end="00:06:28.369" style="s2">with students is at mealtimes and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.509" end="00:06:30.169" style="s2">know I think those are actually even for</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.369" end="00:06:31.969" style="s2">students and faculty and staff some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.169" end="00:06:34.309" style="s2">the most valuable conversations because</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.969" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">those happen you know I think Satish</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.309" end="00:06:36.829" style="s2">would say you know some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:38.360" style="s2">meaningful conversations happen when</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.829" end="00:06:40.279" style="s2">you&#39;re washing up the dishes or when</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.360" end="00:06:41.779" style="s2">you&#39;re emptying the compost and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.279" end="00:06:44.079" style="s2">that&#39;s when the true learning happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.779" end="00:06:46.459" style="s2">and I think you know one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.079" end="00:06:50.360" style="s2">Schumacher has that a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.459" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">universities do not is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:55.969" style="s2">spaciousness really for having that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:58.399" style="s2">the time for reflection and for making</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.969" end="00:07:01.099" style="s2">unique and innovative connections that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.399" end="00:07:03.019" style="s2">you might not ordinarily make you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.099" end="00:07:04.279" style="s2">intergenerational ones when we have you</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.019" end="00:07:06.499" style="s2">know students on an L during short</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.279" end="00:07:07.999" style="s2">course for example you know have really</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.499" end="00:07:08.959" style="s2">deep conversations with students who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.999" end="00:07:12.679" style="s2">in a collage achill Design Thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.959" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">masters program and you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.679" end="00:07:15.649" style="s2">there are networks create and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:17.889" style="s2">relationships created in those</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.649" end="00:07:20.629" style="s2">conversations that persist well beyond</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.889" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">students experience at the college yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.629" end="00:07:27.319" style="s2">I mean I remember I know that the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:29.029" style="s2">rhythms have been slightly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.319" end="00:07:30.829" style="s2">slightly less packed than they were when</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.029" end="00:07:33.079" style="s2">when I was there almost 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.829" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">during the masters in holistic science</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.079" end="00:07:37.069" style="s2">because at that time the Masters was</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:38.509" style="s2">only four years old and there was still</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.069" end="00:07:41.449" style="s2">quite a lot of this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.509" end="00:07:43.849" style="s2">building with with Plymouth and making</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.449" end="00:07:46.099" style="s2">sure that we proved that we were an</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.849" end="00:07:48.829" style="s2">academic course that deserve the Masters</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.099" end="00:07:51.009" style="s2">of in science and and so in my whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.829" end="00:07:54.110" style="s2">heart we were still heavily over</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.009" end="00:07:58.399" style="s2">examined we had many more essays than</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.110" end="00:08:01.219" style="s2">they have now but I I felt it because</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.399" end="00:08:03.589" style="s2">there&#39;s all these parallel streams and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.219" end="00:08:05.689" style="s2">mean in those days there was only one</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.589" end="00:08:08.419" style="s2">masters but there were more short</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.689" end="00:08:10.570" style="s2">courses and it just created this</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.419" end="00:08:13.260" style="s2">opportunity to learn that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.570" end="00:08:18.040" style="s2">as a bit of an omnivore in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.260" end="00:08:20.680" style="s2">intellectual disciplines I just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.040" end="00:08:28.390" style="s2">almost like I felt a intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.680" end="00:08:30.700" style="s2">glutton for slightly overwhelming and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.390" end="00:08:33.669" style="s2">took a while to decelerate from that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.700" end="00:08:37.030" style="s2">I think it is a wonderful there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.669" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">always something on that is another</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.030" end="00:08:40.540" style="s2">learning opportunity like just if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:42.280" style="s2">look at the blackboard or the whiteboard</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.540" end="00:08:44.350" style="s2">and in the entrance hall and then some</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.280" end="00:08:48.430" style="s2">somebody from another course is offering</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.350" end="00:08:50.890" style="s2">a short to talk or walk on that more or</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.430" end="00:08:53.620" style="s2">all these other activities that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.890" end="00:08:55.900" style="s2">just make it a really rich environment</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.620" end="00:08:57.100" style="s2">absolutely I mean you know like you said</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.900" end="00:08:58.930" style="s2">it&#39;s the the living and learning</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.100" end="00:09:00.430" style="s2">together that&#39;s or create the fabric</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.930" end="00:09:02.140" style="s2">that I think is exactly what students</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.430" end="00:09:03.790" style="s2">are looking for when they choose a place</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:06.940" style="s2">like Schumacher to do their masters or</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.790" end="00:09:10.810" style="s2">you know or soon to do bachelor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.940" end="00:09:13.230" style="s2">actually you know that&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.810" end="00:09:16.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s just reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.230" end="00:09:19.000" style="s2">the one thing that has always been a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.780" end="00:09:20.770" style="s2">dream of a lot of people is making the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.000" end="00:09:22.660" style="s2">actual infrastructure a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.770" end="00:09:25.660" style="s2">like what they&#39;ve ador calls architect</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.660" end="00:09:28.180" style="s2">the architecture has pedagogy and on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.660" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">one hand there was something about there</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.180" end="00:09:32.590" style="s2">is something about the old posten and as</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:34.590" style="s2">a building that that really feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:37.810" style="s2">sort of alchemical cauldron where</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.590" end="00:09:39.910" style="s2">transformation happens but but all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.810" end="00:09:41.910" style="s2">the accommodation blocks of course it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.910" end="00:09:44.980" style="s2">would be wonderful to find a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.910" end="00:09:47.860" style="s2">philanthropist who says build the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.980" end="00:09:51.370" style="s2">amazing ecological retrofits that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.860" end="00:09:53.500" style="s2">world has ever seen and exactly take</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.370" end="00:09:56.170" style="s2">these blocks out of the seventies a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.500" end="00:09:57.910" style="s2">certain charm most people by now loves</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.170" end="00:10:00.610" style="s2">the blocks because they have that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.910" end="00:10:03.310" style="s2">seventies charm well what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.610" end="00:10:05.350" style="s2">about what you say is that you know as</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.310" end="00:10:09.520" style="s2">you know the old posture and has not</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.350" end="00:10:11.650" style="s2">been accessible for you know that since</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.520" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">before I arrived so well over a year now</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.650" end="00:10:16.960" style="s2">because of the you know the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:18.700" style="s2">to the roof and we needed to recite the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.960" end="00:10:21.610" style="s2">entire roof nobody had done so for about</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.700" end="00:10:23.110" style="s2">four hundred years apparently and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.610" end="00:10:23.889" style="s2">were able to get financial support to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.110" end="00:10:26.949" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.889" end="00:10:28.239" style="s2">and you know work on that began shortly</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.949" end="00:10:31.929" style="s2">after the first of the year</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.239" end="00:10:33.910" style="s2">and then abruptly stopped in March and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.929" end="00:10:35.649" style="s2">think that I saw some construction</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.910" end="00:10:38.379" style="s2">workers there just the other day so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.649" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">think we&#39;re getting back into it and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.379" end="00:10:44.230" style="s2">hopefully that construction will be done</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:46.679" style="s2">now in the very early months of next</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.230" end="00:10:50.579" style="s2">year in time for our 30th anniversary</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.679" end="00:10:53.169" style="s2">celebration in in May of 2021</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.579" end="00:10:54.669" style="s2">interesting that you know everybody had</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.169" end="00:10:56.949" style="s2">talked about the old posture and when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.669" end="00:10:59.139" style="s2">was doing research you know about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.949" end="00:11:00.759" style="s2">college before arriving here almost all</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.139" end="00:11:03.009" style="s2">of the photographs I could see were of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.759" end="00:11:05.529" style="s2">the old posture and then I arrived is</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.009" end="00:11:07.569" style="s2">that well actually we can&#39;t use that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.529" end="00:11:10.689" style="s2">building for another you know 16 18</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.569" end="00:11:13.779" style="s2">months and what has struck me is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.689" end="00:11:16.299" style="s2">very quickly you know the staff and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.779" end="00:11:18.399" style="s2">students at the college have recreated</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.299" end="00:11:22.059" style="s2">Schumacher in whatever spaces were of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.399" end="00:11:22.929" style="s2">have been available yeah I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.059" end="00:11:25.149" style="s2">when I was dead</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.929" end="00:11:26.919" style="s2">last time I was there was in October</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.149" end="00:11:29.589" style="s2">when I taught a few days on the masters</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.919" end="00:11:31.899" style="s2">in ecological design thinking and and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.589" end="00:11:33.819" style="s2">was sort of dreading going there with</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.899" end="00:11:35.290" style="s2">not being able to access the pasta and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.819" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">when I arrived and saw the fence around</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.290" end="00:11:38.829" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.559" style="s2">but you you&#39;re right in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.829" end="00:11:45.160" style="s2">actual feel and the odd set a craft</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.559" end="00:11:48.249" style="s2">center seems to function just as well to</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.160" end="00:11:50.139" style="s2">create right so in some ways what that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.249" end="00:11:54.279" style="s2">taught me very quickly and I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.139" end="00:11:55.779" style="s2">of the you know longer time staff at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.279" end="00:11:58.689" style="s2">college was that the college isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.779" end="00:12:00.220" style="s2">necessarily a building at all and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.689" end="00:12:02.379" style="s2">the old posturing is a lovely building</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.220" end="00:12:04.239" style="s2">but the college is the spirit and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.379" end="00:12:07.089" style="s2">college is the community the networks</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.239" end="00:12:08.919" style="s2">the relationships and the pedagogy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.089" end="00:12:12.699" style="s2">it I don&#39;t think it really matters where</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.919" end="00:12:16.149" style="s2">it is but it can if it&#39;s held as</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.699" end="00:12:18.449" style="s2">strongly as it is and you know the staff</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.149" end="00:12:20.799" style="s2">really are as passionate as they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.449" end="00:12:23.589" style="s2">then I think that learning community can</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.799" end="00:12:25.419" style="s2">be in any space and you know I think it</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.589" end="00:12:28.389" style="s2">is where it is right now because of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.419" end="00:12:30.069" style="s2">effectively an emergency that required</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.389" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">them to vacate the old Parson very</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.069" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">quickly but you know quite rapidly I</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:37.300" style="s2">think everybody has settled into you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:39.700" style="s2">know other accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.300" end="00:12:44.170" style="s2">offices other teaching and learning</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.700" end="00:12:46.680" style="s2">spaces which may change again and what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.170" end="00:12:50.830" style="s2">was more referring to is like when I I</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.680" end="00:12:53.080" style="s2">was also surprised how easily the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.830" end="00:12:55.060" style="s2">process in the sense the feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.080" end="00:12:59.380" style="s2">community can continue even without the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.060" end="00:13:02.649" style="s2">old Posten and its mother um since like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.380" end="00:13:04.779" style="s2">when I was there 20 years ago um there</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.649" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">wasn&#39;t as much food grown that like all</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.779" end="00:13:09.579" style="s2">the food was local and organic it came</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:12.130" style="s2">up from River fort and so on but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.579" end="00:13:14.019" style="s2">been an evolution to even more practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.130" end="00:13:15.610" style="s2">what one preaches and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.019" end="00:13:18.550" style="s2">would&#39;ve oh of course at some point</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.610" end="00:13:21.010" style="s2">would always be a dream to generate</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.550" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">their own renewable energy really have</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.010" end="00:13:27.850" style="s2">very efficient eco retrofit buildings</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:29.399" style="s2">and ensure what can be done teaching</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.850" end="00:13:31.959" style="s2">that that you don&#39;t have to pull down</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.399" end="00:13:34.660" style="s2">the old structures you can retrofit them</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.959" end="00:13:38.920" style="s2">in a way that makes it much more energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.660" end="00:13:42.209" style="s2">efficient and more beautiful yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.920" end="00:13:44.829" style="s2">but how like because you&#39;re you also</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.209" end="00:13:47.320" style="s2">ahead of Dartington learning I think is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.829" end="00:13:50.050" style="s2">the title yeah and I am so I might I</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.320" end="00:13:52.329" style="s2">think I had the longest title at larding</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.050" end="00:13:53.620" style="s2">Tanisha&#39;s head of Schumacher college and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.329" end="00:13:57.160" style="s2">interim director of learning for</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.620" end="00:13:59.410" style="s2">Dartington Hall trust yeah it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.160" end="00:14:03.790" style="s2">really fit on a nametag or business card</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.410" end="00:14:08.200" style="s2">very well but so I took on the role of</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.790" end="00:14:11.649" style="s2">director of learning only about around</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.200" end="00:14:13.209" style="s2">810 weeks ago as the sort of structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.649" end="00:14:15.940" style="s2">of the director to Dartington you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.209" end="00:14:18.040" style="s2">shifted a little bit and it struck me</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.940" end="00:14:22.120" style="s2">that no one it was a great opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.040" end="00:14:25.180" style="s2">to be able to connect you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.120" end="00:14:26.410" style="s2">Schumacher&#39;s vision with and pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.180" end="00:14:28.810" style="s2">and community learning and everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.410" end="00:14:31.209" style="s2">with other learning initiatives that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.810" end="00:14:33.010" style="s2">were happening at Dartington you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.209" end="00:14:35.470" style="s2">the art school is the most obvious one</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.010" end="00:14:38.579" style="s2">of those we were launching a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.470" end="00:14:41.220" style="s2">master&#39;s programs this coming year one</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.579" end="00:14:45.550" style="s2">poetics of imagination with Martin Shaw</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.220" end="00:14:47.520" style="s2">and Tracy war and another arts in place</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.550" end="00:14:50.499" style="s2">which is going to start in January and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.520" end="00:14:52.329" style="s2">you know I think as</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.499" end="00:14:54.759" style="s2">we talked about how we were going to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.329" end="00:14:56.049" style="s2">that well one it naturally increases the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.759" end="00:14:58.599" style="s2">number of students who were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.049" end="00:15:01.509" style="s2">at Dartington as a whole and it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.599" end="00:15:03.129" style="s2">really important to me that all of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.509" end="00:15:05.709" style="s2">students have a shared community</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.129" end="00:15:08.169" style="s2">learning experience and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.709" end="00:15:10.119" style="s2">segregate students in an art school from</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.169" end="00:15:12.789" style="s2">students at Schumacher that they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.119" end="00:15:15.389" style="s2">fully integrated have meals together you</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.789" end="00:15:18.279" style="s2">know do community work together have</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.389" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">relatively similar experiences and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.279" end="00:15:23.109" style="s2">also cross fertilize in ways that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.449" style="s2">think you know I&#39;ve talked about already</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.109" end="00:15:27.669" style="s2">at mealtimes and so on between arts</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.449" end="00:15:29.949" style="s2">programs and say holistic science or</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.669" end="00:15:34.059" style="s2">regenerative economics in ways I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.949" end="00:15:37.719" style="s2">that can be really rich and so because</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.059" end="00:15:39.429" style="s2">it&#39;s like when 20 years ago the the art</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.719" end="00:15:41.729" style="s2">school was running completely separate</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.429" end="00:15:44.529" style="s2">from from the college and I make &#39;shy</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.729" end="00:15:46.749" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing that I hadn&#39;t clocked</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.529" end="00:15:48.729" style="s2">so to speak and that the art schools has</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.749" end="00:15:50.859" style="s2">come back because I thought that for why</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.729" end="00:15:53.439" style="s2">the art school actually moved out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.859" end="00:15:56.739" style="s2">tottington didn&#39;t it it did and so this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.439" end="00:15:58.599" style="s2">is not the same name it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.739" end="00:16:01.419" style="s2">Dartington College of Arts it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.599" end="00:16:04.179" style="s2">Darden School of Arts you know but</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.419" end="00:16:09.489" style="s2">effectively it is a resurgence a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.179" end="00:16:12.069" style="s2">renaissance of the art schools residents</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.489" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">you know on the estate you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.069" end="00:16:16.389" style="s2">fantastic facilities in the studio</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:19.179" style="s2">buildings in what&#39;s called space what</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.389" end="00:16:21.549" style="s2">has been called lower closed you know we</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.179" end="00:16:24.669" style="s2">have residential accommodation for you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.549" end="00:16:26.649" style="s2">know at least 180 students at this point</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.669" end="00:16:29.709" style="s2">you know across the estate and so as</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.649" end="00:16:32.169" style="s2">we&#39;re looking you know doing three four</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.709" end="00:16:34.869" style="s2">five year plans looking ahead we</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.169" end="00:16:38.679" style="s2">actually anticipate between you know a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.869" end="00:16:41.889" style="s2">hundred and twenty onto 150 students at</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.679" end="00:16:44.019" style="s2">all times at Dartington across all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.889" end="00:16:48.419" style="s2">the different learning experiences you</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.019" end="00:16:51.189" style="s2">make him really happy this is for awhile</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.419" end="00:16:53.409" style="s2">it just it&#39;s it&#39;s refreshing to see that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.189" end="00:16:55.209" style="s2">kind of vision of bringing the two</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.409" end="00:16:57.969" style="s2">together and really working with this</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.209" end="00:17:00.099" style="s2">state as a whole again and because this</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.969" end="00:17:00.930" style="s2">it&#39;s just been a long time this slight</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.099" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.930" end="00:17:04.949" style="s2">between darting who&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:06.900" style="s2">feeding Schumer hard to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.949" end="00:17:08.459" style="s2">wonderful work in terms of supporting it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.900" end="00:17:10.260" style="s2">and a lot of people don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.459" end="00:17:12.179" style="s2">that they look at the prices of sri maha</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.260" end="00:17:14.459" style="s2">college and they think oh that&#39;s elitist</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.179" end="00:17:17.010" style="s2">that&#39;s too expensive but I&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.459" end="00:17:19.860" style="s2">both sides of taking courses and helping</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.010" end="00:17:21.900" style="s2">to organize them in and from from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.860" end="00:17:27.720" style="s2">inside out it&#39;s too cheap it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.900" end="00:17:28.380" style="s2">impossible to run and and in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.720" end="00:17:33.960" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.380" end="00:17:37.500" style="s2">I think people didn&#39;t understand that to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.960" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">do the kind of small group intensive</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.500" end="00:17:42.450" style="s2">with world-class teachers education even</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:43.530" style="s2">if the teachers also come and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.450" end="00:17:44.280" style="s2">really earn what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.530" end="00:17:47.820" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.280" end="00:17:50.429" style="s2">it still is a pretty tight economic game</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.820" end="00:17:51.780" style="s2">to make it work and and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.429" end="00:17:53.870" style="s2">needs filling traffic help I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.780" end="00:17:58.500" style="s2">it&#39;s for me it&#39;s an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.870" end="00:18:00.420" style="s2">we&#39;re really mistaken as a society</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.500" end="00:18:03.420" style="s2">culture and civilization if we think</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.420" end="00:18:06.630" style="s2">that education needs to wash its own</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.420" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">face as a business mmm education should</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.630" end="00:18:11.720" style="s2">be our investment into the future of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:13.980" style="s2">humanity into the future of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.720" end="00:18:17.580" style="s2">workforce that will provide first from</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.980" end="00:18:19.230" style="s2">well it just shouldn&#39;t have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.580" end="00:18:21.540" style="s2">business because the minute becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.230" end="00:18:23.730" style="s2">business it also teaches differently in</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.540" end="00:18:27.179" style="s2">a different way and and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.730" end="00:18:29.100" style="s2">that&#39;s what was culture well at the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.179" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">time you know it it is a business</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.100" end="00:18:33.660" style="s2">unfortunately you know higher education</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:36.390" style="s2">is a very unique and challenging</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.660" end="00:18:38.970" style="s2">business to be in and I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.390" end="00:18:42.059" style="s2">the part of our approach to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.970" end="00:18:43.800" style="s2">challenge right now is you know with as</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.059" end="00:18:45.630" style="s2">with a lot of higher ed institutions is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.800" end="00:18:49.410" style="s2">to diversify the learning offering</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.630" end="00:18:50.850" style="s2">portfolio and to be able to you know for</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.410" end="00:18:52.590" style="s2">me and to be able to engage more</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.850" end="00:18:53.550" style="s2">learners with exactly the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.590" end="00:18:55.230" style="s2">things that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.550" end="00:18:57.330" style="s2">terms richness the transformational</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.230" end="00:18:59.580" style="s2">learning experiences the access and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.330" end="00:19:03.480" style="s2">networks access to leading thinkers in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.580" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">the field and you know with this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.480" end="00:19:08.460" style="s2">reconnection or you know further</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:10.860" style="s2">engagement with with Dartington as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.460" end="00:19:12.750" style="s2">whole we have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.860" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">increase our short courses for</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.750" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">example Schumacher short courses that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:20.790" style="s2">have been really successful over the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:24.750" style="s2">last several years can now engage you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.790" end="00:19:28.040" style="s2">know learners in areas such as craft and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.750" end="00:19:31.140" style="s2">visual art and performance and music and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.040" end="00:19:33.060" style="s2">you know mind body ecology connections</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.140" end="00:19:34.680" style="s2">and wellness and really across the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.060" end="00:19:37.380" style="s2">curriculum and I think that the market</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.680" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">is obviously there oh and and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.380" end="00:19:42.840" style="s2">horticulture and food and farming which</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:44.550" style="s2">is something we&#39;re already doing and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.840" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">know we can talk about that as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.550" end="00:19:48.210" style="s2">would like to talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">the courses that we&#39;re offering now and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.210" end="00:19:54.240" style="s2">coming up and you know again in these</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:57.150" style="s2">you know it&#39;s being it&#39;s become cliche</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.240" end="00:19:58.980" style="s2">to say these are unprecedented times but</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.150" end="00:20:00.930" style="s2">you know they are and what else are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.980" end="00:20:04.500" style="s2">going to say you know I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.930" end="00:20:06.840" style="s2">very quickly been able to put together a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.500" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">you know fairly modest portfolio of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.840" end="00:20:11.790" style="s2">things that are accessible to people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:14.670" style="s2">are not able to come because we can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.730" end="00:21:53.390" style="s2">and with just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.990" end="00:21:55.730" style="s2">post-production like where you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.390" end="00:21:59.270" style="s2">put a modern intro and I&#39;m not an outro</p>

<p begin="00:21:59.270" end="00:22:04.040" style="s2">create a website where people can stream</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.310" end="00:22:07.460" style="s2">and then donate and then you you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.040" end="00:22:09.530" style="s2">somebody else upload one of them every</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.460" end="00:22:10.970" style="s2">couple of days to YouTube and you build</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.530" end="00:22:13.040" style="s2">your own through through putting this</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.970" end="00:22:15.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a vast amount of resource I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.040" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">build your own YouTube channel I think I</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.470" end="00:22:22.340" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a nice project</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:24.710" style="s2">that in comparison for the the reach the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.340" end="00:22:27.710" style="s2">benefit to people that like the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.710" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">seeding of valuable information and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.710" end="00:22:31.580" style="s2">spreading it and the benefit in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:33.860" style="s2">advertising that it would get for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.580" end="00:22:35.720" style="s2">college I think it&#39;s it&#39;s worth doing I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.860" end="00:22:38.420" style="s2">think you&#39;re right absolutely I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.720" end="00:22:40.430" style="s2">have a modest archive already of ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.420" end="00:22:43.580" style="s2">that have been digitized or that were</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.430" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">recorded digitally to begin with and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.580" end="00:22:47.810" style="s2">know some work needs to be done on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:49.700" style="s2">to package it nicely it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.810" end="00:22:51.680" style="s2">sitting on YouTube and various other</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.700" end="00:22:53.180" style="s2">places but I think you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.680" end="00:22:55.310" style="s2">this is it would be a great project to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.180" end="00:22:58.160" style="s2">jump into yeah but we wanted to get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.310" end="00:23:00.170" style="s2">because I&#39;m you know I&#39;m teaching on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.160" end="00:23:02.600" style="s2">MA in ecological design thinking have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.170" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">done for the last three or four years</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.600" end="00:23:09.950" style="s2">yeah she helped when when we first build</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:11.990" style="s2">up the the course I am to the then</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.950" end="00:23:13.700" style="s2">director I suggested that Seton Baxter</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.990" end="00:23:16.340" style="s2">would be the right person to help launch</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.700" end="00:23:19.150" style="s2">that course he&#39;s like sometimes even</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.340" end="00:23:22.010" style="s2">within the college there is a lack of um</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.150" end="00:23:26.180" style="s2">transmission of the historic connections</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.010" end="00:23:28.250" style="s2">at the time nobody knew you were who see</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.180" end="00:23:32.630" style="s2">him Baxter was who was when I was there</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.250" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">he was a really important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.630" end="00:23:36.890" style="s2">college and and then for a while he was</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:39.170" style="s2">external examiner and I very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.890" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">enjoyed my conversations were seeking</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.170" end="00:23:45.530" style="s2">he&#39;s been there gentlemen yeah so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.160" end="00:23:47.900" style="s2">let&#39;s get into the the masters courses</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.530" end="00:23:49.250" style="s2">because they all look or we do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.900" end="00:23:51.320" style="s2">Daniel just one other thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.250" end="00:23:52.520" style="s2">currently doing and I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.320" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">highlight those things I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.520" end="00:23:56.210" style="s2">they&#39;re important and actually this</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.950" style="s2">one&#39;s quite innovative is over the last</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.210" end="00:24:01.010" style="s2">couple of years we&#39;ve had really record</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.950" end="00:24:03.260" style="s2">enrollments in the summer horticulture</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.010" end="00:24:06.460" style="s2">residency program and in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.260" end="00:24:08.390" style="s2">increased our enrollment this year in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.460" end="00:24:09.710" style="s2">anticipation of having more students</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.390" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">than ever in residence we weren&#39;t able</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.710" end="00:24:15.110" style="s2">to do that so we launched an online</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:19.000" style="s2">gardening course which effectively sold</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.110" end="00:24:22.360" style="s2">out with a week and it started I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.000" end="00:24:24.530" style="s2">not quite a fortnight ago and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.360" end="00:24:26.690" style="s2">quite successful from all the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.530" end="00:24:28.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard about about 50 students on</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.690" end="00:24:31.970" style="s2">this online gardening course and it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.550" end="00:24:34.490" style="s2">true to schumacher form experiential and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.970" end="00:24:36.350" style="s2">so students engage in gardening in their</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.490" end="00:24:38.120" style="s2">own you know home spaces and then they</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.350" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">come back and talk about the experiences</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.120" end="00:24:42.980" style="s2">that they&#39;ve had and talk with colum</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:45.710" style="s2">who&#39;s our lead grower and then who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.980" end="00:24:47.810" style="s2">lead on the course and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.710" end="00:24:49.550" style="s2">a great model and very different from a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.810" end="00:24:50.570" style="s2">lot of sort of online gardening courses</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.550" end="00:24:52.270" style="s2">that are out there and so that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.570" end="00:24:54.560" style="s2">to be running for the next six months</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.270" end="00:24:56.210" style="s2">wonderful yeah I mean a lot of people</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.170" end="00:25:43.220" style="s2">has and there have been you know I read</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.270" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">the times I read supplements on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.220" end="00:25:47.180" style="s2">basis to sort of see what the pulse is</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:48.500" style="s2">and I&#39;m in conversation with colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.180" end="00:25:51.260" style="s2">around the world about sort of what the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.500" end="00:25:52.790" style="s2">best guesses are as far as you know how</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.260" end="00:25:55.700" style="s2">are we going to be able to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.790" end="00:25:57.260" style="s2">students come September so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.700" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">number of different scenarios but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.260" end="00:26:02.570" style="s2">one that we are you know currently</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:03.980" style="s2">working with is that we are not planning</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.790" end="00:26:53.890" style="s2">have most if not all students and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.260" end="00:26:57.410" style="s2">residents again so we are launching</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.890" end="00:26:59.150" style="s2">three courses you know two at Schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.410" end="00:27:00.680" style="s2">and one at the art school so I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.150" end="00:27:03.410" style="s2">I always talk about all of them together</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.680" end="00:27:05.390" style="s2">so ecological design thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.410" end="00:27:06.950" style="s2">regenerative economics regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.390" end="00:27:08.780" style="s2">economics used to be economics for</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.950" end="00:27:10.790" style="s2">transition and we&#39;ve made that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.780" end="00:27:14.180" style="s2">transition to regenerative I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.790" end="00:27:18.380" style="s2">a more appropriate term in evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.180" end="00:27:21.080" style="s2">the course and and then poetics of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.380" end="00:27:24.170" style="s2">imagination at the art school and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.080" end="00:27:25.940" style="s2">three of those are being taught they</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.170" end="00:27:29.390" style="s2">were going to be taught originally has</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.940" end="00:27:31.610" style="s2">low residency programs and so as we get</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.390" end="00:27:33.980" style="s2">through these sort of you know creative</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.610" end="00:27:37.160" style="s2">first couple of modules they will get</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.980" end="00:27:42.340" style="s2">into a rhythm of low residency and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.160" end="00:27:44.510" style="s2">know we did that for two reasons one -</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.340" end="00:27:46.550" style="s2">well the principal reason it really is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.510" end="00:27:48.770" style="s2">to make the courses as accessible as</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.550" end="00:27:51.080" style="s2">possible to as broad a range of students</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.770" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">as possible and the second is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.080" end="00:27:56.780" style="s2">increase the number of students from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:28:00.110" style="s2">UK who are able to or you know enticed</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.780" end="00:28:02.570" style="s2">in attention market courses you know as</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.110" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware we&#39;ve had a for</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.570" end="00:28:06.580" style="s2">the preponderance of students the vast</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:07.779" style="s2">majority</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.580" end="00:28:08.919" style="s2">you know we&#39;re entering to have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.779" end="00:28:11.529" style="s2">international students over the last</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.919" end="00:28:13.419" style="s2">several years so when I first arrived</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.529" end="00:28:14.980" style="s2">and this predates my arrival actually as</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.419" end="00:28:18.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve dropped our tuition fees</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.980" end="00:28:21.460" style="s2">considerably some 45% for UK students</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.610" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">and 30% for international students and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.460" end="00:28:28.019" style="s2">we&#39;ve already seen in our applicants and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:30.580" style="s2">our inquiries this year a much greater</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.019" end="00:28:32.860" style="s2">proportion of UK students interested in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.580" end="00:28:35.140" style="s2">the courses and I think that&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.860" end="00:28:36.610" style="s2">because of the tuition drop and because</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.140" end="00:28:39.220" style="s2">of you know they can come for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.610" end="00:28:41.110" style="s2">and then go back to their homes or you</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.220" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">know businesses or other lives for four</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.110" end="00:28:45.850" style="s2">weeks and engage in meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:48.309" style="s2">experience related to their studies and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.850" end="00:28:49.570" style="s2">then bring that experience back for when</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.309" end="00:28:53.049" style="s2">they come for the following two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.570" end="00:28:55.240" style="s2">learning cycle exactly exactly and all</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.049" end="00:28:56.620" style="s2">of them is inter woven come January with</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.240" end="00:28:59.769" style="s2">the other three courses that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.620" end="00:29:02.409" style="s2">launching and so holistic science will</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.769" end="00:29:04.389" style="s2">start in January and we took a hiatus</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.409" end="00:29:07.210" style="s2">from that this year but we&#39;re launching</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.389" end="00:29:08.820" style="s2">it again and let&#39;s hear that because</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.210" end="00:29:12.279" style="s2">there was for a while there was this</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.820" end="00:29:15.580" style="s2">kind of alarming conversation that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.279" end="00:29:17.590" style="s2">might just not run it again and so I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.580" end="00:29:21.029" style="s2">very excited I think it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.590" end="00:29:23.590" style="s2">a huge mistake to rhythm with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.029" end="00:29:26.860" style="s2">exactly well well we have adapted in</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.590" end="00:29:30.070" style="s2">some sense or brought it into the more</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.860" end="00:29:32.679" style="s2">into the 21st century you know by adding</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.070" end="00:29:34.750" style="s2">a couple of modules that engage with</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.679" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">more contemporary philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.750" end="00:29:39.460" style="s2">engagement with issues like post</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:41.409" style="s2">humanism and sort of really creative</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.460" end="00:29:44.019" style="s2">thinking about the human and more than</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.409" end="00:29:46.090" style="s2">human you know connections that can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.019" end="00:29:48.639" style="s2">made through looking at there&#39;s various</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.090" end="00:29:50.649" style="s2">scientific discourse and we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.639" end="00:29:53.110" style="s2">that in parallel actually with a new</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.649" end="00:29:57.429" style="s2">program that any lecture is lead on</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.110" end="00:30:00.820" style="s2">called engaged ecology which really is I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.429" end="00:30:03.940" style="s2">think I helped Andy a bit with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.820" end="00:30:06.580" style="s2">development of that program and it I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.940" end="00:30:08.789" style="s2">think it really sort of flips even more</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.580" end="00:30:12.010" style="s2">than that the traditional Schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.789" end="00:30:14.950" style="s2">program it flips sort of the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.010" end="00:30:16.990" style="s2">experience with the academic one even</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.950" end="00:30:18.520" style="s2">more on its head I mean really four</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.990" end="00:30:20.260" style="s2">grounds the idea of making at the very</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.520" end="00:30:22.660" style="s2">beginning and engage</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.260" end="00:30:24.700" style="s2">students in you know in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.660" end="00:30:26.710" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.700" end="00:30:28.360" style="s2">season if we run the course when we run</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.710" end="00:30:30.610" style="s2">the course again whether it&#39;s growing</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.360" end="00:30:32.860" style="s2">their own flax and and weaving a garment</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.610" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">out of that and using that as an entry</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.860" end="00:30:37.420" style="s2">into talking about textiles and talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:40.210" style="s2">about agriculture and agri-food tree and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.420" end="00:30:42.160" style="s2">anycall ecological systems or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.210" end="00:30:43.930" style="s2">carving a spoon and a bowl</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.160" end="00:30:45.700" style="s2">you know those very first week of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.930" end="00:30:48.520" style="s2">course you know to engage them in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.700" end="00:30:50.490" style="s2">sort of really tactile process of making</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.520" end="00:30:52.150" style="s2">that engages them again with</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.490" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">conversations about tradition</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.150" end="00:30:56.350" style="s2">conversations about the human and more</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.070" end="00:31:00.600" style="s2">than human connection and blurring those</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.350" end="00:31:02.800" style="s2">boundaries so I learn bookbinding in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.600" end="00:31:05.350" style="s2">doing the Masters and holistic science</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.800" end="00:31:06.820" style="s2">Mary Philip and the Craft Center doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.350" end="00:31:10.780" style="s2">her book binding workshops yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.820" end="00:31:12.910" style="s2">yeah books I made back then so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.780" end="00:31:15.070" style="s2">excited to run those two programs side</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.910" end="00:31:16.060" style="s2">by side starting in January I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.070" end="00:31:17.400" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.060" end="00:31:19.210" style="s2">interesting interweaving and</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.400" end="00:31:23.080" style="s2">collaboration possible there and those</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.210" end="00:31:26.710" style="s2">are but two fully residential courses</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.080" end="00:31:28.810" style="s2">that we&#39;re running mystic science will</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.710" end="00:31:30.790" style="s2">continue to be fully residential yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.810" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">this time around Italy yep yep and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.790" end="00:31:34.930" style="s2">we&#39;re running that straight through till</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">the end of June which is a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.930" end="00:31:38.200" style="s2">different timescale and I think for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:41.290" style="s2">first time we&#39;ll have those students</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.200" end="00:31:44.140" style="s2">overlapping with a horticulture</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.290" end="00:31:45.310" style="s2">residency program in in a longer way</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.140" end="00:31:47.380" style="s2">than they have in the past because</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.310" end="00:31:50.140" style="s2">typically there&#39;s been a couple days or</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.380" end="00:31:51.430" style="s2">a week or so of overlap in April but</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.140" end="00:31:53.230" style="s2">here the students will be here straight</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.430" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">through until summer which will be I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.230" end="00:31:56.140" style="s2">think it really differrent perience and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">then they leave and then they do them</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.140" end="00:32:01.240" style="s2">the thesis and then of course actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:02.680" style="s2">finishes in general kind of August or</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.240" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">something like that yeah also it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.680" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">convinced master&#39;s it&#39;s not a full year</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.500" style="s2">master&#39;s thing oh so now I would need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:15.610" style="s2">look up the dates to be really specific</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.500" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">so yeah check the website and and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.610" end="00:32:19.060" style="s2">it so what I&#39;m hearing is that to some</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:22.090" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.060" end="00:32:24.100" style="s2">the kovat situation only amplified</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.090" end="00:32:27.190" style="s2">something that was already going on</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.100" end="00:32:29.950" style="s2">which is where we need to be less</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.190" end="00:32:33.280" style="s2">residential and more blended learning</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.950" end="00:32:35.380" style="s2">and and and make it more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.280" end="00:32:37.960" style="s2">right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.380" end="00:32:40.780" style="s2">you know I look at a lot of through</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.960" end="00:32:42.340" style="s2">higher ed responses to Kovan and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.780" end="00:32:44.200" style="s2">of them say well we need to decrease our</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.340" end="00:32:45.490" style="s2">reliance on international students</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.200" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">because we&#39;re not going to have as many</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.490" end="00:32:48.400" style="s2">international students particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:50.530" style="s2">the UK in the u.s. that&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.400" end="00:32:51.460" style="s2">significant issue and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.530" end="00:32:53.470" style="s2">that we addressed</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.460" end="00:32:55.240" style="s2">not that we could fort you know foresee</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.470" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">the future but something we&#39;ve began to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.240" end="00:33:01.090" style="s2">address already a year ago and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:03.520" style="s2">think we are well positioned and so far</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.090" end="00:33:06.370" style="s2">the recruitment has been going you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.520" end="00:33:08.740" style="s2">as well as we can it be as well as can</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.370" end="00:33:10.090" style="s2">be expected and we&#39;re looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.740" end="00:33:12.010" style="s2">starting these courses as I&#39;ve laid out</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.090" end="00:33:13.810" style="s2">so I think things are looking really</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.010" end="00:33:15.640" style="s2">good one thing that they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.810" end="00:33:17.290" style="s2">suddenly felt compelled to do to give</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.640" end="00:33:24.190" style="s2">you a bit of history that you might have</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.290" end="00:33:28.750" style="s2">not heard of em is at some point must</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.190" end="00:33:31.150" style="s2">have been like after after left so Maha</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.750" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">um a few years later and moved to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.150" end="00:33:37.540" style="s2">Finland and lived at eco village in in</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:40.600" style="s2">Scotland and ran Finn home college at</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.540" end="00:33:43.960" style="s2">the time and together with a co-director</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.600" end="00:33:46.690" style="s2">Mary Hollander and my my job was really</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.960" end="00:33:48.520" style="s2">the designing new masters courses and</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.690" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">new new collaborations and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.520" end="00:33:53.080" style="s2">projects we were in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:56.350" style="s2">Schumacher at the time and Brian Goodwin</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:59.080" style="s2">was the lead on on that conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.350" end="00:34:01.240" style="s2">to create and I still think that would</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.080" end="00:34:02.920" style="s2">be a one a wonderful master&#39;s course to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.240" end="00:34:05.820" style="s2">offer in the UK I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.920" end="00:34:08.440" style="s2">my personal learning I always say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.820" end="00:34:11.340" style="s2">there were three places that really</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.440" end="00:34:15.170" style="s2">shaped the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.340" end="00:34:19.350" style="s2">cases of my work in in the time between</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.170" end="00:34:21.360" style="s2">1999 and 2003 and it wasn&#39;t it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.350" end="00:34:24.450" style="s2">basically my time at Yamaha initially</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.360" end="00:34:26.340" style="s2">but before that I was at the Center for</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.450" end="00:34:28.620" style="s2">alternative technology for a while doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.340" end="00:34:30.540" style="s2">short courses um and then afterwards the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.620" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2">fintan experience and I felt that each</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.540" end="00:34:36.210" style="s2">one of them while there they all have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:37.590" style="s2">certain overlap they have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.210" end="00:34:39.840" style="s2">slightly different centers of gravity</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.590" end="00:34:43.590" style="s2">and strengths in terms of what what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.840" end="00:34:46.790" style="s2">teach and in school in those like in</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.590" end="00:34:49.410" style="s2">2008 2009 there was this conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.790" end="00:34:51.960" style="s2">working with San Andres as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.410" end="00:34:53.730" style="s2">certifying University and then have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.960" end="00:34:57.030" style="s2">course weather where the students would</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.730" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">spend instead of induction at San Andres</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.030" end="00:35:03.480" style="s2">in they would have three residential</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">modules one at Omaha one a cap and one a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.480" end="00:35:08.940" style="s2">fin horn mmm I still think that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">would I mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.940" end="00:35:12.270" style="s2">bringing a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">organizations yeah one hat but but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.270" end="00:35:17.670" style="s2">would be a powerful course - it would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:19.290" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s one of the lessons</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.670" end="00:35:21.780" style="s2">that people are learning from our</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.290" end="00:35:24.620" style="s2">current situation as well that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.780" end="00:35:27.540" style="s2">a lot of networking and collaboration is</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.620" end="00:35:30.300" style="s2">almost going to be necessary to move</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.540" end="00:35:33.210" style="s2">forward and to create learning</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.300" end="00:35:34.770" style="s2">experiences for you know I think post</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.210" end="00:35:37.410" style="s2">graduate largely but also I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.770" end="00:35:38.460" style="s2">undergraduate students if possible at a</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.410" end="00:35:40.530" style="s2">lot of these international</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.460" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">collaborations and international</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.530" end="00:35:48.750" style="s2">university partnerships are becoming</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:50.610" style="s2">more and more popular to talk about you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.750" end="00:35:54.360" style="s2">know as being alternatives and being</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.610" end="00:35:55.650" style="s2">potential ways to if not preserve higher</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.360" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">education I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.650" end="00:36:01.950" style="s2">anybody is looking to do but - I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:03.330" style="s2">evolved higher education in directions I</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.950" end="00:36:05.070" style="s2">think that it needs to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.330" end="00:36:08.180" style="s2">you know given our current situation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.070" end="00:36:11.310" style="s2">a lot of that just makes sense you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.180" end="00:36:15.780" style="s2">one thing that I think Shuma has already</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.310" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">played a bit of a role in is this M we</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.780" end="00:36:21.410" style="s2">to my mind we need to really reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:23.720" style="s2">education from the ground up as as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.410" end="00:36:25.430" style="s2">lifelong journey rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.720" end="00:36:27.710" style="s2">as something that you do in the first</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.430" end="00:36:29.170" style="s2">third of your life and then you make</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.710" end="00:36:33.380" style="s2">some money with it and then you retired</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.170" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">and because of the offer that you maha</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.380" end="00:36:37.819" style="s2">has traditionally you&#39;ve always had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:40.010" style="s2">blend of young students and very mature</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.819" end="00:36:41.660" style="s2">students who might even like some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.010" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">them after retirement some of them in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.660" end="00:36:47.690" style="s2">change of career dropping out of the rat</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:50.920" style="s2">race and wanting to refocus and and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.690" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">think that&#39;s we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.920" end="00:36:58.280" style="s2">international partnerships or</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:37:01.190" style="s2">organizations that provide different</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.280" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">types of vocational and not formal and</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.190" end="00:37:07.819" style="s2">informal learning programs and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:10.190" style="s2">bring them together into a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.819" end="00:37:14.300" style="s2">not one major organization but a network</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.190" end="00:37:15.800" style="s2">of organizations that would enable I to</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.300" end="00:37:19.700" style="s2">basically the greater turn back</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.800" end="00:37:21.470" style="s2">generation when they the world is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.700" end="00:37:25.609" style="s2">changing so fast that to do a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.470" end="00:37:29.180" style="s2">traditional degree is a waste of money</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.609" end="00:37:31.400" style="s2">and time to some extent and I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.180" end="00:37:35.780" style="s2">been dreaming of this idea that all</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.400" end="00:37:39.619" style="s2">these leaders in alternative educational</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.780" end="00:37:41.750" style="s2">ecological holistic awareness education</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.619" end="00:37:43.940" style="s2">would come together with all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.750" end="00:37:46.700" style="s2">grassroots institutions of like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.940" end="00:37:49.670" style="s2">global permaculture training webs like</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.700" end="00:37:52.010" style="s2">networks and the agroforestry people and</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.670" end="00:37:54.109" style="s2">now ecosystems restoration camps as</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.010" end="00:37:58.010" style="s2">sites where you could do practical</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.109" end="00:38:00.970" style="s2">learning and create this the system</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.010" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">where students can build their own</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.970" end="00:38:07.369" style="s2">four-year journey and Edward Miller from</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:09.050" style="s2">from the University of international</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.369" end="00:38:11.930" style="s2">cooperation in Costa Rica gave me this</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.050" end="00:38:13.339" style="s2">other piece in this puzzle because he</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.930" end="00:38:16.849" style="s2">was thinking of something very similar</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.339" end="00:38:18.260" style="s2">and he said yeah I I agree with you and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.849" end="00:38:18.950" style="s2">I had this idea that people would have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.260" end="00:38:22.069" style="s2">passport</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.950" end="00:38:23.630" style="s2">that basically the students would build</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.069" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2">their own program take these different</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.630" end="00:38:27.410" style="s2">courses some of them would be online so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">you could maybe do a guy education</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.410" end="00:38:31.069" style="s2">design for sustainability cause while</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:33.980" style="s2">you were in an ecosystems restoration</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.069" end="00:38:37.190" style="s2">camp because they they were together and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.980" end="00:38:39.530" style="s2">um and then each organization stamps</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.190" end="00:38:42.200" style="s2">X units and all you&#39;d have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.530" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">validate the the different units against</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.200" end="00:38:47.720" style="s2">each other so after in in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">complexity after four years then</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.720" end="00:38:53.839" style="s2">everybody together certifies and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:55.490" style="s2">would my mind it would create graduates</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.839" end="00:38:57.079" style="s2">that might have done a man violent</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.490" end="00:38:59.569" style="s2">communication in the socio cracy</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.079" end="00:39:01.490" style="s2">training and then in agra forestry</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.569" end="00:39:05.060" style="s2">training and then spend some time at shu</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.490" end="00:39:08.540" style="s2">maha doing a masters or a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.060" end="00:39:10.460" style="s2">residential courses and i think you they</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.540" end="00:39:12.770" style="s2">would be so much more employable and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.460" end="00:39:15.140" style="s2">much more multi skilled and full human</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.770" end="00:39:16.609" style="s2">development than a normal academic</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.140" end="00:39:17.960" style="s2">courses well i think you&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.609" end="00:39:19.940" style="s2">those are exactly some of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.960" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">conversations that we&#39;re having you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.940" end="00:39:24.710" style="s2">it speaks to the experience that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:26.869" style="s2">had back in the states of working on</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.710" end="00:39:28.819" style="s2">bioregional higher education networks</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.869" end="00:39:31.099" style="s2">you know in the northeast for example</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.819" end="00:39:33.650" style="s2">looking at now I think there were some</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.099" end="00:39:36.050" style="s2">28 or 30 universities in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.650" end="00:39:38.950" style="s2">northeastern us in what we called the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.050" end="00:39:41.810" style="s2">northern forest region but as contiguous</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.950" end="00:39:44.510" style="s2">boreal forest trends transition zone and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.810" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">you know it worked well to think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.510" end="00:39:49.880" style="s2">that as a unified by region because of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">its sort of cultural economic you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.880" end="00:39:53.930" style="s2">ecological you know interconnections and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:57.470" style="s2">I think exactly what you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.930" end="00:39:59.630" style="s2">could happen anywhere in the world you</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.470" end="00:40:03.710" style="s2">know and I quite like the bio regional</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.630" end="00:40:05.390" style="s2">model because it emphasizes all of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.710" end="00:40:08.839" style="s2">interconnections that I think Schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.390" end="00:40:10.520" style="s2">you know sees as being essential between</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.839" end="00:40:13.730" style="s2">human and not human and more than human</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.520" end="00:40:15.349" style="s2">communities and so on and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.730" end="00:40:17.990" style="s2">impediments to something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.349" end="00:40:19.040" style="s2">know are obviously vast you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.990" end="00:40:20.839" style="s2">particularly as we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.040" end="00:40:23.210" style="s2">international partnerships and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.839" end="00:40:24.890" style="s2">cooperation and validation and so on</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.210" end="00:40:27.650" style="s2">but I think that it&#39;s really essential</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.890" end="00:40:29.450" style="s2">as we move forward in you know even the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.650" end="00:40:31.700" style="s2">next couple of years I mean certainly</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.450" end="00:40:34.280" style="s2">over the five and 10-year horizon that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.700" end="00:40:37.099" style="s2">higher education absolutely has</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.280" end="00:40:40.069" style="s2">tremendous challenges about the you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.099" end="00:40:43.609" style="s2">regarding access regarding sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.069" end="00:40:46.130" style="s2">equity regarding for shared experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.609" end="00:40:49.819" style="s2">of students and you know whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.130" end="00:40:51.020" style="s2">we&#39;re providing for you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.819" end="00:40:52.820" style="s2">really talk about higher education</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.020" end="00:40:54.710" style="s2">universally but whether higher education</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.820" end="00:40:56.930" style="s2">is providing students with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.710" end="00:40:59.030" style="s2">experiences that they actually need or</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.930" end="00:41:00.920" style="s2">that are useful for them or are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.030" end="00:41:02.540" style="s2">what they&#39;re looking for so I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.920" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">there needs to be all sorts of flexible</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.540" end="00:41:06.200" style="s2">opportunities that could be</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:07.520" style="s2">intergenerational one is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.200" end="00:41:09.740" style="s2">essential I think Schumacher does that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.520" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">quite well I think we could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.740" end="00:41:14.390" style="s2">integrate even more of that into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:16.460" style="s2">living and learning communities that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.390" end="00:41:18.230" style="s2">might be intergenerational I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.460" end="00:41:19.820" style="s2">they&#39;re incredible opportunities and now</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.230" end="00:41:22.510" style="s2">is really the time to begin having those</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.820" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">conversations and it&#39;s I think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.510" end="00:41:27.590" style="s2">because so many institutions like</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:29.840" style="s2">Schumacher for example is now at an a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.590" end="00:41:32.360" style="s2">they&#39;re now at an age where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.840" end="00:41:34.100" style="s2">created their own track record it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.360" end="00:41:37.850" style="s2">like in the beginning it was this</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.100" end="00:41:39.710" style="s2">experimental innovative educational</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.850" end="00:41:42.440" style="s2">institute that really had to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.710" end="00:41:46.550" style="s2">look up to a certifying university and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.440" end="00:41:48.290" style="s2">almost beg them to get on to focus and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.550" end="00:41:51.530" style="s2">now I think it&#39;s the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.290" end="00:41:53.710" style="s2">almost you the world&#39;s moved on to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.530" end="00:41:57.460" style="s2">point that more and more people and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.710" end="00:42:00.590" style="s2">employers also very clearly say</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.460" end="00:42:02.270" style="s2">university degrees many people have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.590" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">mouth they don&#39;t speak to us I want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.270" end="00:42:07.220" style="s2">see something slightly different here</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:09.800" style="s2">and so I think the big opportunity is is</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.220" end="00:42:13.640" style="s2">that higher education also has a long</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.800" end="00:42:16.010" style="s2">track record now and Gaia University and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.640" end="00:42:17.840" style="s2">all these the network are connected to</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.010" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">the e-commerce ities network that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.840" end="00:42:23.660" style="s2">build our only informally and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.440" end="00:42:26.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of players that were</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.660" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">considered very unconventional and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.060" end="00:42:31.760" style="s2">by some universities not proper</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:34.010" style="s2">universities and and I I feel now the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.760" end="00:42:36.980" style="s2">first mover advantage will be to not</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.010" end="00:42:39.910" style="s2">even try to get certified by these</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.980" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">national systems to just have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.910" end="00:42:46.910" style="s2">confidence to say we together as a body</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:50.450" style="s2">of organizations that have together not</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.910" end="00:42:53.110" style="s2">track-record say this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.450" end="00:42:56.090" style="s2">educational program that this person has</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.110" end="00:42:59.030" style="s2">gone through and and and we can vouch</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.090" end="00:43:01.880" style="s2">for the quality of their abilities and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.030" end="00:43:04.049" style="s2">all right exactly you know it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.880" end="00:43:05.609" style="s2">as for creating a certificate program</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.049" end="00:43:07.949" style="s2">effectively and saying that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.609" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">completed this course at Schumacher and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.949" end="00:43:12.299" style="s2">to a lot of people that that means a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.130" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be an</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.299" end="00:43:18.089" style="s2">official degree and you know that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.130" end="00:43:19.319" style="s2">of the reasons that we have increased</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.089" end="00:43:21.739" style="s2">the number of short courses that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.319" end="00:43:25.019" style="s2">offering because that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.739" end="00:43:27.179" style="s2">tangible way and a fairly accessible way</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.019" end="00:43:28.799" style="s2">for a lot of students to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.179" end="00:43:32.069" style="s2">experience the type of learning that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.799" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">offer in different areas and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.069" end="00:43:35.809" style="s2">easy and relatively low-risk for us to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:40.199" style="s2">offer we don&#39;t need to partner with</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.809" end="00:43:41.729" style="s2">another organization and we can create</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.199" end="00:43:43.829" style="s2">really accessible content for people</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.729" end="00:43:45.089" style="s2">just very briefly I wanted to come back</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.829" end="00:43:47.819" style="s2">to the bioregion thing because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.089" end="00:43:50.459" style="s2">like what I&#39;ve noticed in my work I</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.819" end="00:43:52.589" style="s2">spend a lot of time focused on community</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.459" end="00:43:54.839" style="s2">scales how do you build sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.589" end="00:43:57.689" style="s2">communities I&#39;ve written most of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.839" end="00:43:59.309" style="s2">curriculum for guy education and design</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.689" end="00:44:01.529" style="s2">for sustainability course which was</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.309" end="00:44:03.420" style="s2">really initially the online version of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.529" end="00:44:04.679" style="s2">the eco village design education program</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.420" end="00:44:07.709" style="s2">focused on building sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.679" end="00:44:09.209" style="s2">communities but and then also lots of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.709" end="00:44:11.849" style="s2">work with what the different transition</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.209" end="00:44:15.269" style="s2">turns up at forests and and I I realized</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.849" end="00:44:17.489" style="s2">that my community is centrally important</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.269" end="00:44:20.219" style="s2">the to really create a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.489" end="00:44:22.920" style="s2">system that that includes the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.219" end="00:44:25.199" style="s2">of human expression and and also needs</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.920" end="00:44:27.179" style="s2">you really have to do the whole system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.199" end="00:44:30.839" style="s2">design at the bioregional scale the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.179" end="00:44:34.259" style="s2">scale is just too small and and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.839" end="00:44:36.209" style="s2">happened in the year from the US and yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.259" end="00:44:39.059" style="s2">that there are pockets the Vermont area</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.209" end="00:44:43.289" style="s2">being one and sort of Arkansas area</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.059" end="00:44:45.420" style="s2">another in over yeah Cascadia and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.289" end="00:44:48.449" style="s2">west coast our pockets are strong by a</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.420" end="00:44:53.809" style="s2">regional initiatives did some of them go</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.449" end="00:44:56.429" style="s2">back by now 50 years but in the last</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.809" end="00:44:59.609" style="s2">five or ten years I feel lots of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.429" end="00:45:02.189" style="s2">organizations are converging on</p>

<p begin="00:48:37.120" end="00:48:42.700" style="s2">together and I mean this long journey of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.880" end="00:48:44.650" style="s2">starting estate selling of assets around</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.700" end="00:48:46.810" style="s2">outside of the estate and shrinking down</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.650" end="00:48:49.210" style="s2">to the coif state over the last well</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.810" end="00:48:53.320" style="s2">since it started and the last 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.210" end="00:48:56.230" style="s2">really yeah how are they doing is there</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.320" end="00:48:59.770" style="s2">is there a need for any and well-meaning</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.230" end="00:49:01.930" style="s2">philanthropists listening to this I I</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.770" end="00:49:05.530" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s there&#39;s still quite a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.930" end="00:49:07.270" style="s2">economic need to finance this well I</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.530" end="00:49:08.740" style="s2">think there always is and I know as you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.270" end="00:49:12.490" style="s2">described yourself you know higher</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.740" end="00:49:15.220" style="s2">education specifically itself isn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.490" end="00:49:18.310" style="s2">know isn&#39;t necessarily a massive revenue</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.220" end="00:49:19.290" style="s2">generating Enterprise so you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.310" end="00:49:20.860" style="s2">devoting</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.290" end="00:49:24.550" style="s2">Dartington is a mission-driven</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.860" end="00:49:27.060" style="s2">organization as is Schumacher and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.550" end="00:49:29.290" style="s2">know Dartington has recently</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.060" end="00:49:32.770" style="s2">reinvented itself as a center for</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.290" end="00:49:35.260" style="s2">learning and so if everything at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.770" end="00:49:37.990" style="s2">estate is in support of the type of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.260" end="00:49:39.820" style="s2">learning that happens at Schumacher then</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.990" end="00:49:42.360" style="s2">I think we&#39;re going to see fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.820" end="00:49:44.790" style="s2">things in the coming years in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.360" end="00:49:46.950" style="s2">you know lots of opportunities to use</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.790" end="00:49:48.540" style="s2">the resources of the estates for</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.950" end="00:49:50.430" style="s2">Schumacher courses and for the art</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.540" end="00:49:53.190" style="s2">school courses and short courses and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.430" end="00:49:56.130" style="s2">on all of the buildings all the spaces a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.190" end="00:50:01.020" style="s2">lot of greater engagement with the land</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.130" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">we are launching a master&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.020" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">regenerative food farming and enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:08.490" style="s2">next autumn as well as a BSC and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:10.740" style="s2">sustainable food and farming so really</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.490" end="00:50:11.940" style="s2">actively engaging with that as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.740" end="00:50:13.770" style="s2">increase the number of students we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.940" end="00:50:16.830" style="s2">looking to increase the production of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.770" end="00:50:18.840" style="s2">the farm so right now we produce about</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.830" end="00:50:20.760" style="s2">50 percent of all the veg we consume at</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.840" end="00:50:22.830" style="s2">the college and you know my hope is to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.760" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">keep it at that 50 percent level as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.830" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">continue to move forward and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:28.500" style="s2">significant investment as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:30.990" style="s2">think there&#39;s a refocusing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.500" end="00:50:34.340" style="s2">happening at starting to to really</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.990" end="00:50:37.590" style="s2">emphasize these these core purposes of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.340" end="00:50:40.800" style="s2">you know really focusing on social</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.590" end="00:50:43.170" style="s2">justice on community on ecology on arts</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:44.850" style="s2">all under the rubric of learning and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.170" end="00:50:46.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a really exciting time to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.850" end="00:50:48.030" style="s2">thinking about well let&#39;s look at this</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.260" end="00:50:50.130" style="s2">estate and how we can use all of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.030" end="00:50:53.430" style="s2">resources to help support of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.130" end="00:50:55.460" style="s2">going on so and what I mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.430" end="00:51:00.890" style="s2">amazing I mean just to drop a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.460" end="00:51:03.270" style="s2">ideas here one one thought would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.890" end="00:51:05.640" style="s2">partnerships with ecosystems restoration</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.270" end="00:51:08.280" style="s2">comes in in the Netherlands because</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.640" end="00:51:10.650" style="s2">they&#39;ve increasingly experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.280" end="00:51:12.630" style="s2">these pop-up ecosystem restoration comes</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.650" end="00:51:15.870" style="s2">and Dartington could just like if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.630" end="00:51:19.500" style="s2">wanted to develop one particular field</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.870" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">into a different type of production you</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.500" end="00:51:24.780" style="s2">could actually use a four week or six</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:27.360" style="s2">week ecosystems restoration camp</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.780" end="00:51:29.460" style="s2">partnership with with the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.360" end="00:51:31.400" style="s2">because I&#39;m on the Advisory Council of</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.460" end="00:51:35.010" style="s2">the foundation that&#39;s why I&#39;m weave</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.400" end="00:51:36.390" style="s2">possible collaborations here I think it</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.010" end="00:51:40.370" style="s2">could be a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.390" end="00:51:42.600" style="s2">opportunity to bring I think you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.370" end="00:51:44.100" style="s2">build that partnership the other the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.600" end="00:51:45.560" style="s2">other partnership that could be</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.100" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">interesting is with since you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.560" end="00:51:50.940" style="s2">renamed Jonathan&#39;s master&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:52.200" style="s2">regenerative economics and assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.940" end="00:51:55.190" style="s2">you&#39;re probably reaching out to John</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.200" end="00:51:59.400" style="s2">Fullerton and okay Dre Wirth is already</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.190" end="00:52:01.620" style="s2">teaching on it and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.400" end="00:52:03.570" style="s2">regenerative communities network that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.620" end="00:52:06.660" style="s2">was born out of the capital Institute</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.570" end="00:52:11.190" style="s2">has a strong by a regional focus and has</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.660" end="00:52:12.750" style="s2">very interesting groups in the u.s. one</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.190" end="00:52:15.600" style="s2">in Vermont one in the Hudson Valley when</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.750" end="00:52:18.270" style="s2">but but also in Costa Rica and in other</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.600" end="00:52:20.520" style="s2">places in the world and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.270" end="00:52:21.720" style="s2">like that by regional program we just</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.520" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">talked about they there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.720" end="00:52:25.890" style="s2">really interesting partnership between</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:28.770" style="s2">the capital Institute and and the</p>

<p begin="00:52:28.770" end="00:52:35.220" style="s2">something for Devon but something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.780" end="00:52:36.930" style="s2">could actually possibly be associated</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.220" end="00:52:39.030" style="s2">with both of those institutions but</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.930" end="00:52:43.290" style="s2">offer on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.030" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">blended learning in like the</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:47.940" style="s2">were talking about yeah so I apologize</p>
