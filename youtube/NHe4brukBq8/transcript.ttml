<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">access you had to Facebook and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">Jacques and his management team did you</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:22.470" style="s2">sure so I wanted to write this book</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.630" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">beginning I think in 2015 I I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.470" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">pinpoint the date I think was August</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.700" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">27th 2015</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">when Zuckerberg posted a billion people</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">were online in the previous 24 hours on</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.490" style="s2">Facebook and that had never happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">before you get a billion people for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.490" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">World Cup that&#39;s people just watching</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:43.770" style="s2">something there are members of anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">they can&#39;t talk to each other and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.770" end="00:02:47.640" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a spike this was a baseline</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">Facebook was only going to grow I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.640" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">been covering Facebook for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:55.860" style="s2">years beginning when it was just the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">college network and it struck me that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.860" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">Zuckerberg very ambitious plans were on</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:02.850" style="s2">the way to being fulfilled and I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:05.520" style="s2">to document that and the way I do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:07.710" style="s2">you mentioned the Google book is to dive</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.520" end="00:03:11.130" style="s2">in there and learn everything I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.710" end="00:03:13.650" style="s2">about this so you know if I were doing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.130" end="00:03:16.020" style="s2">book without cooperation from Facebook I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:18.180" style="s2">talked to a lot of people outside the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.020" end="00:03:22.500" style="s2">company I try to talk to people inside</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:24.270" style="s2">the company away from the campus and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.500" end="00:03:26.550" style="s2">know people have opinions about it so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.270" end="00:03:28.920" style="s2">did a lot of stuff that you do when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.550" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">don&#39;t place doesn&#39;t cooperate but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.920" end="00:03:35.640" style="s2">talked them into cooperating with me on</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">the record officially um you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.640" end="00:03:40.590" style="s2">of in exchange they didn&#39;t get anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">from me I didn&#39;t show them the book till</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.590" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">after was printed all the trees were</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:47.160" style="s2">dead and it was too late to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">about it so that was just a pure gain</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.160" end="00:03:52.980" style="s2">for me and I told them then someone has</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">to do this someone has to document this</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.980" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">historical ascent of this company even</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:01.050" style="s2">if it isn&#39;t me it should be someone but</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">it should be me and they knew who I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.050" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">from my track record and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">covering Facebook and they knew me to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:11.820" style="s2">trustworthy they knew going in there</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">that there would probably be stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.820" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">there that they didn&#39;t like they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:17.850" style="s2">anticipate that a few months after I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:21.030" style="s2">started writing the book Facebook would</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.850" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">be thrust into a trajectory that put it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.030" end="00:04:25.710" style="s2">in crisis and exposed a lot of their</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">misdeeds which of course I documented in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.710" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">detail but</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:33.690" style="s2">I kept my implicit promise to be fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:36.480" style="s2">and delivered a book which I think tells</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.690" end="00:04:38.100" style="s2">the story of Facebook Wow and as far as</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.480" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">I know nobody else has ever had this</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.100" end="00:04:42.420" style="s2">level of access I&#39;ve read some other</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">books about Facebook and articles and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.420" end="00:04:48.270" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the sense of I was there</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.960" end="00:04:50.430" style="s2">like this one does yeah particularly</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.270" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">when you try to get to know an enigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.430" end="00:04:57.230" style="s2">character like Zuckerberg he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">trust people very easily so it really</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.230" end="00:05:04.680" style="s2">takes a long time for him to be candid</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:06.450" style="s2">with someone and remarkably the best two</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.680" end="00:05:08.640" style="s2">interviews I wound up doing with him</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.450" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">ever were the last two interviews I did</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.640" end="00:05:14.220" style="s2">in the book when I was already writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">the book this is in 2019 where I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.220" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">able to ask him questions that normally</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.510" style="s2">he would walk out of the room if he got</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">from someone but he knew because I knew</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.510" end="00:05:25.470" style="s2">the company so well that he had to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:28.040" style="s2">grapple with it and he had to give me</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.470" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">the answers as much for himself as to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.040" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">very good we will kind of weave through</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">this to the grid that I can you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:37.260" style="s2">your insights into the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:39.690" style="s2">Zuckerberg and he&#39;s obviously a world</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.260" end="00:05:41.370" style="s2">historical person and I suspect you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.690" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">as much insight on him as anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.370" end="00:05:47.100" style="s2">isn&#39;t his family let&#39;s start with in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">book early on you dig into Zuckerberg</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.100" end="00:05:52.590" style="s2">denial of the impact that Facebook may</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">be either had or didn&#39;t have in 2016</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.730" end="00:06:04.920" style="s2">sense it&#39;s the book unfolds that seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.530" end="00:06:07.170" style="s2">to be a pivotal moment when Zuckerberg</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.550" end="00:06:14.460" style="s2">Facebook became disconnected from the</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.460" end="00:06:18.780" style="s2">and perhaps the duties of Facebook you</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.780" end="00:06:24.630" style="s2">changed as you point out investigations</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:46.710" style="s2">in one day but the election exposed and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.250" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">made it difficult to ignore the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.710" end="00:06:51.629" style="s2">about Facebook which were worrisome</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:54.090" style="s2">I think if Donald Trump wasn&#39;t elected</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.629" end="00:06:55.169" style="s2">president this reckoning might not have</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.090" end="00:06:57.960" style="s2">happened there it certainly wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.169" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">have happened at this time you know as I</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.960" end="00:07:03.629" style="s2">get into in the book there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:06.900" style="s2">events where people called out Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.629" end="00:07:11.069" style="s2">for privacy violations for being</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.900" end="00:07:14.280" style="s2">cavalier about the content on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.069" end="00:07:16.199" style="s2">network all sorts of things but they</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.280" end="00:07:19.319" style="s2">managed to skate by it and not really</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.199" end="00:07:20.819" style="s2">pay the price for when it went wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.319" end="00:07:23.159" style="s2">figured he can kind of go along and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.819" end="00:07:26.190" style="s2">apologize for what it did wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.159" end="00:07:28.500" style="s2">going along in its merry way but after</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.190" end="00:07:30.690" style="s2">the election people took a closer look</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.500" end="00:07:33.780" style="s2">at what happened on Facebook than what</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.690" end="00:07:35.190" style="s2">was happening on Facebook and became</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.780" end="00:07:37.620" style="s2">less forgiving about it because they</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.190" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">realized what an impact it had now that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.620" end="00:07:41.490" style="s2">particular statement by Zuckerberg came</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:42.870" style="s2">in a conference two days after the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.490" end="00:07:45.539" style="s2">election I was in the room when he said</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.870" end="00:07:47.789" style="s2">it and it really didn&#39;t level the room</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.539" end="00:07:51.449" style="s2">to say when he said it&#39;s crazy to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.789" end="00:07:54.750" style="s2">that we affected the election people</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.449" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">were still digesting it but what I only</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.750" end="00:07:59.279" style="s2">learned later was the day before that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:01.169" style="s2">there was a big meeting at Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.279" end="00:08:02.880" style="s2">impede were in tears and they were one</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.169" end="00:08:06.690" style="s2">day asking themselves did we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.880" end="00:08:10.919" style="s2">anything to do with that so in a way he</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.690" end="00:08:13.469" style="s2">wasn&#39;t dealing totally candidly when he</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.919" end="00:08:16.409" style="s2">brushed it off because he knew from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.469" end="00:08:18.449" style="s2">reaction of his own employees that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.409" end="00:08:20.789" style="s2">was a concern about this at that point</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.449" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">and that same shock that the public had</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.789" end="00:08:24.509" style="s2">after Trump got elected and they said</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:25.949" style="s2">well what about a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.509" end="00:08:27.659" style="s2">happened on Facebook that I&#39;ve been you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.949" end="00:08:30.569" style="s2">do with it that was a question that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.659" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">being asked in Menlo Park and the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.569" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">Facebook offices by Facebook employees</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:38.909" style="s2">indeed it&#39;s interesting to my mind that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:40.620" style="s2">that highlighted to me what I took as</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.909" end="00:08:41.909" style="s2">sort of an implicit theme of your book</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.620" end="00:08:44.310" style="s2">which I don&#39;t think ever quite made it</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.909" end="00:08:47.010" style="s2">explicit which was that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:48.930" style="s2">Facebook started out in that era that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.010" end="00:08:50.550" style="s2">was kind of congruent with the hacker</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.930" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">culture you know spirit of doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.550" end="00:08:55.269" style="s2">something outrageous but useful you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:57.130" style="s2">the noses of the powers-that-be which</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.269" end="00:08:58.899" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about a little bit later how</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.130" end="00:09:02.649" style="s2">Zuckerberg kind of got sideways with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.899" end="00:09:06.130" style="s2">admin at Harvard very slowly climbed a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.649" end="00:09:07.450" style="s2">ramp in this hacker spirit and if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.130" end="00:09:09.399" style="s2">think back you know you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.450" end="00:09:11.649" style="s2">old-timers we go back to the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.399" end="00:09:13.420" style="s2">days of the online world I worked at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.649" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">source which was the very first consumer</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.420" end="00:09:20.380" style="s2">online service from 1980 to 1982 yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">was on this world yeah I was TC a zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:25.420" style="s2">eight zero that&#39;s how early I was and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:27.029" style="s2">you know if we recall you know how the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.420" end="00:09:30.130" style="s2">evolution of the considered</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.029" end="00:09:32.649" style="s2">responsibility of these platforms in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.130" end="00:09:34.570" style="s2">80s we had services like CompuServe you</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.649" end="00:09:36.430" style="s2">know the source I quit after two years</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.570" end="00:09:38.139" style="s2">Reader&#39;s Digest had bought it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.430" end="00:09:40.089" style="s2">stifled it and just didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.139" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">what they had I up and quit and became</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.089" end="00:09:43.750" style="s2">an entrepreneur I&#39;m quite a successful</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">one using the technologies to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:48.850" style="s2">information into professional audiences</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">but the consumer online world you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.850" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2">took off at a fairly good pace</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:55.959" style="s2">CompuServe by the mid-80s had millions</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:58.690" style="s2">of users and at the time the ruling law</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.959" end="00:10:01.110" style="s2">was a case called cubby vs. CompuServe</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.690" end="00:10:04.089" style="s2">such as a court decision which basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.110" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">entirely let copy serve off the hook for</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.089" end="00:10:08.199" style="s2">what happened there so long as it did</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:10.630" style="s2">not do any moderating which is quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.199" end="00:10:12.459" style="s2">interesting and that was the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.630" end="00:10:14.050" style="s2">both of the legal framework and what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.459" end="00:10:16.930" style="s2">might call you know the hacker</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.050" end="00:10:20.140" style="s2">Sensibility which is hey these platforms</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.930" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">are to allow people to get together and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.140" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">talk and you know the biggest thing on</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:26.110" style="s2">CompuServe were things called SIG&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">special interest groups kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.110" end="00:10:30.459" style="s2">combination of a forum and a software</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">repository and some other little</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.459" end="00:10:34.329" style="s2">features like they eventually had chat</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:36.730" style="s2">built into him and their multi-user chat</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.329" end="00:10:39.699" style="s2">so again CompuServe was really about</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.730" end="00:10:42.069" style="s2">interaction they saw that way on but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.699" end="00:10:44.230" style="s2">ethos at that time was not their problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.069" end="00:10:49.500" style="s2">what gets said on that platform then</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.230" end="00:10:52.300" style="s2">later 1996 after a lot of lobbying and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.500" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">conversation on Capitol Hill and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.300" end="00:10:56.410" style="s2">know I still remember a lot of that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:59.410" style="s2">know an organization I was think member</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.410" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">number seven of the EF F had a role in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.410" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">this as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:05.019" style="s2">the famous section 230 of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:06.940" style="s2">Communications Decency Act which</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.019" end="00:11:09.490" style="s2">basically gave platforms</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.940" end="00:11:11.670" style="s2">AOL at that time was still relatively</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:14.860" style="s2">big and various other players</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.670" end="00:11:17.170" style="s2">essentially immunity from what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.860" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">people on their platform said even if</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.170" end="00:11:22.630" style="s2">they did do moderation yeah that was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:26.200" style="s2">key that you know I worked for Newsweek</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.630" end="00:11:28.660" style="s2">for twelve years I was a chief</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.200" end="00:11:30.790" style="s2">technology writer and I remember I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.660" end="00:11:33.940" style="s2">actually fairly recently gotten in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.790" end="00:11:36.550" style="s2">Newsweek then interviewed Al Gore the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.940" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">night that passed you know I was writing</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.550" end="00:11:40.180" style="s2">about it for Newsweek and and we and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:44.350" style="s2">talked about it and that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.180" end="00:11:46.270" style="s2">basically gave the platforms the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.350" end="00:11:48.580" style="s2">to do some moderation as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.270" end="00:11:50.770" style="s2">it was here before it was binary either</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.580" end="00:11:53.950" style="s2">you hands-off and you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.770" end="00:11:55.960" style="s2">responsible or if you mess with it then</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.950" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">they could sue you and say well yeah hey</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.960" end="00:11:59.470" style="s2">you were moderating so you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:01.720" style="s2">responsible so now they were able to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.470" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">hey we can take out things like hate</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.720" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">speech or you know or threats or</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:08.410" style="s2">whatever you know to make it a safer</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:10.540" style="s2">environment for people and still not be</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.410" end="00:12:13.450" style="s2">responsible for vetting it like an</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.540" end="00:12:14.980" style="s2">editor and Wired would that a story to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.450" end="00:12:17.740" style="s2">make sure that we don&#39;t get sued because</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.980" end="00:12:19.930" style="s2">we are responsible for our content if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.740" end="00:12:22.060" style="s2">libel someone in an article in Wired we</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.930" end="00:12:25.870" style="s2">have to Ansel for it not if you post</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.060" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">something on AOL you know or later</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.870" end="00:12:33.160" style="s2">Facebook so Facebook was a child of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.160" end="00:12:37.720" style="s2">guess my point is that was the ethos of</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.480" end="00:13:37.240" style="s2">and they sat around and and just made</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:41.260" style="s2">some informal rules it was almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.240" end="00:13:43.300" style="s2">you know an ad-hoc agreement and when</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.260" end="00:13:47.170" style="s2">you signed on as a new employee to do</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.500" end="00:14:04.120" style="s2">the formal rules they eventually evolved</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.040" end="00:14:05.620" style="s2">into what&#39;s now like a 37 page set of</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.770" end="00:14:13.450" style="s2">which gets up more detail but that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.080" end="00:14:40.780" style="s2">I thought that was actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.250" end="00:14:43.780" style="s2">interesting how it was essentially a</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.650" end="00:14:51.130" style="s2">back a little bit to the history of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.240" end="00:14:54.670" style="s2">command again there were millions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.130" end="00:14:56.500" style="s2">people on CompuServe AOL even the well</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.670" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t have millions but had you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.500" end="00:14:59.620" style="s2">over ten thousand at its peak you and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:02.050" style="s2">have both been a member of the well for</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:05.170" style="s2">a long time there didn&#39;t seem to be so</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.050" end="00:15:07.270" style="s2">much concern about so-called bad things</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.170" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">I mean there were some bad things on</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.270" end="00:15:12.220" style="s2">CompuServe way back in the day and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:14.140" style="s2">CompuServe view on it was oh well we</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.220" end="00:15:15.880" style="s2">don&#39;t care not our job and the source</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.140" end="00:15:18.070" style="s2">right where I work so I was more aware</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.880" end="00:15:21.490" style="s2">of how we did it again it was hands-off</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.070" end="00:15:23.470" style="s2">with respect to content but because it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.490" end="00:15:25.540" style="s2">was owned by The Reader&#39;s Digest oddly</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.470" end="00:15:28.810" style="s2">they were extraordinarily persnickety</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.540" end="00:15:30.340" style="s2">about George Carlin&#39;s obscene words and</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.340" end="00:15:34.130" style="s2">say fuck right in fact I got a big</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.010" end="00:16:04.040" style="s2">had you know classic old-school fuss the</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.040" end="00:16:09.590" style="s2">that could be used and so why did it why</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.980" end="00:16:12.170" style="s2">does it make a difference today that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.590" end="00:16:16.280" style="s2">should suppress hate speech say when it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.170" end="00:16:18.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t in say 1982 so this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.280" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">the the benefit of going back and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.110" end="00:16:23.000" style="s2">looking over the the history of company</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">how it evolved so the the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.000" end="00:16:28.790" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t such you know an alarming</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:30.860" style="s2">thing in the source or CompuServe or</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.790" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">whatever is that there was no equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.860" end="00:16:38.180" style="s2">of going viral on those things you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:41.030" style="s2">Facebook built in the tools to allow</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.180" end="00:16:44.180" style="s2">certain kind of posts just to percolate</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.030" end="00:16:46.310" style="s2">like and this is a horrible comparison</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.180" end="00:16:48.980" style="s2">for time right now like a like a virus</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.310" end="00:16:50.270" style="s2">right and you know one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.980" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">product initiatives actually named</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.270" end="00:16:53.810" style="s2">pandemic of Facebook&#39;s the name one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.730" style="s2">the chapters of my book that I wrote way</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.810" end="00:16:57.890" style="s2">before this happened mmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.730" end="00:16:59.810" style="s2">Facebook thought that was great because</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.890" end="00:17:03.320" style="s2">Facebook was really obsessed with growth</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.810" end="00:17:05.449" style="s2">and things like that got people on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.320" end="00:17:07.939" style="s2">platform and and drew them in there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.449" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">had more time there was great for growth</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.939" end="00:17:12.740" style="s2">and retention so when things started</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:15.470" style="s2">going viral on Facebook which happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.740" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">because they would distribute posts they</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.470" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">drank them higher on your newsfeed if</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">more people were engaging with it as</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:26.930" style="s2">precisely people you knew you know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:28.610" style="s2">allowed things to get huge audiences of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.930" end="00:17:30.050" style="s2">millions and millions of people and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.610" end="00:17:32.600" style="s2">businesses cropped up to take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.050" end="00:17:34.280" style="s2">of that the Arab Spring took advantage</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.600" end="00:17:36.740" style="s2">of that and Facebook thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.280" end="00:17:38.450" style="s2">terrific that&#39;s fantastic and never</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.740" end="00:17:42.410" style="s2">really seriously consider the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.450" end="00:17:45.800" style="s2">consequences of the destructive content</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.410" end="00:17:47.960" style="s2">being distributed widely and going viral</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.800" end="00:17:49.510" style="s2">on Facebook or and why</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.960" end="00:17:53.570" style="s2">was more likely to go viral on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.510" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">then content which was upstanding and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.570" end="00:17:58.039" style="s2">well researched so this was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:17:59.720" style="s2">consequence that at first they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.039" end="00:18:01.850" style="s2">think of and then was called to their</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.720" end="00:18:04.789" style="s2">attention that they stuck their heads in</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.850" end="00:18:05.960" style="s2">the sand and ignore it because it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.789" end="00:18:08.510" style="s2">really fit the way they wanted the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.960" end="00:18:11.029" style="s2">company to grow yep actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.510" end="00:18:12.409" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting and in fact I might</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.029" end="00:18:14.270" style="s2">even go a step further and say they</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.409" end="00:18:16.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t really stick their head in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.270" end="00:18:18.679" style="s2">sand quite the opposite because they</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.220" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">were so metrics driven and the key</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.679" end="00:18:22.760" style="s2">metric for a long time was engagement</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:25.279" style="s2">they actually had a positive incentive</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.760" end="00:18:27.950" style="s2">not just head-in-the-sand to tweak their</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.279" end="00:18:29.210" style="s2">algorithms yeah they had to ignore the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.950" end="00:18:30.950" style="s2">idea that you know you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.210" end="00:18:33.080" style="s2">right that they thought that was the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.950" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">pursue their going they had to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.080" end="00:18:40.789" style="s2">the fact that it they were encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:44.029" style="s2">the engine that wound up becoming a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.789" end="00:18:46.490" style="s2">efficient engine of destructive content</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.029" end="00:18:49.370" style="s2">which could erode democracy for instance</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.490" end="00:18:52.220" style="s2">and it could lead people to rot and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.370" end="00:18:54.679" style="s2">caused fatal riots in countries where</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.220" end="00:18:56.659" style="s2">Facebook didn&#39;t have anyone who spoke in</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.679" end="00:18:58.909" style="s2">the native language yeah I wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.659" end="00:19:01.460" style="s2">necessarily clearly their algorithm was</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.909" end="00:19:03.169" style="s2">not optimised for badness but what it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.460" end="00:19:05.659" style="s2">was optimized for was high cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.169" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">impact all right you know the</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.580" end="00:26:25.100" style="s2">clear by the end of that election cycle</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.529" end="00:26:27.529" style="s2">then it was causing damage there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.529" end="00:26:31.759" style="s2">advertising which makes all online</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.019" end="00:26:34.779" style="s2">advertising different but particularly</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.759" end="00:26:37.429" style="s2">Facebook which is micro targeting right</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.779" end="00:26:39.860" style="s2">historically if I ran an ad and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.429" end="00:26:41.779" style="s2">say I made a grossly racist appeal I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.860" end="00:26:42.740" style="s2">would get a lot of comeback as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.779" end="00:26:45.650" style="s2">candidate for</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.740" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">grossly racist ad right I remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.650" end="00:26:50.570" style="s2">George HW Bush got a lot of swing back</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.220" style="s2">for his Willie Horton ads right he</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.570" end="00:26:52.580" style="s2">eventually won but he took a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.220" end="00:26:54.800" style="s2">grief</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.580" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">the problem with micro-targeting is I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.800" end="00:26:58.910" style="s2">can send those racist ads just to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:01.610" style="s2">racists who aren&#39;t likely to complain</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.910" end="00:27:04.670" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s something that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.610" end="00:27:06.590" style="s2">affordances that Facebook provides to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.670" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">all marketers but particularly political</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.590" end="00:27:11.030" style="s2">marketers fundamentally changes the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:12.170" style="s2">well it doesn&#39;t fundamentally change the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.030" end="00:27:13.910" style="s2">game you combine it with the cost</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.170" end="00:27:15.980" style="s2">advantage because you could do micro</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.910" end="00:27:17.570" style="s2">targeting with direct mail but it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.980" end="00:27:19.910" style="s2">very expensive you can do micro</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.570" end="00:27:22.490" style="s2">targeting on Facebook and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.910" end="00:27:24.200" style="s2">cheap and allows you to you know send</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.490" end="00:27:26.540" style="s2">different messages to different people</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.200" end="00:27:30.980" style="s2">and not be held publicly accountable for</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.540" end="00:27:33.380" style="s2">your advertising yeah yeah as you say it</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.980" end="00:27:35.929" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change the game it advances it</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.380" end="00:27:38.570" style="s2">and then it advances it so far that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.929" end="00:27:41.990" style="s2">does change the game I was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.570" end="00:27:43.940" style="s2">if you do the same thing at a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.990" end="00:27:46.309" style="s2">speed and a lower cost it actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.940" end="00:27:49.220" style="s2">becomes a different thing because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.309" end="00:27:52.010" style="s2">able to use it in a sentence where it</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.220" end="00:27:53.390" style="s2">affects the situation much more than if</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.010" end="00:27:55.730" style="s2">you did it at a lower level</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.390" end="00:27:57.830" style="s2">that&#39;s like saying computers we use now</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.730" end="00:28:00.530" style="s2">and our hands or different devices than</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.830" end="00:28:04.250" style="s2">those things that we used in the early</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.530" end="00:28:07.040" style="s2">1980s so I think you know the micro</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.250" end="00:28:09.800" style="s2">targeting becomes a very big issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.040" end="00:28:12.290" style="s2">because Facebook enables not to happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.800" end="00:28:14.420" style="s2">and as you say these political marketers</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.290" end="00:28:18.770" style="s2">can identify people who are susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.420" end="00:28:21.920" style="s2">to messages so Facebook&#39;s model is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.770" end="00:28:24.410" style="s2">deliver advertisements to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.920" end="00:28:28.070" style="s2">likely to respond to it and they argue</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.410" end="00:28:30.410" style="s2">Facebook argues that you should welcome</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.070" end="00:28:33.110" style="s2">these advertisements because they are</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.410" end="00:28:35.630" style="s2">relevant to you they are going to give</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.110" end="00:28:37.130" style="s2">you buying opportunities up to things</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.630" end="00:28:40.940" style="s2">that you actually want to buy if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.130" end="00:28:44.330" style="s2">a fan of an obscure music group and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.940" end="00:28:46.340" style="s2">there&#39;s some t-shirt then you never</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.330" end="00:28:48.770" style="s2">would have known about with this group&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.340" end="00:28:50.150" style="s2">you know the logo on it it&#39;ll find you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.770" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">and say you know hey here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.150" end="00:28:53.120" style="s2">that you will with article clothing you</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:54.860" style="s2">will love to have that you didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.120" end="00:28:56.710" style="s2">existed and I&#39;ve had that happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.860" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">on Facebook and bought the t-shirt</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.710" end="00:29:01.629" style="s2">but where it&#39;s different is when</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:03.970" style="s2">Facebook understands or you know enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.629" end="00:29:08.619" style="s2">about you to know where your weakness is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.970" end="00:29:11.559" style="s2">and then sells your contact the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.619" end="00:29:14.679" style="s2">give allows people to contact you to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.559" end="00:29:15.159" style="s2">exploit your weakness that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.679" end="00:29:17.230" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.159" end="00:29:19.809" style="s2">people aren&#39;t so happy when they hear</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.230" end="00:29:21.909" style="s2">they&#39;re being manipulated by people you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.809" end="00:29:24.580" style="s2">know people are able to know their</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.909" end="00:29:25.749" style="s2">weaknesses and then exploit them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.580" end="00:29:27.639" style="s2">something different if different</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.749" end="00:29:30.340" style="s2">character and we&#39;re having a debate now</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.639" end="00:29:32.440" style="s2">about whether that&#39;s kosher to do in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.340" end="00:29:34.419" style="s2">political campaign some people think</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.440" end="00:29:36.730" style="s2">that Facebook or anyone else shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.419" end="00:29:39.580" style="s2">be allowed to do that degree of micro</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.730" end="00:29:41.350" style="s2">targeting in a campaign yeah that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.580" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">interesting question and as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.350" end="00:29:45.159" style="s2">know Facebook is holding the line that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">they&#39;re going to allow it for the coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.159" end="00:29:50.110" style="s2">election and I can tell you from some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:51.700" style="s2">my own sources that the Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.110" end="00:29:55.509" style="s2">particularly the Trump campaign have</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.700" end="00:29:57.820" style="s2">invested vast sums in running the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.509" end="00:30:00.039" style="s2">sophisticated ever social media based</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.820" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">election campaign and have raised a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.039" end="00:30:04.570" style="s2">gigantic war chest and in fact part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:06.279" style="s2">their pitch to donors is specifically</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.570" end="00:30:09.999" style="s2">this so it&#39;s going to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.279" end="00:30:12.970" style="s2">20/20 experience you know in 2016 they</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.999" end="00:30:15.789" style="s2">actually did run the best campaign and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.970" end="00:30:18.850" style="s2">by far and the people of Facebook we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.789" end="00:30:21.340" style="s2">looked on in awe at how well the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.850" end="00:30:23.049" style="s2">campaign used Facebook and I you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.340" end="00:30:26.019" style="s2">come face book also lent them help they</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.049" end="00:30:27.879" style="s2">embedded some of their employees in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.019" end="00:30:29.740" style="s2">campaign just like they do for any big</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.879" end="00:30:31.450" style="s2">advertiser to help them use the platform</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.740" end="00:30:33.190" style="s2">better they offered the same to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.450" end="00:30:34.899" style="s2">Clinton campaign the Clinton campaign</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.190" end="00:30:36.759" style="s2">said not don&#39;t don&#39;t need it go away</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.899" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">you&#39;re not important you know we want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.759" end="00:30:42.009" style="s2">do that but the Trump campaign took the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:43.539" style="s2">help and and in a way that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.009" end="00:30:45.940" style="s2">need it quite as much because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.539" end="00:30:48.309" style="s2">really understood Facebook and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.940" end="00:30:49.539" style="s2">able to do things like do though some</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.309" end="00:30:51.610" style="s2">days they ran a hundred seventy five</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.539" end="00:30:54.309" style="s2">thousand different ads to different</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.610" end="00:30:57.100" style="s2">people because they were able to tailor</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.309" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">them to exactly what they thought those</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.100" end="00:31:01.090" style="s2">targets wanted right here&#39;s the person</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.769" style="s2">who&#39;s interested in gun rights let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.090" end="00:31:04.869" style="s2">a gun ad to them here&#39;s a person who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.519" end="00:31:09.770" style="s2">probably going to vote for Trump let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.259" end="00:31:11.150" style="s2">send them something they get them</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.770" end="00:31:13.520" style="s2">sick of the whole system so maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.150" end="00:31:15.920" style="s2">won&#39;t vote so they were able to do all</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.520" end="00:31:19.700" style="s2">these different ads the people did you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.920" end="00:31:22.190" style="s2">know to be very effective in helping one</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.700" end="00:31:23.750" style="s2">Election Day yep and they&#39;re gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.190" end="00:31:25.340" style="s2">even more this time I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.750" end="00:31:28.070" style="s2">though I will say one thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.340" end="00:31:30.470" style="s2">changed I do a little bit of promoting</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.070" end="00:31:32.950" style="s2">of my podcast on Facebook and I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.470" end="00:31:36.590" style="s2">getting a fair number of my episodes</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.950" end="00:31:39.560" style="s2">censured by the advertising clearance</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.590" end="00:31:42.590" style="s2">engine at Facebook because some of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.560" end="00:31:45.710" style="s2">episodes maybe 15% of them are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.590" end="00:31:48.950" style="s2">political right and they now require you</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.710" end="00:31:52.070" style="s2">to register as a political advertiser if</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.950" end="00:31:54.560" style="s2">you&#39;re going to run political ads and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.070" end="00:31:56.390" style="s2">you have to put a check on the ad if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.560" end="00:31:58.820" style="s2">believe that it infringes in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.390" end="00:32:00.740" style="s2">political space and so I actually went</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.820" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">through the process of registering as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.740" end="00:32:05.510" style="s2">political advertiser on Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:08.030" style="s2">when I have an episode that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.510" end="00:32:11.690" style="s2">explicitly political I&#39;ll check the box</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.030" end="00:32:13.520" style="s2">so unlike in 2016 Facebook knows what is</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.520" end="00:32:18.230" style="s2">2016 they didn&#39;t know or care so at</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.460" end="00:32:19.820" style="s2">least in theory and frankly I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.230" end="00:32:22.100" style="s2">whether they&#39;re doing this or not but</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.820" end="00:32:25.880" style="s2">they should it would be really helpful</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.880" end="00:32:32.330" style="s2">discourse if facebook published every ad</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">that was run with the political checkbox</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.330" end="00:32:37.010" style="s2">next to it and the micro-targeting</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:39.230" style="s2">filter that was applied to it so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.010" end="00:32:41.330" style="s2">public interests people obviously</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.230" end="00:32:42.950" style="s2">citizens aren&#39;t gonna do it&#39;d be too</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.330" end="00:32:43.400" style="s2">much data but you know public interest</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.400" end="00:32:48.110" style="s2">if only the opponent could go through</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.170" end="00:32:49.730" style="s2">this and say huh you know Biden is you</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.110" end="00:32:52.400" style="s2">know appealing to black nationalists</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.730" end="00:32:54.410" style="s2">with an obviously racist meme or Trump</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.400" end="00:32:56.060" style="s2">is you know appealing to neo-nazis but</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.410" end="00:32:58.940" style="s2">doing it in a surreptitious way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.060" end="00:33:01.460" style="s2">only neo-nazis see so that one reform</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.940" end="00:33:04.220" style="s2">alone could be quite helpful in letting</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.460" end="00:33:05.960" style="s2">you know the immune system of discourse</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.220" end="00:33:09.050" style="s2">in journalism and frankly even</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.050" end="00:33:13.310" style="s2">targeting well actually they do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.750" end="00:33:15.890" style="s2">they do and when you could check that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.310" end="00:33:18.620" style="s2">box and you know you that the hot stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.890" end="00:33:20.660" style="s2">goes into an archive that in theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.620" end="00:33:23.570" style="s2">could be searched um you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.660" end="00:33:25.430" style="s2">question about how you know great</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.570" end="00:33:27.770" style="s2">or to search it and you know can help</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.430" end="00:33:30.890" style="s2">what kind of access research groups have</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.770" end="00:33:32.780" style="s2">to that archive but you know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.890" end="00:33:34.940" style="s2">the fury that you know that anything a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.780" end="00:33:37.400" style="s2">protocol being able to archive and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.940" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">when they first did that media outlets</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.400" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">were outraged when they would do</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:42.590" style="s2">articles about political things and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">Facebook would say well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.590" end="00:33:47.090" style="s2">political and said wait a minute we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:48.860" style="s2">not playing we&#39;re we&#39;re news and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.090" end="00:33:51.050" style="s2">know I think Jim you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.860" end="00:33:53.000" style="s2">interesting I did see what you would</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.050" end="00:33:54.680" style="s2">have happened if you push back and said</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.000" end="00:33:57.230" style="s2">I&#39;m a news source I&#39;m not a political</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.680" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">source because there was a big fight</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.230" end="00:34:01.610" style="s2">within Facebook the people who work with</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:03.290" style="s2">journalists and Facebook in the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.610" end="00:34:05.240" style="s2">journalism project we&#39;re saying hey we</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.290" end="00:34:06.620" style="s2">really can&#39;t do that and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.240" end="00:34:08.570" style="s2">gonna get a lot of crap from journalists</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.620" end="00:34:10.640" style="s2">and journalists and publishers and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.570" end="00:34:12.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what they did and Facebook did</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.640" end="00:34:15.920" style="s2">pull back a little from that but it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.950" end="00:34:17.720" style="s2">difficult to determine what&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.920" end="00:34:20.360" style="s2">and what&#39;s not political when it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.720" end="00:34:23.570" style="s2">campaign actually taking out the ad but</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.360" end="00:34:25.820" style="s2">you know it could be like a podcast of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.570" end="00:34:28.430" style="s2">someone who may lean left to right but</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.820" end="00:34:31.070" style="s2">that&#39;s okay yeah there&#39;s publications</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.430" end="00:34:33.170" style="s2">like that or it could be a publication</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.070" end="00:34:35.600" style="s2">like the New York Times or Wall Street</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.170" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">Journal or beat&#39;em right Bart that says</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.600" end="00:34:40.880" style="s2">you know well this is you know an</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:43.490" style="s2">editorial we&#39;re running so it gets into</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.880" end="00:34:46.370" style="s2">murky grounds yeah it does and frankly I</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.490" end="00:34:48.200" style="s2">had that thought but at the tiny level I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.370" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">advertised clearly I&#39;m just being</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.200" end="00:34:52.820" style="s2">filtered by machine and it wasn&#39;t worth</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:54.530" style="s2">my time to go argue with the goddamn</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.820" end="00:34:56.510" style="s2">Borg right and trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.530" end="00:34:58.460" style="s2">Facebook it&#39;s impossible there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.510" end="00:34:59.870" style="s2">to get ahold anybody it&#39;s just a fucking</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.460" end="00:35:01.430" style="s2">nightmare so I said all right I&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.870" end="00:35:03.770" style="s2">the process and get registered as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.430" end="00:35:05.420" style="s2">advertiser but you were right probably I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.770" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">could have fought the fight but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.420" end="00:35:08.390" style="s2">wasn&#39;t worth the time</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:09.380" style="s2">let&#39;s change directions here a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:11.420" style="s2">bit this has been extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.380" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">interesting but I&#39;d like to you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.420" end="00:35:17.120" style="s2">sort of focus back a little bit on</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:20.740" style="s2">Zuckerberg the person and how he evolved</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.120" end="00:35:24.260" style="s2">both as a person and his character and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.740" end="00:35:26.300" style="s2">how Facebook evolved from earlier things</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.260" end="00:35:27.560" style="s2">that he did and and kind of came up a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.300" end="00:35:29.630" style="s2">slope a little bit at a time</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.560" end="00:35:32.330" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s you know struck</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.630" end="00:35:34.970" style="s2">me when I read the book and then went</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.330" end="00:35:36.950" style="s2">researched it again to create my topics</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.970" end="00:35:40.190" style="s2">for the show was</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.950" end="00:35:43.220" style="s2">Zuckerberg was born in 1984 he&#39;s a baby</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.190" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">right I&#39;d already left the source and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.220" end="00:35:48.530" style="s2">started my first two companies by 1984</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:50.360" style="s2">I guess he&#39;s the king of the Millennials</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.530" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">which I think in itself is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.360" end="00:35:54.830" style="s2">and something us geezers need to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:58.070" style="s2">mind when we think about Zuckerberg that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.830" end="00:36:00.530" style="s2">he is if not quite an internet native</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.070" end="00:36:01.670" style="s2">he&#39;s certainly an online native and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.530" end="00:36:03.050" style="s2">think that&#39;s something well worth</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.670" end="00:36:05.330" style="s2">keeping in mind when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.050" end="00:36:07.610" style="s2">Zuckerberg how much did that came</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.330" end="00:36:11.480" style="s2">through in his personality that he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.610" end="00:36:14.180" style="s2">an online native quite quite a lot right</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.480" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">in 1984 you mentioned Huelva that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.180" end="00:36:17.300" style="s2">my first book came out and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:19.220" style="s2">that hackers conference which was indeed</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.300" end="00:36:19.580" style="s2">generated by my book that was my book</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.220" end="00:36:22.790" style="s2">party</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.580" end="00:36:24.590" style="s2">the Kevin Kelly in Stuart brand the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.790" end="00:36:28.550" style="s2">people whole earth through after they</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.590" end="00:36:31.190" style="s2">did that book so he grew up as an AOL</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.550" end="00:36:33.140" style="s2">Instant Messenger kid and he was always</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.190" end="00:36:35.240" style="s2">building projects and thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.140" end="00:36:38.330" style="s2">what to do he built some projects on top</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.240" end="00:36:41.050" style="s2">of that he built a product that was very</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.330" end="00:36:44.410" style="s2">much like based on synapse which was</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.050" end="00:36:47.750" style="s2">it&#39;s called synapse a I it was based on</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.410" end="00:36:50.840" style="s2">Wynn app which was the music player</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.750" end="00:36:52.970" style="s2">which AOL bought and that was very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.840" end="00:36:54.740" style="s2">his frame of mind and then and all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.970" end="00:36:57.230" style="s2">stuff woman on the internet in the web</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.740" end="00:36:58.790" style="s2">very he grew up using web-based tools</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.230" end="00:37:00.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s why he was able to build</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.790" end="00:37:03.170" style="s2">Facebook so quickly is because he</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.920" end="00:37:05.810" style="s2">understood in a way that maybe an older</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.170" end="00:37:08.360" style="s2">person wouldn&#39;t have understood then you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.810" end="00:37:09.620" style="s2">could build an application really</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.360" end="00:37:12.500" style="s2">quickly and it could be really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.620" end="00:37:14.300" style="s2">it can be updated really quickly using</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.500" end="00:37:16.730" style="s2">some of the brand new tools of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.300" end="00:37:20.810" style="s2">development which had come out along</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.730" end="00:37:23.780" style="s2">with the popularization of the web in</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.810" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">the late 90s and early 2000s and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.780" end="00:37:28.430" style="s2">really framed the way he thought about</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.770" style="s2">things to the degree that when the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.430" end="00:37:34.370" style="s2">mobile revolution came six seven years</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.770" end="00:37:36.710" style="s2">later in around 2010 2011 Zuckerberg was</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.370" end="00:37:40.790" style="s2">quite short he was like more of a web</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.710" end="00:37:43.010" style="s2">person and his generation was a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.790" end="00:37:46.280" style="s2">behind in mobile and Facebook got cut</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.010" end="00:37:48.050" style="s2">short and had to really regain itself in</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.280" end="00:37:50.420" style="s2">order to build itself into a mobile</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.050" end="00:37:52.849" style="s2">company and that was in part because</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.420" end="00:37:54.200" style="s2">Burg&#39;s mentality was the web interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.849" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">and that reminds me a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.200" end="00:37:57.650" style="s2">as I read that in your book and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.900" style="s2">remember the history of it and part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.650" end="00:38:01.730" style="s2">the expenditure of a ridiculously large</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.900" end="00:38:03.859" style="s2">sum of money for whatsapp was about</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.730" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">closing that gap it reminded me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.859" end="00:38:10.040" style="s2">gates Bill Gates right mr. PC he was</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:13.339" style="s2">amazingly blind to the Internet right</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.040" end="00:38:16.280" style="s2">right and they famously famously had to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.339" end="00:38:17.930" style="s2">call an all-hands meeting and refocused</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.280" end="00:38:19.970" style="s2">the company on the internet but they did</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.970" end="00:38:24.500" style="s2">similar though unlike Microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:26.660" style="s2">Zuckerberg did make the change in time I</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.500" end="00:38:29.089" style="s2">was amazed watching their percentage go</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.660" end="00:38:31.339" style="s2">from web-based app based just was like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.089" end="00:38:32.690" style="s2">rocket ship very very rapidly now</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.339" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">another thing that you mentioned I</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.690" end="00:38:39.470" style="s2">believe about a dozen times in the book</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:42.260" style="s2">is that Jacques was a great gamer PC</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.470" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">based games in particular civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.260" end="00:38:46.099" style="s2">being one of his favorite games but also</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.329" style="s2">risk and a bunch of others and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.099" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">resonated with me because I&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.329" end="00:38:52.609" style="s2">gamer since I was 10 years old back when</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">we played Avalon Hill wargames on</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.609" end="00:38:57.319" style="s2">tabletops and have gone through all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:59.299" style="s2">evolutions in fact I recently had</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.319" end="00:39:02.030" style="s2">created a phone based game which is out</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.299" end="00:39:04.280" style="s2">for beta test right now so you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.030" end="00:39:07.970" style="s2">a dozen times so you must think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.280" end="00:39:10.040" style="s2">sucks interest and saturation and games</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.970" end="00:39:12.609" style="s2">particularly civilization is an</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.040" end="00:39:15.530" style="s2">important insight into his personality</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.609" end="00:39:18.500" style="s2">right I think it&#39;s telling the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.530" end="00:39:21.230" style="s2">games he gravitated to though I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.500" end="00:39:23.809" style="s2">he&#39;s not a stranger to shoot him ups he</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.230" end="00:39:28.040" style="s2">really loved the game is where you built</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.809" end="00:39:30.020" style="s2">a society and ran a society and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.040" end="00:39:32.170" style="s2">he plays board games - and risk was one</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:35.930" style="s2">of his favorites he well into adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.170" end="00:39:38.660" style="s2">and as you know the point of that games</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.930" end="00:39:40.190" style="s2">to take over the world and when he first</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.660" end="00:39:42.440" style="s2">started the Facebook which was what</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.190" end="00:39:44.540" style="s2">Facebook was called when he launched it</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.440" end="00:39:46.670" style="s2">at Harvard within a couple weeks</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.540" end="00:39:48.650" style="s2">he was already gearing up to move it to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.670" end="00:39:51.230" style="s2">other campuses after he released it at</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.650" end="00:39:53.240" style="s2">Harvard so the whole world of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.230" end="00:39:55.160" style="s2">universities became his risk board and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.240" end="00:39:58.250" style="s2">he went from one to another some of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.160" end="00:39:59.750" style="s2">already had similar systems working but</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.250" end="00:40:02.690" style="s2">he would take them over just like you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.750" end="00:40:03.900" style="s2">take over a country and risk where maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.690" end="00:40:05.160" style="s2">some pieces are already</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.900" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">they&#39;re from one of the opposing players</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.160" end="00:40:10.799" style="s2">it was a good window into his mind yet I</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:13.319" style="s2">actually noticed that when I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.799" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">my content prep for this call you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.319" end="00:40:17.579" style="s2">pointed out that the first college that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:19.740" style="s2">he went after after Harbor was Columbia</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.579" end="00:40:22.829" style="s2">which seemed counterintuitive because it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.740" end="00:40:25.829" style="s2">had already had a similar service but a</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.829" end="00:40:27.869" style="s2">game player might well say you know hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.829" end="00:40:31.140" style="s2">guy want to attack that entranceway into</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.869" end="00:40:33.240" style="s2">Australia in risk right rather than go</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.140" end="00:40:35.819" style="s2">grab some cheap territory in Mongolia</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.240" end="00:40:37.950" style="s2">because you know two things one I want</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.819" end="00:40:40.289" style="s2">to crush an early opponent before they</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.950" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">can get bigger that&#39;s game thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.289" end="00:40:45.630" style="s2">second in the meta game of business you</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:47.099" style="s2">strengthen yourself by competition and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.630" end="00:40:49.770" style="s2">testing yourself against others and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.099" end="00:40:52.500" style="s2">learning faster than the other guy so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.770" end="00:40:54.930" style="s2">would say you know suck probably did</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.500" end="00:40:56.970" style="s2">internalize a lot of very useful lessons</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:40:58.920" style="s2">from gaming I know I bet I mean I had</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.970" end="00:41:00.930" style="s2">people ask me what are my influences in</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.920" end="00:41:03.089" style="s2">my business career and I said war gaming</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.930" end="00:41:05.670" style="s2">was certainly one of the top three or</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.089" end="00:41:07.799" style="s2">four I was impressed by the fact you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.670" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">know how often you you brought that back</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.799" end="00:41:12.150" style="s2">and wove it into the storyline now</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:13.500" style="s2">another question that really jumped out</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.150" end="00:41:16.710" style="s2">at me again particularly as I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.500" end="00:41:20.099" style="s2">reviewing my notes that Zuckerberg took</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.710" end="00:41:22.289" style="s2">a consciously elitist educational</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.099" end="00:41:24.329" style="s2">approach that seemed kind of contrary to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.289" end="00:41:26.940" style="s2">his own interests kind of demanded that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.329" end="00:41:28.980" style="s2">he go to Exeter and then Harvard he</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.940" end="00:41:31.049" style="s2">always wanted to go to Harvard rather</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.980" end="00:41:33.420" style="s2">than what we&#39;re seeing more natural</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.049" end="00:41:36.150" style="s2">Stanford MIT Carnegie Mellon University</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.420" end="00:41:38.700" style="s2">of Michigan University of Texas one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.150" end="00:41:41.099" style="s2">the universities more well known for its</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.700" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">computer science department she did an</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.099" end="00:41:48.930" style="s2">insights or you know motivational sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:51.990" style="s2">of you know why this kid who clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.930" end="00:41:55.140" style="s2">nerd and a geek would serve forcefully</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.990" end="00:41:57.240" style="s2">pound the table for the extra hard route</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.140" end="00:42:00.730" style="s2">rather than the you know public high</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.240" end="00:42:03.190" style="s2">school MIT route for instance</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.730" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">right well the Exeter you know he had</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.190" end="00:42:08.109" style="s2">heard about the they they have a great</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:10.300" style="s2">computer program there and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.109" end="00:42:12.310" style="s2">he he went as freshman sophomore years</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.300" end="00:42:14.290" style="s2">of high school to the public high school</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.310" end="00:42:17.320" style="s2">in Westchester County which wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.290" end="00:42:19.000" style="s2">terrible high school but he exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.320" end="00:42:21.400" style="s2">all the opportunities he had for</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.000" end="00:42:23.410" style="s2">learning about computers there his</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.400" end="00:42:25.690" style="s2">mother wanted him to go to a closer</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.410" end="00:42:27.910" style="s2">private school Horace Mann where he can</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.690" end="00:42:30.310" style="s2">commute and she didn&#39;t want him to leave</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.910" end="00:42:32.260" style="s2">the house his older sister was going off</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.310" end="00:42:33.190" style="s2">actually to Harvard and she didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.260" end="00:42:35.260" style="s2">to lose two kids</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.190" end="00:42:37.089" style="s2">on the same year she wanted to have him</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.260" end="00:42:39.070" style="s2">around for his high school years and he</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.089" end="00:42:40.599" style="s2">said there I&#39;m going to Exeter and he</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.070" end="00:42:43.300" style="s2">said she said why don&#39;t I just at least</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.599" end="00:42:43.930" style="s2">interview with Horace Mann and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.300" end="00:42:45.460" style="s2">you&#39;ll like it</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.930" end="00:42:47.109" style="s2">and he said all interview with him but</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.460" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">I&#39;m going to Exeter I mean with Exeter</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.109" end="00:42:51.940" style="s2">now the Harvard thing I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:54.910" style="s2">because his sister went there he knew</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.940" end="00:42:57.640" style="s2">people he also was interested in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.910" end="00:42:59.589" style="s2">non computer things he took a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.640" end="00:43:03.339" style="s2">psychology courses and he was interested</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.589" end="00:43:05.710" style="s2">in the classics and Latin heroes old</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.339" end="00:43:08.650" style="s2">Gustus Caesar not Conqueror so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.710" end="00:43:11.740" style="s2">said the best I can get to why he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.650" end="00:43:14.619" style="s2">to go to Harvard he had a Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.740" end="00:43:16.300" style="s2">pennant in his room and Exeter someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.619" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">called me which was interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.300" end="00:43:20.740" style="s2">you&#39;re right it turns out that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:24.460" style="s2">make an argument that he might have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.740" end="00:43:26.310" style="s2">happier MIT or Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.460" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">he was always building things and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.310" end="00:43:34.450" style="s2">Harvard wasn&#39;t really friendly to people</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:38.020" style="s2">who were entrepreneurial then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.450" end="00:43:40.329" style="s2">close to Stanford or MIT and you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.020" end="00:43:41.770" style="s2">other people there who you know had an</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.329" end="00:43:44.589" style="s2">entrepreneurial bent and they felt big</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.770" end="00:43:46.660" style="s2">the school didn&#39;t encourage them and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.589" end="00:43:49.510" style="s2">know going you know Zuckerberg gone to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.660" end="00:43:52.300" style="s2">spat with some other people you know in</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.510" end="00:43:54.730" style="s2">terms of their companies and this has</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.300" end="00:43:57.250" style="s2">sort of been documented not a hard</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.730" end="00:43:59.380" style="s2">person accurately in this movie the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.250" end="00:44:01.300" style="s2">Harvard really didn&#39;t want to ending a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.380" end="00:44:05.349" style="s2">deal with that you know that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.300" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">their DNA yeah that came up again and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.349" end="00:44:07.960" style="s2">again we&#39;ll get to that a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">I&#39;m I take a little sidebar here because</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.960" end="00:44:11.740" style="s2">you mentioned it you know I did not have</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:14.589" style="s2">any idea till I read your book that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.740" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">Zuckerberg hero was Caesar Augustus</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.589" end="00:44:19.210" style="s2">sir Octavian as he was known prior to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:20.259" style="s2">his ascent and that really struck me I</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.210" end="00:44:22.930" style="s2">said you know there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.259" end="00:44:25.569" style="s2">the Zuckerberg that reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.930" end="00:44:27.940" style="s2">Octavian right even looks sorta like</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.569" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">some of the younger statues of him I</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.940" end="00:44:32.410" style="s2">wonder if he is consciously grooming</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:33.849" style="s2">himself to be the Octavian or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.410" end="00:44:36.130" style="s2">Augustus Caesar and people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.849" end="00:44:39.059" style="s2">know the transition between the Republic</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.130" end="00:44:42.700" style="s2">and the Empire Octavian was this very</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.059" end="00:44:44.829" style="s2">unlikely character when Caesar Julius</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.700" end="00:44:47.380" style="s2">Caesar was assassinated at the Senate by</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.829" end="00:44:49.739" style="s2">Brutus and his friends as laid out</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.380" end="00:44:52.869" style="s2">somewhat accurately I suppose in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.739" end="00:44:55.029" style="s2">Shakespeare play Julius Caesar had been</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.869" end="00:44:57.460" style="s2">publicized but not well known that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.029" end="00:45:01.319" style="s2">Caesar had recently made Octavian this</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.460" end="00:45:03.849" style="s2">19 year old distant cousin his heir and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.319" end="00:45:05.739" style="s2">all the power brokers of the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.849" end="00:45:08.710" style="s2">thought this little punk could be pushed</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.739" end="00:45:12.579" style="s2">aside but guess what this little punk</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.710" end="00:45:14.890" style="s2">was smarter more ruthless but quiet and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.579" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">low-key than the rest of them and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.890" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">ended up killing them all off over time</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">and becoming the first emperor of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:26.109" style="s2">Roman world for someone to choose</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:28.410" style="s2">Octavian Augustus Caesar as their hero</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.109" end="00:45:31.569" style="s2">is kind of a very interesting choice</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.410" end="00:45:34.809" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s a point where you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.569" end="00:45:38.019" style="s2">he went I think was his honeymoon to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.809" end="00:45:40.890" style="s2">Rome and he dragged his wife</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.019" end="00:45:44.170" style="s2">so all these sites that you know where</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.890" end="00:45:46.989" style="s2">Divya went and you know the museum&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.170" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">exhibits about this and she complained</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.989" end="00:45:50.680" style="s2">that there were three people or any</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:53.499" style="s2">movie you know G and Zuckerberg and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.680" end="00:45:54.940" style="s2">Octavius Caesar Augustus Caesar that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.499" end="00:45:57.069" style="s2">amazing and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.940" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">something worth considering comes you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.069" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">know again in a historical context you</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:04.089" style="s2">know Octavian or you know Gus the Caesar</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:06.670" style="s2">could be thought as comparable to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.089" end="00:46:09.069" style="s2">know a Napoleon or a Hitler or a Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.670" end="00:46:11.319" style="s2">right only more successful than any of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.069" end="00:46:13.630" style="s2">them so I mean it&#39;s a very odd choice to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.319" end="00:46:16.809" style="s2">be you&#39;re here exactly he wasn&#39;t a warm</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.630" end="00:46:19.210" style="s2">fuzzy guy yeah not at all I mean he was</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.809" end="00:46:21.910" style="s2">a cold stone killer including you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.210" end="00:46:23.499" style="s2">his own children his wife well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.910" end="00:46:25.660" style="s2">think he killed him you know he exiled</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.499" end="00:46:28.180" style="s2">them till they died basically today a</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.660" end="00:46:30.010" style="s2">real real cold and tough guy</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.180" end="00:46:31.869" style="s2">and conquered the world basically took</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.010" end="00:46:34.329" style="s2">over the biggest Empire in world history</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.869" end="00:46:37.030" style="s2">at that point it&#39;s the next point and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.329" end="00:46:39.550" style="s2">you alluded to it which was from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.030" end="00:46:40.510" style="s2">very time he got to even in late high</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.550" end="00:46:42.010" style="s2">school but in particular have time he</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.510" end="00:46:44.920" style="s2">got to Harvard Zuckerberg was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.010" end="00:46:47.130" style="s2">relentless small-scale web developer</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.920" end="00:46:49.480" style="s2">being paid by other people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.130" end="00:46:52.180" style="s2">entrepreneur trying all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.480" end="00:46:54.040" style="s2">in a rather non Harvard ish kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.180" end="00:46:56.170" style="s2">fashion and that did put him a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.040" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">bit sideways with Harvard and as you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.170" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">point out MIT or Stanford wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.750" style="s2">cared you know I was I went to MIT in</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:05.950" style="s2">the early 70s and the culture there was</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.750" end="00:47:07.690" style="s2">man you had to do something pretty bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.950" end="00:47:10.329" style="s2">on a computer to get into trouble and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:12.550" style="s2">you know the first time he came to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.329" end="00:47:14.849" style="s2">attention I think of the authorities was</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.550" end="00:47:17.770" style="s2">he creates something called face mash</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.849" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">essentially a juvenile take off on</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.770" end="00:47:20.650" style="s2">hot-or-not</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:23.609" style="s2">and it had a lot of the hacker ish</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.650" end="00:47:26.440" style="s2">aspects you know scraping photos off the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.609" end="00:47:29.530" style="s2">official face site not concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.440" end="00:47:31.420" style="s2">privacy or permissions etc but it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.530" end="00:47:34.260" style="s2">within the spirit of the hacker ethos of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.420" end="00:47:36.250" style="s2">that time I&#39;d say yeah it was but</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.260" end="00:47:40.329" style="s2">Harvard didn&#39;t have much of a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.250" end="00:47:42.339" style="s2">humor about it and I think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.329" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">combination of that he violated their</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.339" end="00:47:48.250" style="s2">security rules you know by working his</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:51.579" style="s2">way into the computers with the other</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.250" end="00:47:55.780" style="s2">houses these residential houses that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.579" end="00:47:57.579" style="s2">organized in in order to scrape the you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.780" end="00:48:00.040" style="s2">know the the databases get the pictures</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.579" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">but also it was a very politically</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.040" end="00:48:05.140" style="s2">incorrect thing to do the the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:06.940" style="s2">groups at Harvard complained that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.140" end="00:48:10.089" style="s2">were being objectified you know which</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.940" end="00:48:13.510" style="s2">they were and so there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.089" end="00:48:16.630" style="s2">pressure of Harvard not to ignore it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.510" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">of course the the the rules he violated</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.630" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">were free speech rules but were rules</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:24.520" style="s2">about not breaking into computers and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:26.680" style="s2">and getting the information and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.520" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">lesson he learned from that was hey</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.680" end="00:48:32.950" style="s2">don&#39;t do it again if I&#39;m going to build</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:34.420" style="s2">my site the is a community site and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.950" end="00:48:37.180" style="s2">not going to steal the information from</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.420" end="00:48:39.069" style="s2">Harvard I&#39;m going to make people bring</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.180" end="00:48:41.380" style="s2">their own that way there&#39;s no privacy</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.069" end="00:48:41.960" style="s2">issue in terms of that because the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.380" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.960" end="00:48:46.220" style="s2">have provided it themselves about</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:48.740" style="s2">themselves I got Ben to do it for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.220" end="00:48:50.329" style="s2">in fact you mentioned the earliest days</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.740" end="00:48:52.730" style="s2">of the Facebook there&#39;s a direct quote</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.329" end="00:48:54.740" style="s2">from your book that the Facebook the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.730" end="00:48:56.690" style="s2">precursor to Facebook offered more</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.740" end="00:48:59.180" style="s2">privacy protection than any other social</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.690" end="00:49:00.530" style="s2">networks of its time so he did learn the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.180" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">lesson even if it might have been</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.530" end="00:49:04.339" style="s2">cynically the other thing I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:06.920" style="s2">was interesting was you talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.339" end="00:49:09.349" style="s2">hearing that he had before the deans etc</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.920" end="00:49:12.050" style="s2">and he was given a slap on the wrist and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.349" end="00:49:15.859" style="s2">the actual charge was something like</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.050" end="00:49:19.309" style="s2">improper social behavior I didn&#39;t harbor</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.859" end="00:49:21.829" style="s2">desk kind of charge zuckerberg and has</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.309" end="00:49:24.380" style="s2">social skills right then you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.829" end="00:49:27.530" style="s2">mentioned again half a dozen times at</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.380" end="00:49:29.329" style="s2">least the Zuckerberg trance really</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.530" end="00:49:32.210" style="s2">apparently quite off-putting go on for</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.329" end="00:49:34.520" style="s2">minutes and you quote one of people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.210" end="00:49:37.160" style="s2">knew him really well as he falls into</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.520" end="00:49:40.040" style="s2">and becomes the Eye of Sauron from Lord</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.160" end="00:49:43.609" style="s2">of the Rings what are you willing to say</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.040" end="00:49:48.109" style="s2">about Zuckerberg social skills and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.609" end="00:49:51.230" style="s2">social aspect right well obviously he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.109" end="00:49:54.049" style="s2">evolved quite a lot from you know a 19</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.230" end="00:49:56.089" style="s2">year old you know who was socially</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.049" end="00:49:59.299" style="s2">challenged in her in the early years of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.089" end="00:50:01.460" style="s2">Facebook as a leader he would get very</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.299" end="00:50:05.349" style="s2">nervous me addressing even his</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.460" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">relatively small team and in all hands</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.349" end="00:50:12.170" style="s2">he has the have this habit of sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:13.579" style="s2">you&#39;d answer my question and he would</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.170" end="00:50:16.220" style="s2">just stare here what happened the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.579" end="00:50:19.369" style="s2">time I met him in 2006 and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.220" end="00:50:21.140" style="s2">unnerving let me tell you and you wonder</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.369" end="00:50:22.940" style="s2">whether there&#39;s something cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.140" end="00:50:24.920" style="s2">going on there but it turns out he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.940" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">just processing things and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.920" end="00:50:30.140" style="s2">left now but sometimes you can ask him a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:32.030" style="s2">question that he didn&#39;t expect there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.140" end="00:50:34.520" style="s2">never an answer ready it&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.030" end="00:50:37.010" style="s2">that look for a little while but nothing</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.520" end="00:50:39.109" style="s2">like the like minutes long pause that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.010" end="00:50:41.089" style="s2">makes you go insane that he used to</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.109" end="00:50:42.829" style="s2">happen he was a younger person with it</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.089" end="00:50:44.990" style="s2">really minutes longer to just seem like</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.829" end="00:50:47.480" style="s2">it maybe it seemed like it but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.990" end="00:50:51.319" style="s2">I think you know you would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.480" end="00:50:54.609" style="s2">approaching that I mean oh really</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.319" end="00:50:57.400" style="s2">way beyond what you&#39;re used to in terms</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.609" end="00:50:59.890" style="s2">of one-to-one interaction local people</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.400" end="00:51:02.170" style="s2">this how they went insane when that</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.890" end="00:51:04.210" style="s2">happen people like Don Graham who was</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.170" end="00:51:07.029" style="s2">the CEO of the Washington Post actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.210" end="00:51:09.970" style="s2">was my boss at the time and Roger</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.029" end="00:51:12.339" style="s2">McNamee it happened to a lot of people I</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.970" end="00:51:14.920" style="s2">did I whenever viewed him once at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.339" end="00:51:17.319" style="s2">end of 2006 at a conference and I asked</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.920" end="00:51:18.700" style="s2">them a question and here is on stage and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.319" end="00:51:19.869" style="s2">they didn&#39;t answer the question for</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.700" end="00:51:21.819" style="s2">minutes and people are getting nervous</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.869" end="00:51:23.049" style="s2">in the audience or like nothing so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.819" end="00:51:26.529" style="s2">think what&#39;s going on here what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.049" end="00:51:28.839" style="s2">on so it it really is something you</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.529" end="00:51:30.549" style="s2">don&#39;t forget it&#39;s interesting I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.839" end="00:51:32.049" style="s2">quite sure what to make of it like you I</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.549" end="00:51:33.549" style="s2">have never experienced that with</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.049" end="00:51:36.309" style="s2">somebody if I ask them a question and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.549" end="00:51:37.960" style="s2">they let&#39;s just say 60 seconds just sit</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.309" end="00:51:40.420" style="s2">there and think about it before they</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.960" end="00:51:42.279" style="s2">answer I suppose at one level it could</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.420" end="00:51:44.619" style="s2">be a mark of respect that he takes your</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.279" end="00:51:46.569" style="s2">question serious enough to think about</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.619" end="00:51:48.849" style="s2">it for 60 seconds but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.569" end="00:51:53.349" style="s2">it seems like you know missing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.849" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">normal social dialogue cues I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.349" end="00:51:58.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like he didn&#39;t want to play that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:52:02.529" style="s2">game in a way I mean he was willing you</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.630" end="00:52:04.869" style="s2">know to take whatever he you know that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.529" end="00:52:09.400" style="s2">like that happened you know he because</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.869" end="00:52:13.180" style="s2">it was Madadi hey&#39;ve you know he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.400" end="00:52:16.269" style="s2">going to bow down to the the niceties of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.180" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">social interaction he was he was he was</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.269" end="00:52:21.789" style="s2">okay with himself being that way until</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:24.940" style="s2">really he had the responsibilities of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.789" end="00:52:27.609" style="s2">CEO and he became an adult and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.940" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">see that with him so much you know that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.609" end="00:52:33.009" style="s2">I once had that treatment from Bill</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:34.839" style="s2">Gates so I once in 1996 I believe I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.009" end="00:52:38.009" style="s2">doing a story the first story about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.839" end="00:52:41.079" style="s2">browser wars and I went visited on him</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.009" end="00:52:42.910" style="s2">in his office and you know gave him a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.079" end="00:52:45.029" style="s2">long complicated opening question about</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.910" end="00:52:48.249" style="s2">the browser wars and he gave me that</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.029" end="00:52:50.140" style="s2">silent treatment for a long time and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.249" end="00:52:53.289" style="s2">know there was like this like dead space</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.140" end="00:52:55.509" style="s2">in the room and you know I just finally</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.289" end="00:52:57.789" style="s2">had minora question did he never did</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.509" end="00:52:59.319" style="s2">answer we did he did I think he was more</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.789" end="00:53:02.109" style="s2">conscious about doing it it was a more</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.319" end="00:53:04.269" style="s2">of a tactic of saying you know fuck you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.109" end="00:53:06.630" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna answer this now and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.269" end="00:53:08.490" style="s2">he then he did later he remember</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.630" end="00:53:10.829" style="s2">you know at some level that seems a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.490" end="00:53:12.660" style="s2">little kind of lacking in social skills</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.829" end="00:53:13.670" style="s2">on Zuckerberg at that time when he was</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.660" end="00:53:16.019" style="s2">at Harvard but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.670" end="00:53:18.900" style="s2">something that it struck me as showing</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.019" end="00:53:21.420" style="s2">great social intelligence if Anna</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.900" end="00:53:23.910" style="s2">Machiavellian Way was the way he played</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.420" end="00:53:25.980" style="s2">the Harvard Crimson again and again he</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.910" end="00:53:28.470" style="s2">got the Harvard Crimson to do a fair</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.980" end="00:53:30.539" style="s2">amount of the work for him yeah yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.470" end="00:53:33.269" style="s2">was like covering Zuckerberg for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.539" end="00:53:35.430" style="s2">Crimson was like you know the way you</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.269" end="00:53:36.750" style="s2">know like a publication covers Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.430" end="00:53:39.359" style="s2">Valley he was a Silicon Valley of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.750" end="00:53:40.759" style="s2">Harvard single-handedly you know you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.359" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">know can they would you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.759" end="00:53:45.750" style="s2">obviously came to her attention after</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:47.009" style="s2">that face matched issue but you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.750" end="00:53:49.410" style="s2">they would write about his various</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.009" end="00:53:51.869" style="s2">projects and when they wanted someone to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.410" end="00:53:53.609" style="s2">comment on something you know about you</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.869" end="00:53:55.980" style="s2">know the web and products you know they</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.609" end="00:53:58.410" style="s2">would like fall to him and and even</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.980" end="00:54:00.539" style="s2">after he left Harvard obviously they</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.410" end="00:54:02.789" style="s2">covered the Facebook really really</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.539" end="00:54:06.660" style="s2">closely and you know we went out and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.789" end="00:54:09.670" style="s2">visited him in Palo Alto</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.660" end="00:54:11.530" style="s2">masterful public relations for a you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.670" end="00:54:12.940" style="s2">know 17 or 18 year old kid I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.530" end="00:54:14.950" style="s2">impressed I was never very good at</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.940" end="00:54:16.510" style="s2">public relations and he was way better</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.950" end="00:54:17.170" style="s2">than I ever was I&#39;ll say that when he</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.510" end="00:54:20.050" style="s2">was a pup</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.170" end="00:54:21.880" style="s2">also at Harvard again it was the subject</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.050" end="00:54:23.980" style="s2">of that you know not entirely accurate</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.880" end="00:54:25.450" style="s2">movie I forget what it was called was it</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.980" end="00:54:27.940" style="s2">called the social network maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.450" end="00:54:30.730" style="s2">yeah the social yeah yeah you delve into</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.940" end="00:54:34.050" style="s2">some degree the you know the story of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.730" end="00:54:36.910" style="s2">the Winklevoss twins Greenspan was</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.050" end="00:54:38.950" style="s2">Zuckerberg over the line and ripping</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.910" end="00:54:40.930" style="s2">them off it was at the hacker spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.950" end="00:54:43.060" style="s2">sharing ideas and seeing who comes up</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.930" end="00:54:46.690" style="s2">with something what&#39;s your take on that</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.060" end="00:54:49.180" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind yeah I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.690" end="00:54:52.150" style="s2">dwell on that you know too much but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.180" end="00:54:54.700" style="s2">had to look at it really you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.150" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">fashion you know do my own research and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.700" end="00:55:00.130" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple points there one is</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:02.470" style="s2">that the Winklevoss twins were not going</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.130" end="00:55:04.510" style="s2">to create a product that took the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.470" end="00:55:05.830" style="s2">by storm you know they were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.510" end="00:55:07.720" style="s2">clueless about how they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.830" end="00:55:10.120" style="s2">things you know they&#39;ve been you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.720" end="00:55:13.120" style="s2">like talking about the thing for a year</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.120" end="00:55:16.420" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t an original idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.120" end="00:55:18.550" style="s2">you know Friendster was already out lots</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.420" end="00:55:20.770" style="s2">of campuses had their equivalent of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.550" end="00:55:22.690" style="s2">Facebook so it wasn&#39;t a brilliant idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.770" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">there was something even on campus you</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.690" end="00:55:25.870" style="s2">mentioned a guy named Greenspan he had</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:29.140" style="s2">his own product</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.870" end="00:55:33.130" style="s2">but when Zuckerberg did do which you</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.140" end="00:55:35.320" style="s2">know was deceptive was he said that he</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.130" end="00:55:37.720" style="s2">would help the Winklevoss twins and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.320" end="00:55:39.550" style="s2">other guy for connect you is what they</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.720" end="00:55:43.630" style="s2">were calling him originally Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.550" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">connection to code up their program it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.630" end="00:55:49.630" style="s2">sort of telling that the the key person</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:51.820" style="s2">and you know that these people wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.630" end="00:55:55.090" style="s2">do you know was just someone they would</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.820" end="00:55:58.750" style="s2">hire or you know and as a jobber you</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.090" end="00:56:01.420" style="s2">know you know that they didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.750" end="00:56:02.950" style="s2">have the skills to do that crucial stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.420" end="00:56:04.660" style="s2">themselves and the design really was</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.950" end="00:56:08.290" style="s2">going to be everything in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.660" end="00:56:09.940" style="s2">success and for two months he said he</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.290" end="00:56:11.950" style="s2">was working on it and he really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.940" end="00:56:13.990" style="s2">work on it and he dragged his feet on it</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.950" end="00:56:15.400" style="s2">and he actually shared with some other</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.990" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">people and it&#39;s the messaging that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.400" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">that&#39;s is what he was doing that he was</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:20.930" style="s2">slowing them down</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:23.810" style="s2">but you know the two months difference</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.930" end="00:56:25.400" style="s2">that it made for Connect you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.810" end="00:56:26.990" style="s2">have made much difference anyway they</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.400" end="00:56:28.460" style="s2">had someone working on it before they</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.990" end="00:56:29.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t do anything they had someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.460" end="00:56:31.880" style="s2">working on afterwards it didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.750" end="00:56:34.430" style="s2">anything so as it turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.880" end="00:56:35.660" style="s2">Zuckerberg messing him up for two months</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.430" end="00:56:37.370" style="s2">was the best thing that ever happened to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.660" end="00:56:39.460" style="s2">them cuz I wound up getting millions and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.370" end="00:56:41.480" style="s2">millions of dollars in a settlement and</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.460" end="00:56:43.550" style="s2">of course they gripe that they should</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.480" end="00:56:46.130" style="s2">have gotten more but I think it was like</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.550" end="00:56:49.700" style="s2">a total bonanza for them and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.130" end="00:56:51.590" style="s2">absurd to say as they are saying and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.700" end="00:56:53.330" style="s2">their biographer keeps saying you know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.590" end="00:56:55.160" style="s2">guess another book out about them you</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.330" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">know that Mark Zuckerberg had it not</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.160" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">been for Mark Zuckerberg that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:57:00.010" style="s2">ridiculous I do give them some credit</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:02.360" style="s2">for being on the Bitcoin thing early</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.010" end="00:57:03.800" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.360" end="00:57:06.490" style="s2">reasonable take I mean it does strike me</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.800" end="00:57:09.020" style="s2">having read it and get in your book that</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.490" end="00:57:12.740" style="s2">Zuckerberg was a little more duplicity</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.020" end="00:57:15.470" style="s2">than one might like however the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.740" end="00:57:17.570" style="s2">probability of Winklevoss twins and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.470" end="00:57:19.600" style="s2">friends actually having created Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.570" end="00:57:22.970" style="s2">quickly when you look at all the odd</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.600" end="00:57:24.680" style="s2">luck and right place right time that</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.970" end="00:57:28.130" style="s2">Facebook had with exactly the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.680" end="00:57:29.540" style="s2">product idea seems unlikely yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.130" end="00:57:31.640" style="s2">an extraordinary number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.540" end="00:57:33.650" style="s2">have been made like super rich certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.640" end="00:57:36.680" style="s2">simply by being around they&#39;re involved</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.650" end="00:57:38.210" style="s2">with Mark Zuckerberg who like spend a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.680" end="00:57:40.970" style="s2">lot of their time complaining about it</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.210" end="00:57:43.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I found yeah you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.970" end="00:57:46.070" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s my next question was</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.340" end="00:57:47.960" style="s2">going to be people who were round very</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.070" end="00:57:49.820" style="s2">tightly with him early very tight and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.960" end="00:57:53.540" style="s2">more tightly than anybody and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.820" end="00:57:55.010" style="s2">their take on Zack Hughes and Moskovitz</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.540" end="00:57:58.430" style="s2">did you get a chance to talk to those</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.010" end="00:58:00.530" style="s2">guys Dustin Moskovitz who is probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.430" end="00:58:02.900" style="s2">the closest lieutenant in the early days</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.530" end="00:58:07.190" style="s2">of Facebook and he turned out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.900" end="00:58:09.530" style="s2">really a great executive a CTO of for</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.190" end="00:58:12.970" style="s2">Facebook in the early days when he left</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.530" end="00:58:17.560" style="s2">he has never been on the record as</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.970" end="00:58:21.050" style="s2">thrashing Facebook there is probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.560" end="00:58:24.290" style="s2">clues that he&#39;s not thrilled of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.050" end="00:58:27.470" style="s2">direction the Facebook took but you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.290" end="00:58:29.060" style="s2">he has a I there&#39;s a possibility and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.470" end="00:58:30.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know because I actually didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.060" end="00:58:32.630" style="s2">talk that to Dustin he you know can I</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.920" end="00:58:33.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s telling the hidden talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.630" end="00:58:35.510" style="s2">to me maybe because he didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.890" end="00:58:37.250" style="s2">have to express what he thought of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.510" end="00:58:40.760" style="s2">Facebook or maybe he just didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.250" end="00:58:42.500" style="s2">talk to me but maybe he feels this guy</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.760" end="00:58:44.330" style="s2">made me one of the richest people in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.500" end="00:58:46.100" style="s2">world is being ridiculous for me to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.330" end="00:58:48.860" style="s2">trash him other people didn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.100" end="00:58:50.630" style="s2">problem Chris Hughes you know walks away</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.860" end="00:58:53.180" style="s2">with hundreds of millions of dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.630" end="00:58:55.190" style="s2">has no problem you know for for</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.180" end="00:58:57.290" style="s2">basically doing something nothing dumb</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.190" end="00:59:00.530" style="s2">extraordinary at all you know what he</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.290" end="00:59:02.510" style="s2">brought to Facebook he was basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.530" end="00:59:05.330" style="s2">answered the phone and for press stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.510" end="00:59:07.100" style="s2">and and you know can did some other</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.330" end="00:59:09.860" style="s2">things which you know weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.100" end="00:59:11.930" style="s2">extraordinary but um you you know he was</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.860" end="00:59:15.260" style="s2">lucky enough to be involved as a founder</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.930" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">and now he&#39;s going around you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.260" end="00:59:18.800" style="s2">saying the Facebook should be broken up</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:21.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I mean you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.800" end="00:59:24.770" style="s2">allowed to express your opinion but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.860" end="00:59:27.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like a great karma thing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.770" end="00:59:28.760" style="s2">do it&#39;s not giving back the money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.350" end="00:59:29.870" style="s2">the thing if he said you know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.760" end="00:59:31.700" style="s2">here&#39;s about five hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.870" end="00:59:34.100" style="s2">dollars I&#39;m gonna give it all to charity</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.700" end="00:59:36.230" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna live like I would live</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.100" end="00:59:38.120" style="s2">otherwise right I&#39;m gonna give up this</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.230" end="00:59:40.400" style="s2">my nice house in Greenwich Village the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.120" end="00:59:42.620" style="s2">nice house in upstate New York and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:46.070" style="s2">know although other money I have and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.620" end="00:59:48.710" style="s2">know because it&#39;s dirty money is blood</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.070" end="00:59:52.610" style="s2">money they don&#39;t say that right and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.710" end="00:59:54.830" style="s2">know so I I think that the it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.610" end="00:59:57.140" style="s2">seem kind to me I don&#39;t know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.830" end="00:59:58.520" style="s2">although I will didn&#39;t notice that there</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.140" end="01:00:01.100" style="s2">weren&#39;t too many people that stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.520" end="01:00:03.320" style="s2">Zach or that he stuck with her for very</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.100" end="01:00:05.150" style="s2">long I mean he went through cleaning</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.320" end="01:00:08.330" style="s2">house yeah there are there some he went</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.150" end="01:00:10.100" style="s2">through cleaning house after Yahoo tried</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.330" end="01:00:12.890" style="s2">to buy Facebook for a billion dollars</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.100" end="01:00:16.010" style="s2">and the Zuckerberg didn&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.890" end="01:00:19.970" style="s2">that Zuckerberg eventually kept Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.010" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">as we know but he made a point of making</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.970" end="01:00:24.890" style="s2">sure that a lot of people around him who</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">were telling him sell sell sell were</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.890" end="01:00:30.500" style="s2">gone after that yeah that&#39;s the Octavian</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:33.110" style="s2">in him right you&#39;re either with me or</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.500" end="01:00:36.650" style="s2">you&#39;re not and that&#39;s also I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.110" end="01:00:39.770" style="s2">that was a tremendously huge octavian</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.650" end="01:00:41.240" style="s2">move was to turn down a billion dollars</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.770" end="01:00:43.220" style="s2">when it wasn&#39;t at all clear that your</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.240" end="01:00:45.110" style="s2">business was worth a billion but he saw</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.220" end="01:00:46.430" style="s2">it and he said that if you know he I</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.110" end="01:00:48.829" style="s2">think he saw that if he could</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.430" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">stick his ground and just relentlessly</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.829" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">focus and oh by the way have a night of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:54.859" style="s2">Long Knives and take out these people</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:56.359" style="s2">that didn&#39;t agree he had its fair chance</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.859" end="01:00:59.510" style="s2">to build something much more significant</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.359" end="01:01:01.609" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s a really big kind of world</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.510" end="01:01:06.020" style="s2">historical move and how old was he at</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.609" end="01:01:10.700" style="s2">that time 23 maybe if that yeah no no it</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.020" end="01:01:12.500" style="s2">was you know yeah 22 yeah it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.700" end="01:01:14.210" style="s2">got to give him some octavian points</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.500" end="01:01:15.890" style="s2">there for that move I sure as shit</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.210" end="01:01:17.869" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t my own entrepreneurial career</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.890" end="01:01:19.910" style="s2">was quite the opposite I built him to</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.869" end="01:01:21.980" style="s2">sell three to five years put the money</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.910" end="01:01:24.589" style="s2">in the bank on to the next one&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.980" end="01:01:27.609" style="s2">different game what&#39;s interesting is he</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.589" end="01:01:33.800" style="s2">took those lessons the way he felt and</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.609" end="01:01:36.800" style="s2">used it to get founders of other</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.800" end="01:01:39.140" style="s2">promising applications you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.800" end="01:01:41.059" style="s2">talking about what&#39;s up and Instagram</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.140" end="01:01:44.109" style="s2">and you know these are founders that</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.059" end="01:01:47.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to sell their operation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.109" end="01:01:49.550" style="s2">he got them to sell to him so you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.480" end="01:01:51.470" style="s2">these are people who want the same way</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.550" end="01:01:56.240" style="s2">he did but he understood how to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.470" end="01:01:59.210" style="s2">under their skin and to make them make</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.240" end="01:02:01.579" style="s2">the concession but he refused to make it</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.210" end="01:02:04.369" style="s2">on the other hand he just overpaid so</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.579" end="01:02:07.520" style="s2">crazily I&#39;m like he paid 19 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.369" end="01:02:09.710" style="s2">the capital value of Facebook for</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.520" end="01:02:12.230" style="s2">whatsapp and it still hasn&#39;t made any</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.710" end="01:02:14.390" style="s2">money right or very little I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.230" end="01:02:17.990" style="s2">there if you put up what&#39;s up for sale</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.390" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">for twenty billion dollars now you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.990" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">there would be a lot of takers and if</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.520" end="01:02:23.329" style="s2">you put it up what&#39;s up for sale for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:25.160" style="s2">hundred billion dollars you know the you</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.329" end="01:02:26.809" style="s2">know you I mean if it went public you</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.160" end="01:02:29.750" style="s2">know you could argue you can get a</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.809" end="01:02:32.180" style="s2">hundred billion dollars if it&#39;s a one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.750" end="01:02:35.089" style="s2">the most successful social applications</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.180" end="01:02:36.829" style="s2">in the world so that even at that level</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.089" end="01:02:38.359" style="s2">it&#39;s worth a lot it&#39;s worth a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.829" end="01:02:40.549" style="s2">to Facebook because they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.359" end="01:02:42.559" style="s2">appeal against it exactly that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.549" end="01:02:45.020" style="s2">they actually did it right to basically</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.559" end="01:02:47.869" style="s2">co-op competition and then oculus the</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.020" end="01:02:50.990" style="s2">other case again two billion dollars for</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.869" end="01:02:52.670" style="s2">very early impressive but not clear what</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.990" end="01:02:55.069" style="s2">the market was really hasn&#39;t turned into</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.670" end="01:02:57.290" style="s2">a hell of a lot he did it by brute force</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.069" end="01:02:59.840" style="s2">and I would say the essentially</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.290" end="01:03:02.540" style="s2">anti-competitive nature of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.840" end="01:03:05.780" style="s2">zap made a lot of sense but I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.540" end="01:03:08.090" style="s2">fault the founders of whatsapp at all</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.780" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">for turning down when you&#39;re a 40-person</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.090" end="01:03:12.140" style="s2">company being paid you know 20 billion</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:13.820" style="s2">dollars is a ridiculous so he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.140" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">overwhelmed them nobody offered</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.820" end="01:03:17.270" style="s2">Zuckerberg a payout quite like that he</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:20.360" style="s2">probably would have taken it maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.270" end="01:03:22.610" style="s2">but he oh he got Instagram for a billion</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.360" end="01:03:25.010" style="s2">dollars which was what the offer was for</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.610" end="01:03:27.770" style="s2">him from Yahoo so that&#39;s a good example</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.010" end="01:03:30.800" style="s2">that&#39;s more equivalent he found founders</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.770" end="01:03:33.490" style="s2">who weren&#39;t as Octavian as he was</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.800" end="01:03:36.620" style="s2">essentially yeah you know and the big</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.490" end="01:03:40.010" style="s2">thing that he was gonna concede to them</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.620" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">was independence you know they could</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.010" end="01:03:46.100" style="s2">still run it like they owned it which</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:49.580" style="s2">they did for a while until he decided</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.100" end="01:03:53.140" style="s2">that those days were over and you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.580" end="01:03:56.330" style="s2">I&#39;m in charge now and Instagram now</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.140" end="01:03:58.820" style="s2">exists will serve Facebook but what you</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.330" end="01:04:00.860" style="s2">would expect eventually right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.820" end="01:04:03.740" style="s2">nature of selling your company exactly</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.860" end="01:04:06.590" style="s2">so the founders of both what&#39;s up and</p>

<p begin="01:04:52.640" end="01:04:58.460" style="s2">Shawn Parker and his insight that it was</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.970" end="01:05:01.460" style="s2">the fact that Facebook was based on real</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.460" end="01:05:03.980" style="s2">names only unlike the other social media</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.460" end="01:05:05.990" style="s2">platforms that made it so important how</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.980" end="01:05:08.690" style="s2">formative do you think that Casa</p>

<p begin="01:05:08.690" end="01:05:14.710" style="s2">epoch was in making Zuckerberg who is</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.430" end="01:05:18.339" style="s2">well I think what happened in that</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.710" end="01:05:22.599" style="s2">period this is you know a few months</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.339" end="01:05:24.220" style="s2">after the Facebook started the team</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.599" end="01:05:27.160" style="s2">moved the Silicon Valley for the summer</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.220" end="01:05:29.230" style="s2">ostensibly and you know they ran into</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.160" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">Sean Parker who had a lot of experience</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.230" end="01:05:32.470" style="s2">even though was a only a few years older</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:35.200" style="s2">than them</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.470" end="01:05:37.809" style="s2">in in the valley had been a mobster and</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.200" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">he started a company called Plaxo which</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.809" end="01:05:44.020" style="s2">he sort of screwed out of by the VC</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">funders em then they got in touch</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.020" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">through Parker with people like Reed</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:55.029" style="s2">Hoffman and more thinkest so immediately</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:57.730" style="s2">they were talking to the most important</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.029" end="01:06:01.119" style="s2">people in Silicon Valley who understood</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.730" end="01:06:03.520" style="s2">social networking and and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.119" end="01:06:06.640" style="s2">understood the ecosystem how do I get in</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.520" end="01:06:09.819" style="s2">touch with funders and very quickly by</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.640" end="01:06:11.529" style="s2">the end of that summer they had funding</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.819" end="01:06:15.099" style="s2">a you know from Peter Thiel you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.529" end="01:06:18.730" style="s2">millions of dollars and in Hoffman and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.099" end="01:06:21.609" style="s2">Pincus put their own money in so that</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.730" end="01:06:24.160" style="s2">was important but just as important was</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.609" end="01:06:26.410" style="s2">Zuckerberg being exposed to that growth</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:28.150" style="s2">mentality of Silicon Valley you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.410" end="01:06:32.410" style="s2">Zuckerberg as we talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.150" end="01:06:34.319" style="s2">was very big on expansion and growth but</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.410" end="01:06:37.660" style="s2">he really saw how not gonna be possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.319" end="01:06:39.609" style="s2">by really getting in touch with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.660" end="01:06:42.789" style="s2">people who were the cutting edge of</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.609" end="01:06:44.440" style="s2">growth hacking in in in the valley and</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.789" end="01:06:47.589" style="s2">and he began to think about what</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.440" end="01:06:49.960" style="s2">Facebook could be beyond a campus</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.589" end="01:06:52.150" style="s2">network and I actually got hold of his</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.960" end="01:06:54.819" style="s2">secret notebook where he was writing his</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.150" end="01:06:57.130" style="s2">visions for Facebook in 2006 of how to</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.819" end="01:06:58.660" style="s2">change it from a campus network to</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.130" end="01:07:01.779" style="s2">something where everyone in the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.660" end="01:07:03.190" style="s2">would have it so I think those years and</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.779" end="01:07:05.380" style="s2">those connections were very formative</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.190" end="01:07:06.789" style="s2">for him yeah I love this notebook and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.380" end="01:07:09.400" style="s2">your references to it do you actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.789" end="01:07:11.440" style="s2">have his notebook I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.400" end="01:07:13.480" style="s2">physical notebook but I have some he</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.440" end="01:07:15.220" style="s2">destroyed it but I I have the copies of</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.480" end="01:07:17.289" style="s2">the pages which he doesn&#39;t have anymore</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.220" end="01:07:19.539" style="s2">so you know I I showed it to him</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.289" end="01:07:21.309" style="s2">eventually and he couldn&#39;t believe it</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.539" end="01:07:24.400" style="s2">cuz he&#39;s well I&#39;m looking at this I</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.309" end="01:07:26.359" style="s2">don&#39;t have it I&#39;m sorry I got rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.400" end="01:07:28.099" style="s2">interesting cuz I actually have a note</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.359" end="01:07:29.750" style="s2">board for one of my ventures it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.099" end="01:07:31.579" style="s2">my prized possessions it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.750" end="01:07:32.990" style="s2">French little paper books with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.579" end="01:07:34.250" style="s2">flexible covers what do you call them I</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.990" end="01:07:35.930" style="s2">forget but anyway the beautiful little</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.250" end="01:07:38.089" style="s2">note book and it&#39;s absolutely full of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.930" end="01:07:40.369" style="s2">stuff and I still go back and look at it</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.089" end="01:07:43.069" style="s2">and go holy moly if I had the notebook</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.369" end="01:07:45.170" style="s2">for Facebook from 2006 it would be one</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.069" end="01:07:47.329" style="s2">of my prized possessions did he ever ask</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.170" end="01:07:50.390" style="s2">you for the copy I should actually just</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.329" end="01:07:52.040" style="s2">I should send you my promise I said to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.390" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">me after the book game what I think I</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.040" end="01:07:55.609" style="s2">would all do that yeah if I was him I</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:57.799" style="s2">would find that to be a prized</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.609" end="01:07:59.630" style="s2">possession let&#39;s go back to talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.799" end="01:08:02.780" style="s2">about the insight that Shawn Parker had</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.630" end="01:08:04.339" style="s2">about real names I was a little late to</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.780" end="01:08:07.430" style="s2">the day on Facebook I think I joined in</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.339" end="01:08:09.530" style="s2">2009 and previously I had skipped</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.430" end="01:08:11.930" style="s2">Friendster but I had yeah little</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.530" end="01:08:14.780" style="s2">investment my myspace account and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.930" end="01:08:17.000" style="s2">what-have-you and that was my reaction</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.780" end="01:08:19.819" style="s2">also well when I took a look at Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.000" end="01:08:23.210" style="s2">in 2009 I go wow this could be a much</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.819" end="01:08:25.759" style="s2">better ecosystem because these guys have</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.210" end="01:08:29.480" style="s2">figured out how to have a reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.759" end="01:08:32.779" style="s2">strong real name ID and not you know the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.480" end="01:08:35.150" style="s2">crazed myspace thing with all anonymity</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.779" end="01:08:37.910" style="s2">that was ugly and too easily to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.150" end="01:08:40.730" style="s2">spammable etc I still believe to this</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.910" end="01:08:44.630" style="s2">day that the thing that let Facebook win</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.730" end="01:08:47.540" style="s2">at around that time 2008-2009 was that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.630" end="01:08:49.819" style="s2">the choice of real name identity was</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.540" end="01:08:51.620" style="s2">really different than what most people</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.819" end="01:08:53.870" style="s2">do look at reddit for instance again</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.620" end="01:08:56.750" style="s2">similar time frame you know reddit has</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.870" end="01:08:59.779" style="s2">always been rigorously anonymous if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.750" end="01:09:01.339" style="s2">want to be Twitter the same but real</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.779" end="01:09:03.799" style="s2">names make a big difference you know you</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.339" end="01:09:06.380" style="s2">and I are both on the well and the well</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.799" end="01:09:08.330" style="s2">was famous from the very beginning no</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.380" end="01:09:11.509" style="s2">matter how big a celebrity you are you</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.330" end="01:09:13.699" style="s2">shall use your real name and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.509" end="01:09:15.699" style="s2">allow the well to conquer the world but</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.699" end="01:09:18.440" style="s2">it did make for a very much better</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.699" end="01:09:21.469" style="s2">ecosystem than systems built around</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.440" end="01:09:24.500" style="s2">confidentiality how central do you think</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.469" end="01:09:27.109" style="s2">real names is to the Zuckerberg vision I</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.500" end="01:09:29.900" style="s2">think is important I think that one</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.109" end="01:09:33.049" style="s2">reason why there have a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.900" end="01:09:34.850" style="s2">now is they have the scale the Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.049" end="01:09:36.049" style="s2">operates it&#39;s tough to police that to</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.850" end="01:09:37.970" style="s2">make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.049" end="01:09:40.130" style="s2">everyone who is who they say they are</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.970" end="01:09:42.440" style="s2">there&#39;s like five Facebook amidst the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.130" end="01:09:46.210" style="s2">five percent of the accounts are bogus</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.440" end="01:09:49.549" style="s2">accounts and they report in eye popping</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.210" end="01:09:52.100" style="s2">numbers of attempts to create fake</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.549" end="01:09:55.310" style="s2">accounts billions of you know every</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.100" end="01:09:56.570" style="s2">quarter so you know kind of course a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.310" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">of those are basically just bought</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.570" end="01:10:02.030" style="s2">trying to you know open one account</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:04.880" style="s2">after another but uh even 5% can cause a</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.030" end="01:10:09.020" style="s2">lot of problems I I think it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:12.530" style="s2">important to know that when someone yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.020" end="01:10:14.750" style="s2">if your identity is if it&#39;s who you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.530" end="01:10:16.760" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be generally more</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.750" end="01:10:20.420" style="s2">careful about what you post then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.760" end="01:10:22.580" style="s2">gonna be answerable to it when you break</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.420" end="01:10:24.770" style="s2">the rules Facebook I think could be</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.580" end="01:10:26.450" style="s2">tougher about enforcing that but I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.770" end="01:10:29.180" style="s2">that they don&#39;t want to have their</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.450" end="01:10:32.330" style="s2">numbers go down if they&#39;re too tough</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.180" end="01:10:35.600" style="s2">they don&#39;t want it anyone turned away as</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.330" end="01:10:39.620" style="s2">a false positive fakery</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.600" end="01:10:42.350" style="s2">so that 5% which is you know probably</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.620" end="01:10:44.420" style="s2">the minimum is a big problem for them</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.350" end="01:10:47.210" style="s2">because it it&#39;s a better community for</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.420" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">all if everyone you know like knows who</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.210" end="01:10:50.780" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:52.310" style="s2">right just like if you know uh people</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.780" end="01:10:54.530" style="s2">walked around and you couldn&#39;t tell who</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.310" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">they were they might be less polite it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.530" end="01:10:57.950" style="s2">like I said if you&#39;re in a small town</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:10:59.930" style="s2">you know who everyone is you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.950" end="01:11:02.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a big incentive to behave better</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.930" end="01:11:04.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s your reputation absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.870" end="01:11:06.920" style="s2">and I do find it interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.510" end="01:11:08.690" style="s2">despite the fact the you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.920" end="01:11:11.510" style="s2">essentially utterly immense financial</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.690" end="01:11:14.750" style="s2">resources that Facebook has it has not</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.510" end="01:11:17.330" style="s2">tried to upgrade the quality of its real</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.750" end="01:11:18.950" style="s2">name identity and in fact this I found</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.330" end="01:11:21.410" style="s2">very curious they&#39;ve essentially as I</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.950" end="01:11:23.390" style="s2">understand it closed off their program</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.410" end="01:11:25.970" style="s2">of the equivalent of Twitter&#39;s blue</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.390" end="01:11:27.530" style="s2">check because you know there is an</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.970" end="01:11:29.450" style="s2">argument that you don&#39;t want to close</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.530" end="01:11:31.280" style="s2">the front door with too rigorous of</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.450" end="01:11:33.020" style="s2">screening and I think Zuckerberg has</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.280" end="01:11:35.000" style="s2">said elsewhere that he&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.020" end="01:11:36.740" style="s2">concerned about the third world where</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.000" end="01:11:38.870" style="s2">people don&#39;t necessarily have firm</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.740" end="01:11:40.670" style="s2">documentary identity you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.870" end="01:11:42.560" style="s2">United States easy enough have people</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.670" end="01:11:44.450" style="s2">you know send a picture of their drivers</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.560" end="01:11:47.060" style="s2">license or their you know other</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.450" end="01:11:48.650" style="s2">government ID but in you know Uganda</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.060" end="01:11:49.700" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to work so well but</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.650" end="01:11:52.820" style="s2">however you could have</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.700" end="01:11:55.730" style="s2">upgraded ID yeah also to be fair</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.820" end="01:11:57.710" style="s2">Facebook ran into a lot of problems of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.730" end="01:12:00.170" style="s2">people who had good reason not to use</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.710" end="01:12:02.510" style="s2">their real identities you know people</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.170" end="01:12:04.310" style="s2">who you know might have you know had</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.510" end="01:12:07.700" style="s2">sexual identity that they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.310" end="01:12:11.000" style="s2">share with everyone so that was a real</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.700" end="01:12:12.530" style="s2">dilemma for them and they decided since</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.000" end="01:12:14.300" style="s2">facebook was so important to people they</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.530" end="01:12:16.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t deny people access to that so</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.300" end="01:12:18.740" style="s2">you know and in that case they had a</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.280" end="01:12:20.720" style="s2">genuine dilemma yeah there would be good</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.740" end="01:12:23.390" style="s2">if they seems to me it&#39;d be really good</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.720" end="01:12:25.820" style="s2">to me if they would go and offer two or</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.390" end="01:12:28.100" style="s2">three levels of augmented identity right</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.820" end="01:12:29.600" style="s2">maybe charge for it charge ten bucks to</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.100" end="01:12:31.790" style="s2">go through the yeah the know your</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:34.220" style="s2">customer level or you could you could</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.790" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">then make your own setting to say I only</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.220" end="01:12:40.460" style="s2">want to interact with people who have</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:41.960" style="s2">been vetted sort of like the you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.460" end="01:12:44.210" style="s2">trust the traveler program or something</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.960" end="01:12:46.250" style="s2">like that yeah I mean if it seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.210" end="01:12:48.110" style="s2">natural thing to do but probably they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.250" end="01:12:49.940" style="s2">computer simulations show that it would</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.110" end="01:12:51.220" style="s2">you know ones wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.940" end="01:12:53.180" style="s2">growth I&#39;ll tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.220" end="01:12:55.460" style="s2">exactly and that&#39;s all it&#39;s about and</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.180" end="01:12:58.250" style="s2">what&#39;s it by next topic the next kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.460" end="01:13:00.860" style="s2">strikingly influential individual that</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.250" end="01:13:03.680" style="s2">Zuck hooked up with was Peter teal and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.860" end="01:13:05.600" style="s2">you tell the story that one of teals</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.680" end="01:13:06.230" style="s2">guys I think it was her friend of teals</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.600" end="01:13:09.950" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.230" end="01:13:12.590" style="s2">focused on the unbelievably amazing and</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.950" end="01:13:14.890" style="s2">rapidly growing engagement numbers of</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.590" end="01:13:18.350" style="s2">Facebook even in those early days and</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.890" end="01:13:20.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what hooked teal to be the first</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.350" end="01:13:23.300" style="s2">significant investor and as we talked</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.420" end="01:13:26.120" style="s2">about earlier worshiping engagement in</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.300" end="01:13:28.610" style="s2">some sense became the dark hole into</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.120" end="01:13:32.150" style="s2">which facebook has fallen or did fall</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.610" end="01:13:36.290" style="s2">any thoughts on Zuckerberg and teal well</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.150" end="01:13:39.200" style="s2">teal you know was the first big investor</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.290" end="01:13:42.500" style="s2">and he has been a board member you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.200" end="01:13:45.670" style="s2">for the Facebook&#39;s history and I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.500" end="01:13:50.120" style="s2">as a trusted advisor to Zuckerberg and</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.670" end="01:13:52.400" style="s2">you know he is long advocated the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.120" end="01:13:54.920" style="s2">companies do best when they have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.400" end="01:13:58.070" style="s2">monopoly when a corner of the market</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.920" end="01:13:59.900" style="s2">send that map thinking if it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.070" end="01:14:02.030" style="s2">influence Zuckerberg it certainly syncs</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.900" end="01:14:03.180" style="s2">with the way Facebook is behaved over</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.030" end="01:14:06.240" style="s2">the years</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.180" end="01:14:08.280" style="s2">yeah and I will say I know teal just a</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.240" end="01:14:11.190" style="s2">little bit and I would say he&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.280" end="01:14:13.050" style="s2">really ruthless dude you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.190" end="01:14:16.050" style="s2">interesting guy interesting guy I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.050" end="01:14:17.310" style="s2">back you know back when and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.050" end="01:14:20.130" style="s2">early days of Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.310" end="01:14:22.230" style="s2">tl was one of those people that he had a</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.130" end="01:14:24.780" style="s2">PR person who would call you all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.230" end="01:14:26.280" style="s2">time and say Peters available to comment</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.780" end="01:14:26.520" style="s2">on this Peter&#39;s available to comment on</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.280" end="01:14:29.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.520" end="01:14:31.680" style="s2">no he won&#39;t talk to journalists but um</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.160" end="01:14:34.320" style="s2">back then he was eager to get his name</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.680" end="01:14:36.720" style="s2">out one of the things that you call out</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.320" end="01:14:38.790" style="s2">of course its famous about Facebook it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.720" end="01:14:40.710" style="s2">move fast and break things but you also</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.790" end="01:14:41.910" style="s2">dig into the fact that it&#39;s not just an</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.710" end="01:14:44.190" style="s2">attitude to move fast and break things</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.910" end="01:14:46.530" style="s2">but also that they were one of the early</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.190" end="01:14:49.380" style="s2">companies that heavily invested in what</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.530" end="01:14:51.630" style="s2">we now call DevOps where you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.380" end="01:14:53.850" style="s2">months to bring out a feature it takes</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.630" end="01:14:54.810" style="s2">hours to push a feature into production</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.850" end="01:14:57.960" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t work you pull it back</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.810" end="01:14:59.430" style="s2">right where did that ethos come from is</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.960" end="01:15:02.340" style="s2">that Zuckerberg himself was that</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.430" end="01:15:04.410" style="s2">Moskovitz some kind of group think that</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.340" end="01:15:06.750" style="s2">realized the strategic importance of</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.410" end="01:15:09.150" style="s2">DevOps and very rapid pushing of</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.750" end="01:15:11.100" style="s2">features out yeah we touched them out</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.150" end="01:15:14.160" style="s2">earlier I mean I was a huge advantage</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.100" end="01:15:16.980" style="s2">for Facebook in in the early days</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.160" end="01:15:18.240" style="s2">did you know they understood you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.980" end="01:15:20.640" style="s2">coming from Zuckerberg is used to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.240" end="01:15:22.770" style="s2">tools and and he taught those tools the</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.640" end="01:15:24.690" style="s2">Moskovitz who really wasn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.770" end="01:15:25.980" style="s2">that much of a coder when he started age</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.690" end="01:15:29.820" style="s2">is really want to become part of it and</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.980" end="01:15:31.080" style="s2">he learned it very quickly then this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.820" end="01:15:34.200" style="s2">something people do people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.080" end="01:15:36.870" style="s2">realize this people grew up in the PC</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.200" end="01:15:40.530" style="s2">age in the Microsoft way of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.870" end="01:15:42.690" style="s2">things that you would do an upgrade like</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.530" end="01:15:45.540" style="s2">every year or every couple years and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.690" end="01:15:48.390" style="s2">can do you know sort of Inc from mental</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.540" end="01:15:50.280" style="s2">you know thought upgrades you know like</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.390" end="01:15:53.240" style="s2">every few months they didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.280" end="01:15:56.130" style="s2">that it was possible to do upgrades</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.240" end="01:15:57.990" style="s2">several times a day and you could push</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.130" end="01:15:59.310" style="s2">stuff out and the advantages if</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.990" end="01:16:01.050" style="s2">something didn&#39;t work if there was a bug</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.310" end="01:16:03.510" style="s2">you could just have the new version</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.050" end="01:16:06.720" style="s2">ready that would refresh the next time</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.510" end="01:16:10.290" style="s2">people you know open the browser yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.720" end="01:16:12.120" style="s2">and this is a great advantage of not</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.290" end="01:16:14.520" style="s2">being bound by the previous paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.120" end="01:16:15.990" style="s2">that Facebook took advantage of then</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.520" end="01:16:16.970" style="s2">enable it to move much quicker than</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.990" end="01:16:19.650" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.970" end="01:16:21.840" style="s2">yeah and I will say my own business</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.650" end="01:16:24.240" style="s2">theory when I was a entrepreneur was I</p>

<p begin="01:16:28.980" end="01:16:32.250" style="s2">competitive advantage and they took it</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.390" end="01:16:34.680" style="s2">to the next level course Google had also</p>

<p begin="01:17:41.760" end="01:17:47.250" style="s2">yeah well the the move fast and break</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.040" end="01:17:49.050" style="s2">things originally was meant to talk</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.250" end="01:17:52.140" style="s2">about we were just talking about the</p>

<p begin="01:17:53.580" end="01:17:59.070" style="s2">okay because you know in an hour we&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="01:18:10.610" end="01:18:16.830" style="s2">and so you could have a product that</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.380" end="01:18:19.710" style="s2">broke privacy and then fix it later</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.830" end="01:18:22.620" style="s2">and you know you could break Myanmar and</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.710" end="01:18:25.470" style="s2">fix it later and that Matt and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:18:52.170" end="01:18:58.920" style="s2">Jacques in some ways may be a precursor</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.740" end="01:19:01.860" style="s2">was the fairly prescient realization by</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.920" end="01:19:03.720" style="s2">Pierre Omidyar that he needed a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.860" end="01:19:06.090" style="s2">help and brought in Meg Whitman at a</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.720" end="01:19:07.890" style="s2">very early stage and you know though I</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.090" end="01:19:10.110" style="s2">do think the the partnership there was</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.890" end="01:19:12.330" style="s2">more one-sided toward Meg rather than</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.110" end="01:19:15.510" style="s2">Pierre over time but it&#39;s a some degree</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.330" end="01:19:17.310" style="s2">suck as you point out also said here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.510" end="01:19:19.410" style="s2">big round circle around shit I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.290" end="01:19:27.540" style="s2">not at the levels up that I would always</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.720" end="01:19:29.610" style="s2">hire a very strong CFO and I joke with</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.540" end="01:19:31.410" style="s2">them hey your job is to be the king of</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.060" end="01:19:48.400" style="s2">started how its matured and where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.440" end="01:19:50.170" style="s2">at today</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.400" end="01:19:52.420" style="s2">yeah I talked about them both</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.170" end="01:19:54.850" style="s2">considerably about this you know about</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.420" end="01:19:57.460" style="s2">the decision you know and they he</p>

<p begin="01:20:00.670" end="01:20:08.110" style="s2">brilliant business person so she did</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.750" end="01:20:10.600" style="s2">have role as a show or reminded me when</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.110" end="01:20:13.210" style="s2">we talked the you know that she had a</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.600" end="01:20:15.700" style="s2">company-wide role in helping with the</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.210" end="01:20:19.090" style="s2">culture of Facebook moving in little off</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.700" end="01:20:21.640" style="s2">the dorm-room culture and being you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.090" end="01:20:24.130" style="s2">friendlier to women in particular and</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.640" end="01:20:27.940" style="s2">and being a little more socially</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.130" end="01:20:30.220" style="s2">conscious in terms of place to work but</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.940" end="01:20:32.350" style="s2">they actually divided up the company and</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.220" end="01:20:34.330" style="s2">and as just as you said there were</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.350" end="01:20:35.680" style="s2">things that Zuckerberg wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.330" end="01:20:38.440" style="s2">interested in he was interested in</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.680" end="01:20:40.480" style="s2">engineering and product and that was</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.440" end="01:20:42.780" style="s2">what was going to be what where he spent</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.480" end="01:20:46.930" style="s2">his time and the rest of its sales</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.780" end="01:20:49.030" style="s2">lobbying in Washington HR while content</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.930" end="01:20:53.020" style="s2">moderation that went over to the Sheryl</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.030" end="01:20:54.520" style="s2">side and that was her world that she</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.020" end="01:20:58.090" style="s2">would run and and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.520" end="01:21:01.090" style="s2">disincentive for her to flag problems in</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.090" end="01:21:03.370" style="s2">her world to him she felt that she</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.090" end="01:21:05.050" style="s2">should be dealing with them herself but</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.370" end="01:21:07.450" style="s2">there are some problems that are so</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.050" end="01:21:08.800" style="s2">important that the CEO really needs a</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.450" end="01:21:10.870" style="s2">deal with it the company doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.800" end="01:21:12.790" style="s2">take it seriously until they see the</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.870" end="01:21:15.460" style="s2">signal that wait a minute this see this</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.790" end="01:21:18.010" style="s2">is a CEO level issue and that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.460" end="01:21:20.530" style="s2">things like what happened in the 2016</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.010" end="01:21:24.400" style="s2">election the this stuff was in Cheryl&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.530" end="01:21:26.560" style="s2">world and it was not dealt with from a</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.400" end="01:21:28.330" style="s2">CEO level and it really should have been</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.560" end="01:21:30.070" style="s2">is because it turns out these are the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.330" end="01:21:33.040" style="s2">things that had terrible impact on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.070" end="01:21:34.780" style="s2">company over the next few years as it</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.040" end="01:21:37.450" style="s2">also turns out of course when you do</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.780" end="01:21:40.150" style="s2">that division you miss the overlap which</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.450" end="01:21:42.250" style="s2">is as we talked about earlier if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.150" end="01:21:45.220" style="s2">build a product which was Zuckerberg</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.250" end="01:21:47.680" style="s2">domain that uses machine learning to</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.220" end="01:21:49.900" style="s2">identify cognitively button-pushing</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.680" end="01:21:51.810" style="s2">content that&#39;s gonna have policy</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.900" end="01:21:54.010" style="s2">implications right so you can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.810" end="01:21:55.990" style="s2">firewall those two things out and</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.010" end="01:21:58.480" style="s2">perhaps that conversation didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.990" end="01:22:00.700" style="s2">if they firewall to two divisions too</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.480" end="01:22:01.570" style="s2">strongly right right yeah I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.700" end="01:22:04.150" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like there was no</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.570" end="01:22:06.940" style="s2">but like the AI people reported a Zuka</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.150" end="01:22:11.380" style="s2">burg and they gave the tools to the data</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.940" end="01:22:14.530" style="s2">people who work for assembler so it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.380" end="01:22:17.190" style="s2">and we sold from Sandberg&#39;s organization</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.530" end="01:22:20.500" style="s2">so there was this disconnect between</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.190" end="01:22:23.920" style="s2">them and another thing that was in wound</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.500" end="01:22:25.960" style="s2">up in Cheryl&#39;s world was security the</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.920" end="01:22:27.670" style="s2">chief security officer reported to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.960" end="01:22:29.590" style="s2">general council who reported to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.670" end="01:22:31.719" style="s2">policy person who reported to Sheryl</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.590" end="01:22:33.489" style="s2">Sandberg well wait a minute your chief</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.719" end="01:22:36.130" style="s2">security officer the person with the C</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.489" end="01:22:39.639" style="s2">and his title you know how many steps is</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.130" end="01:22:42.400" style="s2">away not from the CEO Oh Sheryl and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.639" end="01:22:45.790" style="s2">he&#39;s a step farther even farther away a</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.400" end="01:22:48.520" style="s2">big gap between him and the CEO you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.790" end="01:22:50.710" style="s2">can I was shocked to find that the chief</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.520" end="01:22:53.730" style="s2">security officer never had a one-on-one</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.710" end="01:22:55.989" style="s2">with Mark Zuckerberg you imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.730" end="01:22:58.449" style="s2">I&#39;d remember reading that in your book</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.989" end="01:23:00.790" style="s2">and I was utterly shocked you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.449" end="01:23:02.860" style="s2">was CEO of network solutions and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.790" end="01:23:05.770" style="s2">later division president for Vera signs</p>

<p begin="01:23:05.770" end="01:23:11.650" style="s2">was absolutely at the top of my list</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.040" end="01:23:13.869" style="s2">right and while we didn&#39;t call them</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.650" end="01:23:16.420" style="s2">chief security officers in those days</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.869" end="01:23:18.340" style="s2">with the C titles were no longer or</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.420" end="01:23:21.810" style="s2">nowhere near as promiscuous as they are</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.340" end="01:23:24.159" style="s2">these days Zuckerberg cut back on C</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.810" end="01:23:25.960" style="s2">recent years you didn&#39;t want any other</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.159" end="01:23:27.369" style="s2">C&#39;s well I think that&#39;s a damn good</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.960" end="01:23:29.739" style="s2">thing but I would certainly have a</p>

<p begin="01:24:10.929" end="01:24:15.219" style="s2">stages of my book and one of them I said</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.219" end="01:24:19.630" style="s2">is meticulously for every interaction</p>

<p begin="01:24:50.110" end="01:24:54.280" style="s2">years and it was clear to me you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.969" end="01:24:56.260" style="s2">that she is a believer in Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.280" end="01:24:58.060" style="s2">she&#39;s a very exacting person she could</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.260" end="01:25:00.310" style="s2">be tough on her subordinates but she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.060" end="01:25:03.310" style="s2">toughest on herself and she&#39;s in great</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.310" end="01:25:05.650" style="s2">pain then she didn&#39;t perform in every</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.310" end="01:25:08.739" style="s2">aspect as well and she could of doing</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.650" end="01:25:10.300" style="s2">this crisis you know leading up to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.739" end="01:25:12.969" style="s2">crisis she could it should have been a</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.300" end="01:25:15.130" style="s2">more on top of things that prevent stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.969" end="01:25:17.320" style="s2">from happening so this was painful there</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.130" end="01:25:19.420" style="s2">and it is part of this very human story</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.320" end="01:25:22.180" style="s2">of Facebook and that&#39;s really what I</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.420" end="01:25:24.760" style="s2">tried to do in this book is tell that</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.180" end="01:25:27.400" style="s2">story of you know without demonizing</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.760" end="01:25:30.340" style="s2">people but you know showing them is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.400" end="01:25:31.750" style="s2">flawed human beings they are who can do</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.340" end="01:25:34.600" style="s2">things something extraordinary like</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.750" end="01:25:37.420" style="s2">building this company that has now three</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.600" end="01:25:39.310" style="s2">billion people using its products in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.420" end="01:25:43.420" style="s2">world as a huge percentage of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.310" end="01:25:45.370" style="s2">world&#39;s population yet as well as it did</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.420" end="01:25:46.930" style="s2">a lot of good it caused a lot of harm</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.370" end="01:25:49.989" style="s2">and they&#39;re grappling with that and and</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.930" end="01:25:52.210" style="s2">and then you know they throw men at a</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.989" end="01:25:54.370" style="s2">lot of ill-will so how did that happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.210" end="01:25:57.250" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a tragic story in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.370" end="01:26:00.489" style="s2">and you know god I hope people could</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.250" end="01:26:02.680" style="s2">like read this like the story it is and</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.489" end="01:26:04.810" style="s2">a very important story because Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.680" end="01:26:07.960" style="s2">is so important to us and Instagram and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.810" end="01:26:09.219" style="s2">Facebook and we scream what&#39;s up you</p>

<p begin="01:26:20.890" end="01:26:26.440" style="s2">price for ambition you know can may be</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.530" end="01:26:29.110" style="s2">too much ambition yeah indeed I would</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.440" end="01:26:31.960" style="s2">strongly recommend this book to my</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.110" end="01:26:33.310" style="s2">because as Steven says it&#39;s a story it</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.960" end="01:26:36.550" style="s2">draws you in</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.310" end="01:26:39.580" style="s2">it&#39;s full of you know human conflict</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.550" end="01:26:41.350" style="s2">human foibles the profiles of Sheryl</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.580" end="01:26:43.719" style="s2">Sandberg someone I probably knew a lot</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.350" end="01:26:46.179" style="s2">less about than Zuckerberg we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.719" end="01:26:48.730" style="s2">illuminating so double thumbs up on</p>

<p begin="01:26:54.880" end="01:26:59.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve gotten your head into this more</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.590" end="01:27:02.830" style="s2">deeply than anybody you have you know 40</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.770" end="01:27:05.590" style="s2">years experience in the evolution of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.830" end="01:27:09.280" style="s2">techno sphere what do you think is next</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.590" end="01:27:12.400" style="s2">for Facebook as a company well as I</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.280" end="01:27:15.639" style="s2">started talking about this book you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.400" end="01:27:19.060" style="s2">I had a book tour cut short by this</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.639" end="01:27:22.889" style="s2">pandemic and it&#39;s been very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.060" end="01:27:25.510" style="s2">to see the impact of that on Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.889" end="01:27:27.369" style="s2">weirdly I mean I don&#39;t want to say you</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.510" end="01:27:29.739" style="s2">know obviously it&#39;s a terrible thing to</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.369" end="01:27:32.860" style="s2">benefit it was something that&#39;s caused</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.739" end="01:27:35.469" style="s2">like death and financial hardship on so</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.860" end="01:27:37.449" style="s2">many people but people have turned to</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.469" end="01:27:39.159" style="s2">Facebook in a way they have in in recent</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.449" end="01:27:41.050" style="s2">years some people who very</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.159" end="01:27:42.969" style="s2">self-consciously deleted Facebook cuz</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.050" end="01:27:44.679" style="s2">they thought it was toxic and no good</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.969" end="01:27:47.290" style="s2">for the world are now coming back</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.679" end="01:27:49.389" style="s2">because it it turns out to be one of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.290" end="01:27:52.719" style="s2">more effective tools for being in touch</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.389" end="01:27:55.869" style="s2">with people and what I&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.719" end="01:27:58.030" style="s2">pressing Zuckerberg to tell us is is</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.869" end="01:28:01.000" style="s2">this going to change maybe the way he</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.030" end="01:28:03.159" style="s2">sees Facebook the way go back to a maybe</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.000" end="01:28:05.619" style="s2">it was before he was encouraging this</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.159" end="01:28:07.150" style="s2">morality where it would be used more to</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.619" end="01:28:09.850" style="s2">keep in touch with people through more</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.150" end="01:28:12.580" style="s2">benign uses and Facebook itself has been</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.850" end="01:28:14.710" style="s2">more aggressive about fact-checking</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.580" end="01:28:17.739" style="s2">content policing content and actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.710" end="01:28:20.380" style="s2">pushing content out to people about this</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.739" end="01:28:22.210" style="s2">virus so it&#39;s maybe an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.380" end="01:28:23.980" style="s2">Facebook just like world war ii was an</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.210" end="01:28:24.610" style="s2">opportunity for the u.s. to get out of</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.980" end="01:28:27.400" style="s2">the depression</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.610" end="01:28:31.060" style="s2">maybe this crisis as a way for facebook</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.400" end="01:28:32.949" style="s2">to get past its reputational tailspin</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.060" end="01:28:36.490" style="s2">which nothing had had been able to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.949" end="01:28:39.010" style="s2">before this had had any effectiveness</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.490" end="01:28:40.900" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s let&#39;s hope so I will</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.010" end="01:28:43.660" style="s2">say I found and you know I&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.900" end="01:28:46.240" style="s2">a huge basher of Facebook even though I</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.660" end="01:28:48.640" style="s2">will say over the years my engagement</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.240" end="01:28:51.250" style="s2">with public Facebook or open facebook</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.640" end="01:28:53.770" style="s2">has declined and but I do find Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.250" end="01:28:55.150" style="s2">very useful in its groups right</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.770" end="01:28:57.280" style="s2">and during this Cove in nineteen</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.150" end="01:29:00.060" style="s2">pandemic some of the groups I&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.280" end="01:29:02.500" style="s2">member of I would say have done the best</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.060" end="01:29:04.510" style="s2">sense-making on what&#39;s really going on</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.500" end="01:29:06.640" style="s2">and what to expect of any place I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.510" end="01:29:09.040" style="s2">seen better than the professional media</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.640" end="01:29:11.350" style="s2">I know Zuckerberg and you mentioned it</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.040" end="01:29:15.340" style="s2">in the book does have great hopes for</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.350" end="01:29:16.810" style="s2">groups as a way to you know move move</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.340" end="01:29:18.430" style="s2">Facebook to the next level will be</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.810" end="01:29:21.610" style="s2">interesting to see if this Koba 19</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.430" end="01:29:23.470" style="s2">provides a catalyst for that you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.610" end="01:29:25.270" style="s2">you know Mark Zuckerberg would be very</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.470" end="01:29:27.460" style="s2">happy to hear you say that because as</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.270" end="01:29:30.850" style="s2">you mentioned you know he made a special</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.460" end="01:29:33.820" style="s2">focus the year after the election to</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.850" end="01:29:35.920" style="s2">tell these meaningful groups as he calls</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.820" end="01:29:37.900" style="s2">them you know the the groups that people</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.920" end="01:29:40.450" style="s2">join that give them valuable information</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.900" end="01:29:42.250" style="s2">or you know speak to important part of</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.450" end="01:29:44.080" style="s2">their identity you know could not point</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.250" end="01:29:46.180" style="s2">it like a hundred million people which</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.080" end="01:29:47.740" style="s2">is a like a blip in Facebook we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.180" end="01:29:49.240" style="s2">in those groups and he wanted a billion</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.740" end="01:29:51.640" style="s2">people to be on those those groups and</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.240" end="01:29:53.170" style="s2">maybe that number is rising considerably</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.640" end="01:29:56.260" style="s2">now yeah I would say 90 percent</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.170" end="01:29:58.840" style="s2">literally 90% of my usage of Facebook is</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.260" end="01:30:00.940" style="s2">in you know a handful maybe a dozen</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.840" end="01:30:02.620" style="s2">groups that I belong to and the quality</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.940" end="01:30:04.780" style="s2">of this course for a well moderated</p>
