<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.110" style="s2">I think most people probably do this the</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.890" end="00:00:06.330" style="s2">opposite and do their live video after</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.110" end="00:00:08.490" style="s2">they practice like hey let&#39;s pop on</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:11.969" style="s2">YouTube do a practice run before I</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.490" end="00:00:13.620" style="s2">record it from the Facebook group I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">already done it a few times and then I</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.620" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">put my whiteboard actually up on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">wall instead of sideways for six years</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">here I thought that the saving the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:26.310" style="s2">did require two rules in mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">all right so many people how many people</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.310" end="00:00:45.390" style="s2">save the world cuz normally I draw</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">perfect circles perfect as you will see</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.390" end="00:01:02.510" style="s2">on the next ones members so million</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">members paying $10 a month each and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.510" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">committing to one hour on our social</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">media so they can keep up to date both</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">like as easy is going on Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.460" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">liking friends posts that&#39;s the hour you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">have to commit an hour per month in</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">order to stay an active member we did in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">that million so that gives us 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">dollars a month to save the world but we</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">then have I&#39;m doing this and just as</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">like 10% 10% just because it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">easy math and I think it&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">word doable like if only 10% of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">people do this 10 percent of the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">do that I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">overarching thing so 10 percent will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">to keep doing this the wrong course so</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">these people will let&#39;s say do</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.260" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">and there&#39;s a hundred thousand so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.500" end="00:02:07.810" style="s2">is either they just spend ten hours</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:09.640" style="s2">online finding out what which is again</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.810" end="00:02:11.350" style="s2">only two and a half hours per week we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.640" end="00:02:13.930" style="s2">all pretty much do that more than that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.350" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">on Facebook I think just regularly but</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.930" end="00:02:16.870" style="s2">hundreds people the idea is that ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:19.450" style="s2">hours a week is more concentrated but</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.870" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">everyone&#39;s only doing what they want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.450" end="00:02:23.950" style="s2">do so it&#39;s it&#39;s just like one Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:25.810" style="s2">right we&#39;re not working or just having</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.950" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2">fun about doing what we want to do and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.810" end="00:02:29.380" style="s2">then all of a sudden we&#39;ve wasted 10</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.100" end="00:02:30.940" style="s2">hours in that same way but like we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.380" end="00:02:32.140" style="s2">still book calls out for things that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.940" end="00:02:34.030" style="s2">actually need to get done and the people</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.140" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">who want to volunteer for that can do it</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.030" end="00:02:39.730" style="s2">these few inner circles or not maybe so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:43.900" style="s2">I just like doing 10% and 10% so then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.730" end="00:02:49.390" style="s2">have 10,000 people who put in say 20</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.900" end="00:02:50.860" style="s2">hours per month and again doing things</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.390" end="00:02:53.770" style="s2">that they they want to be doing so it</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.860" end="00:02:56.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like work to them again</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.770" end="00:03:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s 20 hours per month is still only 5</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.500" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">hours per week then you have 1,000</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.520" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">people for 40 hours like again these are</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:15.670" style="s2">rough estimates and things where like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:16.900" style="s2">think that more like we have a million</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.670" end="00:03:18.760" style="s2">people sign out there&#39;s gonna be more</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.900" end="00:03:20.470" style="s2">than a hundred thousand who want to put</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.760" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">in ten hours it&#39;s gonna be but this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.470" end="00:03:26.860" style="s2">under estimating not to show that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.150" style="s2">so thousand people that&#39;s one in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.860" end="00:03:29.500" style="s2">thousand because a thousand or two</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.150" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">thousand one in a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.500" end="00:03:35.140" style="s2">putting in 40 hours per month doing 10</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:36.940" style="s2">hours it&#39;s just like what naturally this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.140" end="00:03:38.650" style="s2">is how we naturally fall right but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.940" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">don&#39;t oh it&#39;s better spent central</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.650" end="00:03:44.650" style="s2">circles before I get on to the next part</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:48.070" style="s2">so then you have 100 people who are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.650" end="00:03:50.200" style="s2">employees these people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.070" end="00:03:51.430" style="s2">necessarily doing hopefully as much as</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.200" end="00:03:53.050" style="s2">possible they&#39;re doing what&#39;s easy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.430" end="00:03:55.510" style="s2">lightly fun for them but they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.050" end="00:03:57.070" style="s2">paid so now we have to ask them to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.510" end="00:03:59.170" style="s2">maybe a bit above and beyond what</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.070" end="00:04:00.670" style="s2">they&#39;re just gonna naturally do because</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.170" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">we&#39;re paying them or distressing their</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.670" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:05.650" style="s2">with money so that they can put their</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:06.760" style="s2">time and expertise in severance maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.650" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">this thousand hours</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.760" end="00:04:11.230" style="s2">some people who they&#39;re pretty forty</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.849" style="s2">hours per month they possibly also be</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.230" end="00:04:14.980" style="s2">getting paid or getting more perks or</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.849" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">getting more like you don&#39;t get to just</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.980" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">choose that you&#39;re an employee any more</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:19.989" style="s2">than you but like you&#39;re invited to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:21.910" style="s2">the one in a million and then you get to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.989" end="00:04:23.530" style="s2">choose how much work you do right if</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.910" end="00:04:25.060" style="s2">you&#39;re you don&#39;t get to be an employee</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.530" end="00:04:26.680" style="s2">unless you&#39;re one of those thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.060" end="00:04:30.190" style="s2">right unless you&#39;re someone who puts in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.680" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">48 hours a month volunteering for free</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.190" end="00:04:33.910" style="s2">showing that you&#39;re the kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.740" style="s2">who wants to be here and wants to find</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.910" end="00:04:41.260" style="s2">you&#39;re not probably get to be an</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.740" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">employee also where people are more of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.260" end="00:04:47.139" style="s2">an expert like it would take me a week</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.310" style="s2">of solid time to do a task and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.139" end="00:04:49.570" style="s2">yeah okay I&#39;ll do it but only if I get</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.310" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">paid for it let someone else I&#39;d be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.570" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">to you know spend three hours doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.690" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">employees then we have the board of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.070" end="00:05:09.960" style="s2">directors which are ten people and those</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:09.960" style="s2">board of directors every year we have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">ATD tension Board of Directors</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.490" end="00:05:22.270" style="s2">determined by a snapshot of democracy so</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:25.090" style="s2">let&#39;s say June 1st every year</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.270" end="00:05:27.370" style="s2">whoever you delegate your vote to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.090" end="00:05:28.780" style="s2">top ten people who have the most votes</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.370" end="00:05:31.720" style="s2">delegated to them become the board of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.780" end="00:05:33.430" style="s2">directors for the next year but we get</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.720" end="00:05:36.490" style="s2">to choose which one of those Board of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.430" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">Directors has our delegated boat so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.490" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">they can sit at the table and represent</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:40.900" style="s2">us we can also hold on once the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:43.750" style="s2">technology is in place it can also hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.900" end="00:05:46.419" style="s2">on to our boat because everybody all</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.750" end="00:05:48.220" style="s2">million members have access to the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.419" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">information once we have the technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.220" end="00:05:54.570" style="s2">to do that so the board of directors</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:56.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have this internal information</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.570" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">that everyone doesn&#39;t have access to and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.770" end="00:05:59.139" style="s2">then they have to you have to trust that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:00.580" style="s2">they&#39;re working in our best interests</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.139" end="00:06:01.810" style="s2">cuz we can see whether or not they work</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.580" end="00:06:04.780" style="s2">in their best interest cuz they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.810" end="00:06:06.370" style="s2">saying hey I voted this way because of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.780" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">all of this evidence that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.370" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">provided right because you guys said</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:12.700" style="s2">this is the way you should vote so</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:14.910" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s and everyone&#39;s in the one</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.700" end="00:06:21.040" style="s2">is are there a million people out there</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.910" end="00:06:23.950" style="s2">who would pay $10 a month and co-create</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.040" end="00:06:25.210" style="s2">with another the other nine hundred nine</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.950" end="00:06:26.650" style="s2">hundred and ninety nine thousand nine</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.210" end="00:06:28.870" style="s2">hundred ninety nine people that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.650" end="00:06:30.580" style="s2">that is right like who wants to go great</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.870" end="00:06:35.800" style="s2">yes I think that it&#39;s the question is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.580" end="00:06:38.500" style="s2">how big of a pool do we need this to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.800" end="00:06:40.480" style="s2">to the find are 1 billion people is it 1</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.500" end="00:06:42.580" style="s2">in 10 people that is an uber cooperator</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.480" end="00:06:44.500" style="s2">and what would want to do this is it one</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.580" end="00:06:45.730" style="s2">in a thousand twenty two million it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.500" end="00:06:47.800" style="s2">one in a million we&#39;re screwed because</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.730" end="00:06:50.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a million a million people</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.800" end="00:06:52.480" style="s2">on this planet if it&#39;s one in ten people</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.350" end="00:06:55.330" style="s2">or one in a hundred people and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.480" end="00:06:57.700" style="s2">needs to go to one not this video but</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.330" end="00:06:59.530" style="s2">the video that explains that a single</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.700" end="00:07:01.620" style="s2">spiral needs to go out to ten million</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.530" end="00:07:04.180" style="s2">people to get 1 million people signed on</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.620" end="00:07:05.530" style="s2">now the truth is you can start this with</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.180" end="00:07:07.180" style="s2">a lot less than 1 million people and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.530" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of starting here and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.180" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">here our way out</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:14.320" style="s2">but the reason 1 million is inspiring is</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">you then have 10 million dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.320" end="00:07:17.890" style="s2">to work with and a lot of what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.590" style="s2">is this threshold business where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.890" end="00:07:22.510" style="s2">like okay pop with an idea for a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.590" end="00:07:24.070" style="s2">business a new system a new product</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.510" end="00:07:25.630" style="s2">anything you don&#39;t know if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.070" end="00:07:27.880" style="s2">enough people out there who need it who</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.630" end="00:07:30.580" style="s2">you&#39;re solving the problem for until</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.880" end="00:07:32.020" style="s2">you&#39;ve created it and then the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.580" end="00:07:35.320" style="s2">yes if you do market research but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.020" end="00:07:37.570" style="s2">still not as good as crowdfunding or do</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.320" end="00:07:39.100" style="s2">people actually sign up before you ever</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.570" end="00:07:40.810" style="s2">started right and you&#39;re like no no</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.100" end="00:07:42.040" style="s2">here&#39;s my prototype how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.810" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">there Oh a hundred thousand people want</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.040" end="00:07:45.370" style="s2">them and this is the price point we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:46.810" style="s2">sell it out right like that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.370" end="00:07:48.940" style="s2">set up a cars running campaign is you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.810" end="00:07:50.020" style="s2">realize what&#39;s that lowest threshold and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.940" end="00:07:51.220" style="s2">then if it goes beyond that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.020" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">making even more profit because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.220" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2">not actually lowering emails the big</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:08:00.070" style="s2">thing is is and it&#39;s not colder ship but</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.520" end="00:08:01.930" style="s2">in this way we&#39;re saying we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.070" end="00:08:03.670" style="s2">million people who have signed on who</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.930" end="00:08:05.080" style="s2">say yes we&#39;re willing to pay attendance</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.670" end="00:08:06.520" style="s2">per month you&#39;re not paying $10 per</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.080" end="00:08:09.640" style="s2">month yeah that&#39;s only happens at a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.520" end="00:08:11.410" style="s2">specific point in the process but that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.640" end="00:08:13.750" style="s2">they&#39;re agreeing to means we have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.410" end="00:08:17.050" style="s2">threshold to change worlds we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.750" end="00:08:21.430" style="s2">threshold of financial backing as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.050" end="00:08:23.400" style="s2">as 1 million people putting input input</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.430" end="00:08:24.780" style="s2">on any product we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.400" end="00:08:27.060" style="s2">once the technology is in place to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.780" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">that can&#39;t have and that&#39;s the issue -</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.060" end="00:08:31.530" style="s2">so the technology&#39;s not in place we</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:33.180" style="s2">can&#39;t have a conversation with 1 million</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.530" end="00:08:35.969" style="s2">people so let&#39;s say we did a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.180" end="00:08:37.529" style="s2">crowdfunding campaign overnight and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.969" end="00:08:39.089" style="s2">happened like it just happens and we got</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.529" end="00:08:42.060" style="s2">1 million people are willing to pay $10</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.089" end="00:08:44.580" style="s2">in the beginning it&#39;s just $10 for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.060" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">first section and the next project $10</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.580" end="00:08:49.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s not $10 per month $10 per</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:51.210" style="s2">project until we unlock simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">projects we have the threshold of users</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.210" end="00:08:55.890" style="s2">where that becomes like there are more</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:58.290" style="s2">hands and minds working on it then we</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.890" end="00:08:59.820" style="s2">can support then oh look now there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.290" end="00:09:02.339" style="s2">projects three projects right once we</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.820" end="00:09:03.510" style="s2">unlock simultaneous projects that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.339" end="00:09:04.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like just ten dollars per month</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.510" end="00:09:06.750" style="s2">instead of ten dollars for budgeting so</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.830" end="00:09:08.790" style="s2">people are signing up to pay ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.750" end="00:09:10.529" style="s2">per month to say yes when we get to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.790" end="00:09:12.600" style="s2">point that excites me that&#39;s what I want</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.529" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">to do I want to be giving ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.600" end="00:09:16.110" style="s2">these aren&#39;t people we have to convince</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:17.160" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna convince everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.110" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">because they&#39;re gonna be like okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.160" end="00:09:21.750" style="s2">Amanda knows about but this is awesome</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:23.459" style="s2">this isn&#39;t this is an actual hope and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.750" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">future and so that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.459" end="00:09:26.279" style="s2">one-million becomes the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:29.100" style="s2">like once we have a million people</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.279" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">signed up but then how do you ever have</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.100" end="00:09:33.690" style="s2">democracy and transparency with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">million people and the truth is in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.690" end="00:09:36.690" style="s2">beginning we&#39;re kind of gonna suck at it</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.060" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where you have the board</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.690" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">of directors we need a beta system so</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.060" end="00:09:42.690" style="s2">people can give their vote to one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">those Board of Directors and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.690" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">transparent like what we pick 10 random</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:49.320" style="s2">people to be on the board of directors</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:53.880" style="s2">but your vote can go in between those 10</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.320" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">people then like the best of them is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.880" end="00:09:59.490" style="s2">going to end up getting the most votes</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:03.450" style="s2">and they&#39;ll have the power to choose the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.490" end="00:10:07.170" style="s2">course of the what can be done with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.450" end="00:10:12.060" style="s2">employees is what can be done with tech</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.170" end="00:10:14.070" style="s2">earlier sorry what can be done with tech</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.060" end="00:10:15.810" style="s2">later it&#39;s done with employees on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.070" end="00:10:18.390" style="s2">backend first right so it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.810" end="00:10:20.220" style="s2">there if we don&#39;t have this the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.390" end="00:10:22.020" style="s2">technology in place to do to delegate</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.220" end="00:10:25.080" style="s2">votes yet and we want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.020" end="00:10:26.940" style="s2">transparent but anonymous so I know who</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.080" end="00:10:28.050" style="s2">I&#39;m delegated by a vote to that person</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.940" end="00:10:29.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually know it&#39;s my vote that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.050" end="00:10:32.220" style="s2">they have right so they can&#39;t like play</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.790" end="00:10:34.780" style="s2">gauges to me they have to know that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.220" end="00:10:36.850" style="s2">have 10,000 votes that they&#39;re from us</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.780" end="00:10:37.930" style="s2">but not who those 10,000 are and so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.850" end="00:10:39.880" style="s2">order to be able to do that maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.930" end="00:10:41.380" style="s2">have a back-end or people just what a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.880" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">million people that seems ridiculous 1</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.380" end="00:10:44.910" style="s2">million people that you like you get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:47.620" style="s2">go on and change your boat right but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.910" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">we probably need technology for that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.620" end="00:10:50.080" style="s2">the employees have to create it because</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:51.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t can&#39;t imagine we&#39;re gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.080" end="00:10:53.500" style="s2">million people sign in but or a million</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.820" end="00:10:56.860" style="s2">people to have information on what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.500" end="00:10:59.950" style="s2">board of directors is doing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.860" end="00:11:02.350" style="s2">have like a reporting system</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.950" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">we need people to record video we need</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.350" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">people to make that accessible if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:06.850" style="s2">just recording let&#39;s say we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:08.830" style="s2">session for six hours we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.850" end="00:11:12.670" style="s2">watch six hours video someone to take</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.830" end="00:11:14.470" style="s2">notes and distill the information down</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.670" end="00:11:16.090" style="s2">to be able to give it to people like hey</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.470" end="00:11:18.100" style="s2">here&#39;s what your delegate voted for</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.090" end="00:11:19.870" style="s2">here&#39;s why they say they voted that way</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.100" end="00:11:21.910" style="s2">right and that can be something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.870" end="00:11:23.290" style="s2">employees make easier for the board of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.910" end="00:11:25.060" style="s2">directors who might not be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.290" end="00:11:28.930" style="s2">that themselves I&#39;d be able to see that</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.060" end="00:11:30.580" style="s2">myself who did who did I can&#39;t say who i</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.930" end="00:11:32.260" style="s2">voted for but like only if it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.580" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">right if i had to write that up every</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.260" end="00:11:41.170" style="s2">time and then explain it i would not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:42.610" style="s2">the best of that once you can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.170" end="00:11:44.710" style="s2">how to make it work not have zero</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.610" end="00:11:47.170" style="s2">conflict nothing but like less chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.710" end="00:11:48.970" style="s2">and messy with 1 billion people you then</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.170" end="00:11:51.280" style="s2">open it up so that those 1 million</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.970" end="00:11:52.630" style="s2">people and you can set like if it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.280" end="00:11:54.070" style="s2">to have a conversation with a million i</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.630" end="00:11:56.020" style="s2">don&#39;t think if we upped it to 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.070" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be 10 times harder it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.020" end="00:11:59.980" style="s2">be maybe like twice as hard and even</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:02.170" style="s2">that is probably not the case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.980" end="00:12:05.110" style="s2">probably like 8 percent more hard like</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.170" end="00:12:06.520" style="s2">10 times population it&#39;s hard to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.110" end="00:12:08.350" style="s2">conversation with a million so having</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.520" end="00:12:11.830" style="s2">conversation 10 million is actually have</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.350" end="00:12:13.510" style="s2">much more difficult yeah so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.830" end="00:12:15.280" style="s2">the other beautiful thing so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.510" end="00:12:16.780" style="s2">starting with 10 million dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.280" end="00:12:18.250" style="s2">we&#39;re not starting but like one channel</p>
