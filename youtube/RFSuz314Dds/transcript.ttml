<p begin="00:01:59.180" end="00:02:05.549" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s do a bit of review oh I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">have one significant announcements this</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.549" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">is very important many of you know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:11.790" style="s2">my techno mage who runs the technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:13.709" style="s2">for me during all this</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.790" end="00:02:17.849" style="s2">and tomorrow and it is his most glorious</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.709" end="00:02:19.459" style="s2">birthday today so happy birthday - happy</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.849" end="00:02:25.379" style="s2">birthday tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.459" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">so last time we talked about the way in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.379" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">which we practice the five factors of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">acquiring mindfulness and that is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:38.280" style="s2">befriend our distractions to turn them</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:42.209" style="s2">into an arena in which we can learn much</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.280" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">much more so if the distractions go from</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.209" end="00:02:46.650" style="s2">being what what the name implies</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">something that distracts us to something</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.650" end="00:02:52.709" style="s2">that actually gives us a property for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:54.599" style="s2">practicing the five factors and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.709" end="00:02:56.370" style="s2">learning a lot more about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.599" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">because our distractions tend to reveal</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.370" end="00:03:04.019" style="s2">some of our mostly deeply ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:06.419" style="s2">habits of mind and identity so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.019" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">first of all review the factors and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.419" end="00:03:11.370" style="s2">order in which we make use of them the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:13.109" style="s2">core factor is vigilance and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.370" end="00:03:14.939" style="s2">practice that with meditative questing</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.109" end="00:03:17.579" style="s2">which you may will still want to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.939" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">maybe once a week okay meditative</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.579" end="00:03:22.590" style="s2">crusting that&#39;s the humility of attitude</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:25.319" style="s2">that exploratory observation that trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.590" end="00:03:27.479" style="s2">to get below the familiar face of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.319" end="00:03:31.229" style="s2">experience to have the insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.479" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">depths of the past enough so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.229" end="00:03:35.879" style="s2">distraction either physical or emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:37.829" style="s2">or mental you first label the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.879" end="00:03:41.159" style="s2">distraction as always and then you would</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.829" end="00:03:42.569" style="s2">apply vigilance to it then sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.159" end="00:03:44.519" style="s2">sensitivity you&#39;ve already been</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.569" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">cultivating a bit already when you were</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.519" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">learning how to route you turn all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:50.940" style="s2">the nouns of your experiences all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">snapshots into a flowing movie so for</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.940" end="00:03:53.699" style="s2">example in my distraction was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">physical destruction of pain it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.699" end="00:03:59.400" style="s2">pain its paining and it&#39;s an unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">process that keeps having novelty in it</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.400" end="00:04:04.470" style="s2">and emergent properties and features and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:06.409" style="s2">patterns okay so sensitivities I let it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.470" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">flow and I flow with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.409" end="00:04:11.459" style="s2">acuity acuity it&#39;s like remember visual</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:13.979" style="s2">acuity I try to give the analogy I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">want to everything confuse together I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.979" end="00:04:17.820" style="s2">want to pull apart and you learn this of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:20.430" style="s2">course with finding your flow I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.820" end="00:04:22.979" style="s2">pull apart all the different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.430" end="00:04:24.030" style="s2">sensations that I&#39;m getting so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.979" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">calling</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.030" end="00:04:27.720" style="s2">when I let it flow I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.550" style="s2">there&#39;s tension sensations and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.720" end="00:04:31.410" style="s2">heating sensations and there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.550" end="00:04:33.210" style="s2">that mysterious felt yuckiness at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.410" end="00:04:35.450" style="s2">core of it and there&#39;s a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.210" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">things going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.450" end="00:04:42.630" style="s2">next is noticing I try to notice the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:44.460" style="s2">three the three aspects of reaction my</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.630" end="00:04:47.400" style="s2">physical reaction what&#39;s my lived body</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.460" end="00:04:50.220" style="s2">doing with respect to the pain what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.400" end="00:04:52.470" style="s2">one of my emotions doing with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.220" end="00:04:53.970" style="s2">the pain what is my mind doing not so</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.470" end="00:04:55.560" style="s2">much what was my mind thinking but how</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.970" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">is it moving how was it sleeping itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.560" end="00:04:59.640" style="s2">with its temperature</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:01.380" style="s2">what&#39;s its temper so right you do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.640" end="00:05:02.820" style="s2">with you do that with physical</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.380" end="00:05:05.340" style="s2">distractions as I mentioned with</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.820" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">emotional distractions with mental</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.340" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">distractions I recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:11.790" style="s2">right with something like thinking you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:14.060" style="s2">try and pay attention to properties of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.790" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">the voice there might be multiple voices</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.060" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">right then none of them might be yours</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:21.990" style="s2">one of them might be yours etc or if</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:23.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a scene you try to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.990" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">that what&#39;s called mental paint that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.700" end="00:05:29.820" style="s2">firm term from phosphoryl their block</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.870" end="00:05:31.800" style="s2">you know is if you were looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.820" end="00:05:33.690" style="s2">scene as if it was a painting as if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.800" end="00:05:34.919" style="s2">put step back and looked at painting and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.690" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">you weren&#39;t looking at it what it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.919" end="00:05:38.850" style="s2">what it was a painting of but what</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">materials the artists have used to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.850" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">it for all three of these distractions</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:47.100" style="s2">we have three principles of practice if</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:49.080" style="s2">you go away if you&#39;re distracted from</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.100" end="00:05:51.000" style="s2">your destruction by a distraction you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.080" end="00:05:53.460" style="s2">forget the whole inquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.000" end="00:05:55.950" style="s2">exercise and then you return to your</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.460" end="00:05:59.490" style="s2">breath I need to go back to basic for</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.950" end="00:06:00.930" style="s2">plasma what they submit obvious all we</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.490" end="00:06:03.060" style="s2">just go back when you go back to medical</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.930" end="00:06:07.140" style="s2">doctor for passing the first okay if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.060" end="00:06:10.979" style="s2">go away if it goes away all right then</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.140" end="00:06:12.830" style="s2">you return to your breath pay very</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.979" end="00:06:16.289" style="s2">careful attention to your attitude</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.830" end="00:06:19.169" style="s2">because there&#39;s a temptation to try and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.289" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">turn this into a magical practice if</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.169" end="00:06:22.229" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:25.950" style="s2">meditate on thinking and the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.229" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">goes way pay attention to what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.950" end="00:06:31.650" style="s2">tastes like what does that feel like in</p>
