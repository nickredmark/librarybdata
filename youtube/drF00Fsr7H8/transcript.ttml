<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">great at one level we are discovering</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">the most amazing set of Patriots these</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">are people who are frightened about</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">where we&#39;re headed people who love their</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">country and are ready to sacrifice for</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">it and they are showing up to offer all</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">kinds of help skills that we definitely</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:20.280" style="s2">so things are rapidly in motion as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:22.770" style="s2">have mentioned before there is a curious</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.280" end="00:02:24.510" style="s2">lack the people who tell us that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.770" end="00:02:26.580" style="s2">are very much on board with the plan do</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.510" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">not always do anything that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.580" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">count them so that we can say how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.820" style="s2">people are actually rooting for us and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:35.340" style="s2">wanted to talk a little bit about why I</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.820" end="00:02:37.860" style="s2">think that might be so before you talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.340" end="00:02:39.750" style="s2">about why you think there&#39;s a failure</p>

<p begin="00:04:05.720" end="00:04:10.860" style="s2">here&#39;s the model that I came up with as</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.610" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">I was driving back from dropping Zach at</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.860" end="00:04:17.580" style="s2">his bicycle maintenance course that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">is taking what I realized was that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.580" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">are hearing pushback from a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">quadrants and one of those quadrants are</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:30.100" style="s2">people who say things to us like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:33.740" style="s2">like a great plan how about waiting till</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.100" end="00:04:35.330" style="s2">2024 when we&#39;ve already allowed Joe</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.330" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">White House etcetra etcetra could you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.740" end="00:04:39.920" style="s2">please just shelve this plan seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:41.330" style="s2">really cool but like I said that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.920" end="00:04:43.340" style="s2">like a great idea because it will give</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.330" end="00:04:45.410" style="s2">all of the enemies of the plan much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.340" end="00:04:46.760" style="s2">time to organize and get their</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.410" end="00:04:48.980" style="s2">together I hadn&#39;t even thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.760" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a great point here&#39;s the thing if</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.980" end="00:04:53.150" style="s2">you are somebody who has been alarmed</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:55.010" style="s2">about the corruption of our system and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.150" end="00:04:56.420" style="s2">the role that the duopoly plays in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.010" end="00:04:58.910" style="s2">corruption if you&#39;ve been aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.420" end="00:05:00.980" style="s2">for decades then you know that every</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.910" end="00:05:03.560" style="s2">single election cycle we go through this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.980" end="00:05:05.720" style="s2">right you say you know what this is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.560" end="00:05:08.390" style="s2">gonna solve itself the duopoly has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">lock on power and that lock on power is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.390" end="00:05:11.060" style="s2">being used to serve interests that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">not the interests of the American people</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.060" end="00:05:14.900" style="s2">what are we going to do about it if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.220" end="00:05:16.370" style="s2">say oh through the normal channels go</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.900" end="00:05:19.010" style="s2">ahead and go through the normal channels</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.370" end="00:05:21.110" style="s2">but if you say well we&#39;ve done that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.010" end="00:05:22.670" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work and you say maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:25.040" style="s2">have to do something else what happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.670" end="00:05:27.500" style="s2">next is people say ah if you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.040" end="00:05:29.210" style="s2">something else you will elect the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.500" end="00:05:30.890" style="s2">greater evil and this will be your fault</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.210" end="00:05:31.700" style="s2">right and nobody wants to be your fault</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.890" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.700" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen that happen to people like</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:37.610" style="s2">Ralph Nader 2020 is being set up to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.260" style="s2">explain the reelection of Trump right</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.610" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">when in fact we can squarely point at</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.260" end="00:05:43.790" style="s2">the DNC well first of all the DNC is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">responsible for this in more ways than</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.790" end="00:05:46.520" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:49.040" style="s2">the RNC as well the duopoly has er</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.520" end="00:05:52.310" style="s2">played tag team with their little</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.040" end="00:05:54.470" style="s2">corruption racket and so in any case you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.310" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">will hear each election cycle you will</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.470" end="00:05:57.770" style="s2">hear you&#39;re going to elect the greater</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:00.290" style="s2">evil and this is going to be your fault</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.770" end="00:06:02.120" style="s2">and then if you persist you will be told</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.290" end="00:06:03.890" style="s2">well you can&#39;t do it this time because</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.120" end="00:06:06.620" style="s2">of the Supreme Court right this is just</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.890" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">every single every single election cycle</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.620" end="00:06:10.250" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing the Supreme Court always</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:12.530" style="s2">seems to be on the verge of retirement</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.250" end="00:06:15.200" style="s2">and collapse it&#39;s funny it&#39;s almost as</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.530" end="00:06:17.660" style="s2">if it&#39;s staffed by mortals who have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.200" end="00:06:19.100" style="s2">lifespan and ultimately end up retiring</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.660" end="00:06:20.540" style="s2">and need to be replaced so it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.100" end="00:06:22.010" style="s2">the time for something not to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.540" end="00:06:24.350" style="s2">that the makeup of the Supreme Court</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.010" end="00:06:25.790" style="s2">isn&#39;t critical but it&#39;s it&#39;s always sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.350" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2">of I don&#39;t know what was that the second</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.790" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">or the third rejoinder - it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.669" end="00:06:34.850" style="s2">now well let&#39;s put it this way the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:36.169" style="s2">that it is critical this time is not an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.850" end="00:06:37.940" style="s2">argument against something different</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.169" end="00:06:39.650" style="s2">because it only gets more critical over</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.940" end="00:06:40.940" style="s2">time so if you think it&#39;s critical now</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.650" end="00:06:41.350" style="s2">and that&#39;s a reason not to do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.940" end="00:06:42.730" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.350" end="00:06:44.140" style="s2">actually got it backwards now is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.730" end="00:06:45.880" style="s2">time we have to do it because next time</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.140" end="00:06:47.500" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be even more critical</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.880" end="00:06:50.170" style="s2">so people are suggesting going back in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.500" end="00:06:50.590" style="s2">time if they have a mechanism I&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.170" end="00:06:55.270" style="s2">ears</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.590" end="00:06:57.610" style="s2">but in any case here&#39;s the thing I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.270" end="00:06:59.230" style="s2">heard so many times that you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.610" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">because you&#39;ll elect a greater evil</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.230" end="00:07:03.940" style="s2">the whole structure of this plan is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:05.380" style="s2">built to address that concern right we</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.940" end="00:07:09.460" style="s2">don&#39;t have that problem because we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.380" end="00:07:13.750" style="s2">structurally built a mechanism that will</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.460" end="00:07:16.060" style="s2">not spoil the election so in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.750" end="00:07:18.640" style="s2">that fact we are getting this pushback</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.060" end="00:07:20.020" style="s2">from certain people who say lovely plan</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.640" end="00:07:23.050" style="s2">all ears</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.020" end="00:07:26.170" style="s2">do it in 2024 and we&#39;ll get we&#39;ll get on</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.050" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">board but not now because of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.170" end="00:07:29.650" style="s2">so I want to tell you about my model</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:33.580" style="s2">that I came up with as I was driving</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.650" end="00:07:35.950" style="s2">back the model is this for many people</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.580" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">Donald Trump is the equivalent of a rock</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.950" end="00:07:39.220" style="s2">in your shoe right if you&#39;ve ever had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:41.590" style="s2">rock in your shoe and you&#39;ve all had</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.220" end="00:07:45.160" style="s2">rocks in our shoe right a rock in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.590" end="00:07:47.800" style="s2">shoe is top priority it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.160" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">ignore right every step it reminds you</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.800" end="00:07:51.460" style="s2">that this has to be dealt with and there</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:53.020" style="s2">are a lot of people who are experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.460" end="00:07:55.600" style="s2">Trump is the rock in their shoe that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.020" end="00:07:58.180" style="s2">needs to be dealt with but we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.600" end="00:08:00.070" style="s2">rock in our shoe at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.180" end="00:08:03.450" style="s2">we&#39;ve got basically the equivalent of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.070" end="00:08:06.430" style="s2">famine right we have a duopoly that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.450" end="00:08:08.200" style="s2">concentrated its power and built a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.430" end="00:08:11.500" style="s2">system that you can never escape and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.200" end="00:08:13.270" style="s2">has essentially denied people access to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.500" end="00:08:15.670" style="s2">the policy mechanisms that are supposed</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.270" end="00:08:18.220" style="s2">to serve their needs and this has gone</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.670" end="00:08:21.100" style="s2">on for decades and because of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.220" end="00:08:22.600" style="s2">people are not only frozen out of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.100" end="00:08:25.030" style="s2">well-being that they produce through</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.600" end="00:08:26.830" style="s2">their labor but they are also aware of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.030" end="00:08:28.360" style="s2">it and they&#39;re sick of it they know that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.830" end="00:08:30.790" style="s2">the system is rigged they may not know</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.360" end="00:08:33.370" style="s2">exactly in what way it is rigged but</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.790" end="00:08:36.820" style="s2">they&#39;re angry and here&#39;s the important</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.370" end="00:08:39.310" style="s2">point whether or not the rock in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.820" end="00:08:43.060" style="s2">shoe is the one thing you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.310" end="00:08:45.100" style="s2">or it&#39;s one on a set of high priorities</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.060" end="00:08:47.050" style="s2">that all have to be addressed has to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.100" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">in some sense with how threatened by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.050" end="00:08:52.780" style="s2">famine you are if you&#39;re especially well</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:54.460" style="s2">positioned in society then from your</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.780" end="00:08:55.250" style="s2">perspective it may well make sense we</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.460" end="00:08:56.450" style="s2">have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.250" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">rocking our shoe because even in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.450" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">famine you wouldn&#39;t want to leave a rock</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.970" style="s2">in your shoe because you whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.320" style="s2">gonna do to deal with the famine getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.970" end="00:09:05.030" style="s2">the rock out of your shoe first makes</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">sense so if you&#39;re not directly</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.030" end="00:09:08.660" style="s2">threatened by the famine then you will</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.430" end="00:09:10.070" style="s2">think Rock and your shoe is the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.660" end="00:09:11.930" style="s2">thing we got and you&#39;ll say stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.070" end="00:09:13.490" style="s2">well why don&#39;t you wait till 2024</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.930" end="00:09:15.110" style="s2">right let&#39;s deal with the rock and our</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.490" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">shoe and then 2024 we can deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.110" end="00:09:18.170" style="s2">famine but for anybody who&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.150" style="s2">starving or threatened with starvation</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.170" end="00:09:21.650" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make any sense because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.150" end="00:09:23.480" style="s2">rock and the shoe is a high priority and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.650" end="00:09:24.830" style="s2">the famine is a high priority and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:26.180" style="s2">gonna have to do something to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.830" end="00:09:28.130" style="s2">both of them maybe we got to get the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.180" end="00:09:30.050" style="s2">rock out but we&#39;ve also got to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.130" end="00:09:31.910" style="s2">the famine and here&#39;s an election in</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.050" end="00:09:33.590" style="s2">which you could do both could I read to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.910" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">you a couple of sentences from an</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.590" end="00:09:38.330" style="s2">excellent document that I found from</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:41.690" style="s2">almost ten years ago please do recent</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.330" end="00:09:43.520" style="s2">decades this is from 2011 recent decades</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.690" end="00:09:44.780" style="s2">have witnessed a de facto coup against</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.780" end="00:09:48.020" style="s2">and the wholesale capture and sabotage</p>

<p begin="00:10:01.070" end="00:10:05.180" style="s2">is from the declaration of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.150" end="00:10:08.150" style="s2">interdependence which you wrote during</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.180" end="00:10:10.339" style="s2">occupy and which proceeds to make a</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.520" end="00:10:24.200" style="s2">will presumably be no two evils to</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.200" end="00:10:29.210" style="s2">that I know that you had formalized in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.060" end="00:10:30.680" style="s2">writing some of exactly the concerns</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.210" end="00:10:32.390" style="s2">that you have laid out in the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.680" end="00:10:35.870" style="s2">whatever five minutes of this livestream</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.390" end="00:10:37.070" style="s2">today this is from 2011 that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.870" end="00:10:39.380" style="s2">thank you you know I have thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.070" end="00:10:41.270" style="s2">frequently during this unity 2020 phase</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.380" end="00:10:43.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought about that document and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.270" end="00:10:45.560" style="s2">just literally have not had the time to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.100" end="00:10:48.020" style="s2">go find it but yeah I wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.560" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">declaration of interdependence and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.020" end="00:10:52.550" style="s2">it lays out exactly the problem and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:55.400" style="s2">that tells you is that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.550" end="00:10:58.490" style="s2">that bit that you read there is equally</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.400" end="00:11:00.080" style="s2">applicable today that tells you some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.490" end="00:11:01.700" style="s2">us have been aware of this for quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.080" end="00:11:03.320" style="s2">some time and we&#39;ve tried to call</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.700" end="00:11:05.240" style="s2">people&#39;s attention to it and what people</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.320" end="00:11:06.950" style="s2">have been is to calm to address it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.240" end="00:11:08.660" style="s2">and yeah let me say that you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.950" end="00:11:10.550" style="s2">as as we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.660" end="00:11:12.980" style="s2">making clear throughout you know had</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.550" end="00:11:16.220" style="s2">been anyway still are lifelong Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.980" end="00:11:17.810" style="s2">liberals progressives you know much to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.220" end="00:11:21.379" style="s2">the irritation of some in our audience</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.810" end="00:11:24.139" style="s2">but this was written in 2011 this was</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.379" end="00:11:27.410" style="s2">written during Obama&#39;s first term we we</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.139" end="00:11:29.089" style="s2">were so hopeful about Obama in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.410" end="00:11:31.610" style="s2">beginning and that does not mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.089" end="00:11:33.560" style="s2">did not critique during his his first</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.610" end="00:11:35.029" style="s2">and certainly his second term what it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.560" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">was that was actually being accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.029" end="00:11:40.310" style="s2">after that great rhetorical movement</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:41.720" style="s2">that actually got him elected and it was</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.720" end="00:11:44.689" style="s2">a rhetoric it was a rhetorical with me</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.370" end="00:11:46.550" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely right about that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.689" end="00:11:48.110" style="s2">you know I still like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.550" end="00:11:50.300" style="s2">rhetoric but the fact is he&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.110" end="00:11:52.189" style="s2">didn&#39;t translate into policy that serve</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.189" end="00:11:57.980" style="s2">the duopoly I mean let&#39;s face facts folk</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.910" end="00:11:59.420" style="s2">they they don&#39;t want to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.980" end="00:12:01.550" style="s2">problem not because they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.420" end="00:12:03.769" style="s2">ideally like to do it also but it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.550" end="00:12:06.019" style="s2">counterproductive from the point of view</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.769" end="00:12:09.199" style="s2">of the thing that they actually do which</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.019" end="00:12:11.870" style="s2">is deliver well-being to a small number</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.199" end="00:12:14.300" style="s2">of very powerful entities that have</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.870" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">bought access right it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.430" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t expect them we should expect</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.660" end="00:12:24.529" style="s2">them to deliver us rhetoric and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.430" end="00:12:26.420" style="s2">symbolism and false solutions until we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.529" end="00:12:29.389" style="s2">finally get wise to it and my point</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.420" end="00:12:30.949" style="s2">would be well maybe it&#39;s time we finally</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.389" end="00:12:34.430" style="s2">got wives to it I mean collectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.949" end="00:12:36.470" style="s2">enough that we can actually evict them</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.430" end="00:12:38.209" style="s2">from the positions from which they</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.470" end="00:12:40.550" style="s2">capture all of the well-being that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.209" end="00:12:43.880" style="s2">should be widely available and deliver</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.550" end="00:12:46.279" style="s2">it to their own yeah it&#39;s really uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.880" end="00:12:47.689" style="s2">quite a thing but if you are hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.279" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">same thing we are hearing if you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.689" end="00:12:52.519" style="s2">hearing people say well that&#39;s a cool</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:54.139" style="s2">plan how about we try that in 2024 think</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.519" end="00:12:55.970" style="s2">about whether or not the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.139" end="00:12:57.709" style="s2">telling you that are really telling you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.970" end="00:12:59.779" style="s2">that from their perspective the famine</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.709" end="00:13:01.490" style="s2">isn&#39;t such a big deal because on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.779" end="00:13:02.930" style="s2">whole the duopoly has probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.490" end="00:13:04.939" style="s2">inadvertently in most of their cases</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.930" end="00:13:07.819" style="s2">serve their interest just by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.939" end="00:13:09.740" style="s2">where in society they are and for people</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.819" end="00:13:11.480" style="s2">who are closer to the bottom of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.480" end="00:13:15.980" style="s2">of the ladder this has been critical for</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.069" end="00:13:18.579" style="s2">decades right the danger to to working</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.980" end="00:13:22.100" style="s2">people is so extreme that now we see</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.579" end="00:13:23.140" style="s2">quite predictable movements in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.100" end="00:13:26.410" style="s2">street of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.140" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">but frankly shouting incoherently to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.410" end="00:13:29.770" style="s2">tear the thing down because all they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">see is the harm that it does because</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.770" end="00:13:36.130" style="s2">that harm is concentrated where they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:37.810" style="s2">so that is all very important now I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.130" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">would point to the last thing here which</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.810" end="00:13:44.530" style="s2">is really the place that&#39;s harder that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">find hardest to make the point it has</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.530" end="00:13:49.000" style="s2">long been true that the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:51.220" style="s2">in particular has delivered symbolism in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.000" end="00:13:53.950" style="s2">lieu of actual well-being right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.220" end="00:13:56.740" style="s2">been their go-to strategy this party did</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.950" end="00:13:58.360" style="s2">you say is particularly prone to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.740" end="00:14:00.820" style="s2">well it&#39;s not that one party is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.360" end="00:14:02.680" style="s2">particularly prone to it it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.820" end="00:14:04.060" style="s2">Democratic Party has traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.680" end="00:14:06.970" style="s2">served the interests of working people</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.060" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">and so having shifted away from that now</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.970" end="00:14:11.860" style="s2">it has to deliver symbolism in lieu of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:14.050" style="s2">actual policy you know back as symbols</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.860" end="00:14:15.670" style="s2">are cheaper they are cheaper but in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.050" end="00:14:17.290" style="s2">case the symbols have begun to run out</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.670" end="00:14:18.640" style="s2">people aren&#39;t buying it anymore right we</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.290" end="00:14:21.340" style="s2">went through eight years of Obama and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.640" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">things did not get better so we know</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.340" end="00:14:24.340" style="s2">that the rhetoric doesn&#39;t add up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.530" style="s2">policy that actually serves people we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.340" end="00:14:28.900" style="s2">know that we still have you know a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.530" end="00:14:30.430" style="s2">system of medical care for example that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.900" end="00:14:32.050" style="s2">people can&#39;t access and that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.430" end="00:14:33.910" style="s2">dependent on their relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.050" end="00:14:35.230" style="s2">their employer and that the economic</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.910" end="00:14:36.520" style="s2">system is fragile in the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.230" end="00:14:38.050" style="s2">constructed and so you can lose your</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.520" end="00:14:42.010" style="s2">health care you know at the drop of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.050" end="00:14:43.840" style="s2">hat so what has changed is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.010" end="00:14:47.050" style="s2">Democratic Party seems to be toying with</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.840" end="00:14:48.820" style="s2">a mechanism to deliver many people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.050" end="00:14:52.150" style="s2">are stressed out by what I&#39;m calling the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.820" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">famine to deliver them something well</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.150" end="00:14:57.180" style="s2">the something that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:15:00.430" style="s2">deliver is well-being that currently is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.180" end="00:15:02.470" style="s2">held by other people who are in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.430" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">similar strata in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.470" end="00:15:06.520" style="s2">intersectional thing is about pointing</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:09.010" style="s2">people who are angry about having been</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.520" end="00:15:11.290" style="s2">frozen out redirecting them away from</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.010" end="00:15:12.700" style="s2">the places where well-being is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.290" end="00:15:14.200" style="s2">concentrated and pointing them at</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.700" end="00:15:17.140" style="s2">another group of citizens and this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.200" end="00:15:18.910" style="s2">the most deeply unpatriotic move you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.140" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">imagine pointing Americans at each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.910" end="00:15:22.540" style="s2">rather than dealing with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:26.500" style="s2">opportunity has concentrated at the top</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.540" end="00:15:30.340" style="s2">is just a pall to use the pie analogy</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.500" end="00:15:33.940" style="s2">the zero-sum nonzero-sum language that</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.340" end="00:15:36.380" style="s2">we have used it is possible that growth</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.940" end="00:15:38.300" style="s2">some growth in some sectors can contain</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.380" end="00:15:40.580" style="s2">you but even if we assume that we are in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.300" end="00:15:42.650" style="s2">zero-sum space at a national level with</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.580" end="00:15:43.850" style="s2">regard to well-being and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.650" end="00:15:45.860" style="s2">that that&#39;s true but even if we assume</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.850" end="00:15:48.550" style="s2">that what you are saying if I if I hear</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.860" end="00:15:51.110" style="s2">you correctly is there is some some pie</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.550" end="00:15:53.030" style="s2">for you no and this is going to be hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.110" end="00:15:55.160" style="s2">to operationalize but you know for well</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.030" end="00:15:57.530" style="s2">being which is you know to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.160" end="00:16:00.740" style="s2">that good proxies resources there for</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.530" end="00:16:03.980" style="s2">all of Americans and what you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.740" end="00:16:07.640" style="s2">pointing out is that the elite the 1%</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.980" end="00:16:10.700" style="s2">the people with power have observed that</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.640" end="00:16:12.440" style="s2">a number of people are seeing this you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.700" end="00:16:16.010" style="s2">know since occupy since before then</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.440" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">right and saying well if we can pit some</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.010" end="00:16:20.450" style="s2">of the kind of haves</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:23.720" style="s2">against the recognizing have-nots</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.450" end="00:16:26.450" style="s2">against each other we can redefine what</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.720" end="00:16:28.730" style="s2">the pie actually is to be that very tiny</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.450" end="00:16:30.410" style="s2">sliver of the actual pie while we keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.730" end="00:16:33.080" style="s2">all the rest of it so it&#39;s like a pie</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.410" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">within a pie and the people with most of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.080" end="00:16:38.090" style="s2">it are successfully redefining what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:40.940" style="s2">actual pie is and causing the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.090" end="00:16:44.090" style="s2">to fight amongst ourselves yeah so I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.940" end="00:16:46.280" style="s2">toying with the idea that Biden was to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.090" end="00:16:48.170" style="s2">let them eat cake candidate that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.280" end="00:16:52.790" style="s2">really the nature of Joe Biden at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.170" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">moment and you fixed that analogy</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.790" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">beautifully remember what you said not</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:17:00.350" style="s2">at the moment you said no he&#39;s to let</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:01.910" style="s2">them eat their cake candidate oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.350" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">because in this seat and let them eat</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.910" end="00:17:06.439" style="s2">cake there&#39;s no cake that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">the rent-seeking elites in the monarchy</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.439" end="00:17:09.709" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that there&#39;s no cake</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:11.510" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s an absurdly they</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.709" end="00:17:13.930" style="s2">have cake only they have cake so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.510" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">think cake is everywhere in this case</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.930" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">there is cake well there&#39;s an abundance</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:21.350" style="s2">of there&#39;s such an abundance of cheap</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:22.910" style="s2">goods that were exactly the things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.350" end="00:17:25.130" style="s2">were limiting until like a second ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.910" end="00:17:26.750" style="s2">historically speaking that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.130" end="00:17:28.430" style="s2">let them eat their cake cakes available</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.750" end="00:17:30.470" style="s2">right and so in this case instead of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.430" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">taking the you know and again we have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.470" end="00:17:34.430" style="s2">draw a distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:37.040" style="s2">productivity of elites which actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.430" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">serves everybody and the rent-seeking of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.040" end="00:17:40.430" style="s2">people who become powerful some of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">have gotten powerful through being</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.430" end="00:17:43.310" style="s2">highly productive and contributing</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:45.710" style="s2">things that matter but once they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.310" end="00:17:46.790" style="s2">productive it&#39;s very hard to resist they</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.710" end="00:17:48.590" style="s2">don&#39;t even necessarily know that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.790" end="00:17:50.049" style="s2">are engaged in Reds rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.590" end="00:17:52.149" style="s2">there are just opportunities that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.049" end="00:17:53.080" style="s2">and they do that which pays and many of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.149" end="00:17:57.369" style="s2">those opportunities are</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.080" end="00:18:00.460" style="s2">rent-seeking by definition so the DNC</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.369" end="00:18:02.830" style="s2">has decided to point us at each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.460" end="00:18:05.470" style="s2">and the basic point is well there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.830" end="00:18:07.149" style="s2">enough cake but if this group goes after</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.470" end="00:18:09.009" style="s2">the cake of that group then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.149" end="00:18:10.690" style="s2">rent-seeking elites can continue on for</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.009" end="00:18:14.200" style="s2">another four eight who knows how many</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.690" end="00:18:16.119" style="s2">election cycles or eight years the goods</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.200" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">analogy gets twisted but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.119" end="00:18:19.210" style="s2">cupcake within a pie</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:21.850" style="s2">well there are twisted baked goods not</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.210" end="00:18:24.759" style="s2">that many but some very you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.850" end="00:18:27.789" style="s2">delicious ones yeah yeah all right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.759" end="00:18:30.369" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s the developing model yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.789" end="00:18:32.379" style="s2">and here&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.369" end="00:18:35.080" style="s2">presumably if you&#39;re watching or</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.379" end="00:18:36.730" style="s2">listening to this podcast you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.080" end="00:18:38.889" style="s2">wise to this stuff you&#39;re aware of game</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.730" end="00:18:42.070" style="s2">theory you&#39;re aware of what rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.889" end="00:18:45.090" style="s2">is and why it&#39;s a hazard you&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.070" end="00:18:47.529" style="s2">the evolutionary forces that will take a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.090" end="00:18:49.119" style="s2">corrupt system and make it more corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.529" end="00:18:52.659" style="s2">because the loopholes will tend to self</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.119" end="00:18:54.279" style="s2">enlarge so if you can see it then isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.659" end="00:18:56.919" style="s2">this the moment wouldn&#39;t you like in</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.279" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">four months for us to have turned the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.919" end="00:19:00.789" style="s2">corner for something unexpected new and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:02.919" style="s2">potentially very desirable to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.789" end="00:19:05.230" style="s2">happened wouldn&#39;t you like adults at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.919" end="00:19:07.119" style="s2">helm I mean don&#39;t you have a right to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.230" end="00:19:08.379" style="s2">demand that as an American have adults</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.119" end="00:19:14.739" style="s2">at the helm don&#39;t we all</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.379" end="00:19:16.570" style="s2">so how about it fabulous all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.739" end="00:19:19.029" style="s2">know you have things on on your agenda</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.570" end="00:19:21.580" style="s2">for today yeah you know nothing as big</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.029" end="00:19:24.100" style="s2">but it all plays into part of why we</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.580" end="00:19:28.509" style="s2">need that we need big structural change</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.100" end="00:19:30.730" style="s2">right so maybe this is this is all kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.509" end="00:19:33.249" style="s2">of working by fire here or I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.730" end="00:19:35.409" style="s2">have us put something up on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.249" end="00:19:37.720" style="s2">if we can you didn&#39;t just suggest a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.409" end="00:19:42.220" style="s2">trial by fire did you I was about to and</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.669" end="00:19:57.519" style="s2">those of you listening in podcast space</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.200" end="00:20:00.039" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re gonna get a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.519" end="00:20:01.659" style="s2">this time okay so here&#39;s a guy</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.039" end="00:20:03.000" style="s2">Christopher Ruffo I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.659" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">how but he&#39;s written I really</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.000" end="00:20:08.490" style="s2">quite extraordinary thread Twitter on</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:09.870" style="s2">Twitter the first tweet of which reads</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.490" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">the City of Seattle held a training</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.870" end="00:20:13.320" style="s2">session for white employees called quote</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:15.570" style="s2">interrupting internalized racial</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.570" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">so why did a public records request he</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:20.310" style="s2">says to find it exactly what this means</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:23.580" style="s2">let&#39;s go through it together in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.310" end="00:20:25.560" style="s2">thread so it&#39;s it&#39;s worth looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.580" end="00:20:28.620" style="s2">it&#39;s all the same garbage I want us to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.560" end="00:20:30.540" style="s2">go through this little this first flyer</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.620" end="00:20:32.430" style="s2">that he talks about and then I also want</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.540" end="00:20:34.440" style="s2">to talk about since I went to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.430" end="00:20:36.750" style="s2">excruciating exercise last week of</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.330" end="00:20:44.220" style="s2">are being forced to read it as if it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:49.040" style="s2">an actually anti-racist argument when in</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.220" end="00:20:51.570" style="s2">fact it&#39;s it&#39;s quite not so first this</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.040" end="00:20:52.590" style="s2">again the City of Seattle which you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.570" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">the whole Pacific Northwest</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.590" end="00:20:58.110" style="s2">unfortunately which we live in and love</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:21:02.930" style="s2">it but this is a bit of a hotbed of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.110" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">kind of thinking suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.930" end="00:21:09.860" style="s2">internalized racial superiority reveals</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:12.540" style="s2">itself in values such as individualism</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.070" end="00:21:21.660" style="s2">this is the sort of thing we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.660" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">over and over again it is basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.660" end="00:21:28.010" style="s2">equating Enlightenment values and</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.090" end="00:22:11.010" style="s2">about division this movement is about</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.430" end="00:22:12.330" style="s2">separating us and unfortunately what it</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.010" end="00:22:14.940" style="s2">feels like so we were just talking in</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.330" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">terms of music at the DNC the power</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.530" end="00:22:37.880" style="s2">here&#39;s part of how that works that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.520" style="s2">are embracing this incredibly divisive</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.880" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">movement that goes by many different</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.380" end="00:23:02.330" style="s2">address well I want to I want to point</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.950" end="00:23:05.540" style="s2">out that the tragedy of taking the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.330" end="00:23:08.090" style="s2">values that are the stuff power is made</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.540" end="00:23:10.550" style="s2">of and not democratizing them basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.090" end="00:23:13.730" style="s2">declaring them null and void is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.550" end="00:23:15.080" style="s2">it&#39;s utterly tragic and it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.730" end="00:23:16.850" style="s2">not going to work because anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.080" end="00:23:18.680" style="s2">holds on to those tools is going to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.850" end="00:23:20.990" style="s2">an advantage over anybody who decides</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.680" end="00:23:24.470" style="s2">those tools are not the stuff of power</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.990" end="00:23:26.630" style="s2">so the only right solution has ever been</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.470" end="00:23:27.920" style="s2">to democratize these things and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.630" end="00:23:30.890" style="s2">distribute them as widely as possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.920" end="00:23:33.140" style="s2">yeah so in some sense I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.890" end="00:23:34.910" style="s2">concede that far if you can just simply</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.140" end="00:23:37.430" style="s2">recognize hey there&#39;s stuff that makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.910" end="00:23:39.830" style="s2">people powerful like for example science</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.430" end="00:23:42.980" style="s2">right you got two choices we can also</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.830" end="00:23:45.560" style="s2">declare science we can declare it unfair</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.980" end="00:23:47.720" style="s2">or null and void or whatever we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.560" end="00:23:48.950" style="s2">hashtag shutdown stem right what world</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.720" end="00:23:51.320" style="s2">does that lead to if we decide that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.950" end="00:23:53.180" style="s2">science is no longer valid it leads to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.320" end="00:23:55.400" style="s2">world in which whoever didn&#39;t listen to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.180" end="00:23:57.020" style="s2">us has the advantage or we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:23:58.610" style="s2">democratize science and we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.020" end="00:24:01.100" style="s2">do it right you and I were doing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.610" end="00:24:04.040" style="s2">for 15 years it&#39;s not it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.100" end="00:24:06.740" style="s2">enjoyable rewarding work to democratize</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.040" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">science so the same goes almost everyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.740" end="00:24:13.100" style="s2">who showed up in our classrooms was</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:15.160" style="s2">capable of learning and grappling with</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.100" end="00:24:18.230" style="s2">the tools of scientific inquiry of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.160" end="00:24:20.270" style="s2">observing patterns and posing hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.230" end="00:24:22.580" style="s2">and trying to distinguish between those</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.270" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">hypotheses and you know some of our</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.580" end="00:24:26.390" style="s2">students came from elite academic</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:27.800" style="s2">backgrounds but most of them did not</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.619" end="00:30:41.369" style="s2">nope because the very fact of objecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.869" end="00:30:42.929" style="s2">meant that they were going to portray it</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.730" end="00:31:44.380" style="s2">couple times from the book she says she</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.740" end="00:32:01.180" style="s2">right about one thing she&#39;s racist like</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.750" end="00:32:03.880" style="s2">Robert D&#39;Angelo is actually racist and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.180" end="00:32:06.310" style="s2">it seems that it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.880" end="00:32:08.020" style="s2">her personal racism that has projected</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.950" end="00:32:56.410" style="s2">fact it&#39;s another rhetorical trick and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.530" end="00:33:00.490" style="s2">it&#39;s I think the central Kafka trap of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.410" end="00:33:02.170" style="s2">the entire book urx no I&#39;m not by</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.490" end="00:33:04.570" style="s2">denying that you&#39;re X you&#39;ve proven that</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.170" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">you&#39;re X classic Kafka trap and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.570" end="00:33:11.970" style="s2">the only bit of argumentation in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:14.920" style="s2">book that she actually engages in so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.970" end="00:33:20.750" style="s2">like this model it makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.920" end="00:33:22.670" style="s2">to me here&#39;s the question I have so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.750" end="00:33:23.900" style="s2">assume the Robyn D&#39;Angelo is</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.670" end="00:33:27.100" style="s2">well-intentioned</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.900" end="00:33:29.870" style="s2">he&#39;s obviously getting quite wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.100" end="00:33:33.350" style="s2">advancing this particular wrong set of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.870" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">ideas it is possible though that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.350" end="00:33:38.810" style="s2">know we have argued that people have</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">better access by orders of magnitude to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.810" end="00:33:42.920" style="s2">what takes place in their own mind than</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:45.950" style="s2">they do to the next closest mind to them</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.920" end="00:33:47.210" style="s2">right you can see into your own mind not</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.950" end="00:33:48.650" style="s2">perfectly there&#39;s lots of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.210" end="00:33:51.800" style="s2">happens in our minds that we can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.650" end="00:33:54.710" style="s2">but but we do have some access to what</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.800" end="00:33:56.450" style="s2">goes on inside of our own minds so Robyn</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.710" end="00:33:58.550" style="s2">D&#39;Angelo looking to her into her own</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:01.700" style="s2">mind has discovered some completely</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.550" end="00:34:05.180" style="s2">preposterous stuff and yes it offensive</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.700" end="00:34:07.040" style="s2">if you look at it and you know it&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.180" end="00:34:09.889" style="s2">not sure I would say it was racist</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.040" end="00:34:11.899" style="s2">because the question is does she want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.889" end="00:34:15.620" style="s2">see it that way it&#39;s clearly prejudiced</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.899" end="00:34:17.210" style="s2">right but the point is I&#39;m able to hide</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.620" end="00:34:18.470" style="s2">my surprise that the black man is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.210" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">school principal I mean these are just</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.470" end="00:34:22.580" style="s2">two but there&#39;s it&#39;s riddled throughout</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:26.540" style="s2">the book oh right that that&#39;s hurt</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.580" end="00:34:29.360" style="s2">speaking so she clearly has this shared</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.540" end="00:34:34.190" style="s2">right well here&#39;s the point she has</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.360" end="00:34:36.080" style="s2">effectively portrayed all she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.190" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on in other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.080" end="00:34:40.610" style="s2">minds yeah so having looked into her own</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:42.110" style="s2">mind maybe she&#39;s just decided you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.610" end="00:34:43.970" style="s2">her mind is a good model for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.110" end="00:34:45.830" style="s2">else&#39;s and it isn&#39;t she&#39;s put a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.970" end="00:34:47.480" style="s2">to herself and then declared that she</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.830" end="00:34:49.460" style="s2">put a mirror up to society and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.480" end="00:34:51.020" style="s2">trained as a sociologist putting a</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.460" end="00:34:52.550" style="s2">mirror to society is what sociology is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.020" end="00:34:54.590" style="s2">supposed to be of course sociology has</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.550" end="00:34:56.120" style="s2">long since captured and ridiculous not</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.590" end="00:34:57.530" style="s2">everyone there&#39;s some excellent</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.120" end="00:35:00.830" style="s2">sociologists out there Nicolas course I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.530" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t being one he you know sociology</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.830" end="00:35:04.670" style="s2">suggests it&#39;s more scientific than it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:09.020" style="s2">I would say she is on the sociopath oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.670" end="00:35:14.690" style="s2">good it was inexpensive so I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.020" end="00:35:16.370" style="s2">thought I&#39;d try it out yeah that cricket</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.690" end="00:35:19.460" style="s2">audio I need the cricket audio yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.370" end="00:35:23.420" style="s2">but anyway it does it does seem like she</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.460" end="00:35:25.190" style="s2">is projecting and one would imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.420" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">she knows better than this but even if</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.190" end="00:35:29.900" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t how tragic is it that we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:32.150" style="s2">going to grind civilization to a halt</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.900" end="00:35:34.250" style="s2">over a misunderstanding over whether</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.150" end="00:35:35.900" style="s2">what goes on in Robin D&#39;Angelo&#39;s MA</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.250" end="00:35:39.230" style="s2">is a good match for what goes on and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.900" end="00:35:41.630" style="s2">everybody else is mine and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.230" end="00:35:44.450" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s stunning yeah I will</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.630" end="00:35:46.970" style="s2">point out yeah friend of ours on Twitter</p>

<p begin="00:40:16.550" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">here from 1991 this is you know my glib</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.880" end="00:40:24.740" style="s2">college writings but postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:26.270" style="s2">responding to someone something someone</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.790" end="00:40:34.370" style="s2">what we do and start a new modern yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.640" end="00:40:35.600" style="s2">modern says better yet honor and respect</p>

<p begin="00:41:05.600" end="00:41:12.620" style="s2">and part of the question is you know how</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.100" end="00:41:15.410" style="s2">is it that many of us were being exposed</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.620" end="00:41:17.240" style="s2">to these pretty ridiculous ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.410" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">college campuses I think starting you</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.240" end="00:41:21.680" style="s2">know really in the mid 80s is when it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:23.540" style="s2">began to gain steam through sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.680" end="00:41:25.220" style="s2">mid nineties and then it really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.540" end="00:41:27.890" style="s2">died down you know we saw a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.220" end="00:41:29.210" style="s2">of in grad school and it mostly wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.890" end="00:41:33.890" style="s2">at the point that we were professors</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.210" end="00:41:36.440" style="s2">starting in 2002 2001 - I wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.890" end="00:41:41.330" style="s2">and then it really started uptick again</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.440" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">in in through the 2010s and it has</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.330" end="00:41:45.560" style="s2">struck me for a long time that this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:48.050" style="s2">about those students back when we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.560" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">students who did not laugh at this and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.050" end="00:41:52.580" style="s2">try to understand it such that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:55.460" style="s2">could fight against it with intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.580" end="00:41:56.690" style="s2">tools actually became professors of</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.460" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">these fields and then they started</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.690" end="00:42:01.130" style="s2">proliferating because the fields</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">themselves began to proliferate and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.130" end="00:42:05.690" style="s2">have now been churning out students who</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:07.000" style="s2">have now been moving into media and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.690" end="00:42:10.750" style="s2">journalism and are</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.000" end="00:42:12.670" style="s2">and academia themselves and and so we</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.750" end="00:42:15.160" style="s2">have a cycle that is growing in momentum</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.670" end="00:42:16.870" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve long liked your point about</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.160" end="00:42:18.790" style="s2">this which is that part of what we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.870" end="00:42:21.010" style="s2">seeing is a generational phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.790" end="00:42:22.810" style="s2">right where these people who were</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.010" end="00:42:26.530" style="s2">studying these what we&#39;ve called phony</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.810" end="00:42:29.230" style="s2">fields have now matured into a higher</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.530" end="00:42:32.350" style="s2">level of power in the Academy and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.230" end="00:42:34.630" style="s2">has resulted in other fields that have</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.350" end="00:42:38.080" style="s2">long laughed this stuff off being unable</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.630" end="00:42:40.750" style="s2">to resist because the the power within</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.080" end="00:42:42.940" style="s2">the various faculties is distributed</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.750" end="00:42:45.970" style="s2">such that they can&#39;t but I want as long</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.940" end="00:42:48.670" style="s2">as we&#39;re here mm-hmm I want to steal man</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.970" end="00:42:50.890" style="s2">the postmoderns right and then talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.670" end="00:42:52.270" style="s2">about what what the competition really</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.890" end="00:42:56.050" style="s2">is here okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.270" end="00:42:58.540" style="s2">the postmoderns have in my opinion one</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.050" end="00:43:00.730" style="s2">punt and it&#39;s a good one but it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.540" end="00:43:04.180" style="s2">point it&#39;s not the basis for field after</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.730" end="00:43:08.530" style="s2">field the one point is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.180" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">humans and we have only our perception</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.530" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">as the basis for everything we think and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:14.530" style="s2">even to the extent that you might have</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:15.910" style="s2">tools that would allow you to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.530" end="00:43:18.250" style="s2">something what we would claim is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.910" end="00:43:20.920" style="s2">objectively your interaction with those</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.250" end="00:43:22.990" style="s2">tools is still subjective right so and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.920" end="00:43:25.750" style="s2">this is true it is true and it results</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.990" end="00:43:27.580" style="s2">in a lot of places where bias leaks in</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.580" end="00:43:35.290" style="s2">supposed to be absolutely analytical and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.510" end="00:43:37.810" style="s2">rigorous and devoid of all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.290" end="00:43:40.510" style="s2">that might bias us it can&#39;t be totally</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.810" end="00:43:41.740" style="s2">right now here&#39;s the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.510" end="00:43:43.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s the steel man version</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.740" end="00:43:46.120" style="s2">perception is between you and the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.960" end="00:43:48.850" style="s2">you can&#39;t escape that and because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.120" end="00:43:50.410" style="s2">that bias is impossible to stamp out</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.850" end="00:43:52.470" style="s2">completely and I believe that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.410" end="00:43:55.810" style="s2">actually that&#39;s accurate</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.470" end="00:43:59.170" style="s2">however if you were going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.810" end="00:44:00.850" style="s2">stamp out bias the number one tool you</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.170" end="00:44:03.730" style="s2">would want in your arsenal arguably the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.850" end="00:44:05.710" style="s2">only tool you need is science because</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.730" end="00:44:07.150" style="s2">what science does the entire reason that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.710" end="00:44:09.910" style="s2">it exists the entire reason that it has</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.150" end="00:44:12.130" style="s2">beaten every other system is that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.910" end="00:44:13.840" style="s2">will tell you what&#39;s true in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.130" end="00:44:15.850" style="s2">your bias now you have to do it right if</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.840" end="00:44:17.650" style="s2">you have a corrupt system if you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.850" end="00:44:19.840" style="s2">you know monetary corruption that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.650" end="00:44:20.410" style="s2">influenced you know how quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.840" end="00:44:21.850" style="s2">sian</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.410" end="00:44:23.380" style="s2">gets done because it&#39;s only the people</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.850" end="00:44:25.870" style="s2">who succeed at some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.380" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">non-scientific phenomenon like grant</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.870" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">writing you have repeat of a good old</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">boy network sort of saying with</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.540" style="s2">peer-review yeah you can have all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:36.610" style="s2">of things interfere with proper science</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.540" end="00:44:38.770" style="s2">but if you can do the science properly</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.610" end="00:44:40.930" style="s2">and you can be vigilant about stamping</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.770" end="00:44:42.940" style="s2">out the things that cause science not to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.930" end="00:44:44.380" style="s2">be done properly then science will force</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.940" end="00:44:46.810" style="s2">you to discover the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.380" end="00:44:50.110" style="s2">don&#39;t intuitively believe right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.810" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">what it does and so yes the postmoderns</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.110" end="00:44:56.350" style="s2">are right bias is a serious problem what</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:58.120" style="s2">do you do about it you science it to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.350" end="00:44:59.800" style="s2">extent that your science is influenced</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.120" end="00:45:00.730" style="s2">by things that it shouldn&#39;t be and is</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.800" end="00:45:02.740" style="s2">therefore biased</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.730" end="00:45:05.050" style="s2">what&#39;s the solution to that better</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.740" end="00:45:06.490" style="s2">science more science its science that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.050" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">the answer to post-modernism and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.490" end="00:45:10.930" style="s2">always has been so so I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:12.750" style="s2">gonna add I&#39;m gonna say okay I think if</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.930" end="00:45:15.550" style="s2">I have to pick one it&#39;s gonna be science</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.750" end="00:45:17.080" style="s2">but I want two things I mean I want more</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.550" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">I want more than that but I want science</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.080" end="00:45:23.980" style="s2">and I want art because art allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:27.400" style="s2">view the world to other people&#39;s lenses</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.980" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">and you know post-modernism at least</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.400" end="00:45:33.340" style="s2">it&#39;s modern crazy corrupt instantiations</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:35.230" style="s2">are specifically demanding of us that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.340" end="00:45:37.510" style="s2">not see the world to other people&#39;s eyes</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.230" end="00:45:40.090" style="s2">that if we claim to be able to than we</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.510" end="00:45:44.140" style="s2">are somehow revealing our own bigotry</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.090" end="00:45:46.510" style="s2">but art especially narrative art you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.140" end="00:45:49.780" style="s2">know as especially fiction in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.510" end="00:45:53.080" style="s2">form but to the art 3d art any of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.780" end="00:45:56.050" style="s2">also just allows you to stand in someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.080" end="00:45:57.910" style="s2">else&#39;s footsteps and see and science</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.050" end="00:46:00.060" style="s2">does this in a very different way and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.910" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">and if I have to pick one I pick science</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.060" end="00:46:05.950" style="s2">but science and art together are are</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:08.530" style="s2">going to be an incredibly potent</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.950" end="00:46:12.370" style="s2">rejoinder to this movement and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.530" end="00:46:17.410" style="s2">I am not too surprised to find the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.370" end="00:46:20.260" style="s2">shutdown stem movement and the the very</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.410" end="00:46:23.620" style="s2">wide number of organizations that we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.260" end="00:46:25.030" style="s2">hearing from and seeing in the arts that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.620" end="00:46:27.370" style="s2">are being gone after by this movement</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.030" end="00:46:29.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s they&#39;re being targeted so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.370" end="00:46:31.720" style="s2">like this I still think it&#39;s the science</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.650" end="00:46:34.270" style="s2">that narrowly corrects for the bias but</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.720" end="00:46:36.100" style="s2">the fact is nobody reads scientist</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.270" end="00:46:37.570" style="s2">papers I mean scientists do right in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.100" end="00:46:39.250" style="s2">their own field and sometimes they read</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.570" end="00:46:41.500" style="s2">a little farther afield than that but</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.250" end="00:46:42.520" style="s2">what moves the world is the conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.500" end="00:46:43.960" style="s2">that you come up with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.520" end="00:46:45.970" style="s2">counterintuitive things that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.960" end="00:46:47.830" style="s2">discover through this process that then</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.970" end="00:46:51.100" style="s2">get incorporated into something</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.830" end="00:46:52.210" style="s2">beautiful and intuitive and provocative</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.100" end="00:46:55.900" style="s2">enough to capture people&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.210" end="00:46:59.170" style="s2">which tends to be it&#39;s not even always</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.900" end="00:47:00.460" style="s2">narrative I said I said it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.170" end="00:47:03.070" style="s2">point to a narrative but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.460" end="00:47:05.260" style="s2">out of 2d art 3d or you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.070" end="00:47:08.350" style="s2">thinking about just staring at an</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.260" end="00:47:10.450" style="s2">amazing sculpture even an abstract one</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.350" end="00:47:13.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s easier to do if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.450" end="00:47:14.950" style="s2">non abstract sculpture but yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.240" end="00:47:17.830" style="s2">learn something about a different mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.950" end="00:47:21.220" style="s2">about a different human beings mind by</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.830" end="00:47:22.780" style="s2">by walking around some piece of art</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.220" end="00:47:25.020" style="s2">that&#39;s been created that is the product</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.780" end="00:47:26.560" style="s2">of another human mind and not even</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.020" end="00:47:29.110" style="s2">necessarily mine</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.560" end="00:47:30.940" style="s2">the mind is an interface and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.110" end="00:47:32.200" style="s2">the mind is the point and its content is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.940" end="00:47:34.870" style="s2">the point and that&#39;s what you discover</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.200" end="00:47:38.740" style="s2">but even something like you know there</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.870" end="00:47:43.260" style="s2">are some of these images of sculptures</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.740" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">that very effectively capture the finest</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.260" end="00:47:49.180" style="s2">fabric flowing as if in the wind and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:50.590" style="s2">it&#39;s so compelling yeah you know or</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.180" end="00:47:52.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a famous sculpture with</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.590" end="00:47:55.510" style="s2">somebody&#39;s hand on somebody&#39;s leg and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:57.550" style="s2">the way the fingers depress the skin of</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.510" end="00:48:00.460" style="s2">the person and the point is it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.550" end="00:48:02.850" style="s2">compelling that it actually reveals</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.460" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">something how could you render something</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.850" end="00:48:09.640" style="s2">soft out of stone right so even that</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.870" style="s2">counterpoint tells you something about</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.640" end="00:48:18.040" style="s2">the way the world works or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.870" end="00:48:20.500" style="s2">frequently stunned by what is revealed</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.040" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">by just simply changing one parameter of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.500" end="00:48:25.900" style="s2">something you can observe yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:29.890" style="s2">stop-motion reveal certain things or you</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.900" end="00:48:32.010" style="s2">know the the way if you look at clouds</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.890" end="00:48:36.010" style="s2">and mountains and the way they interact</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.010" end="00:48:38.290" style="s2">in a time-lapse and the thing is you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.010" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">read in a textbook all you want that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.290" end="00:48:44.050" style="s2">atmosphere functions as a fluid right</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:46.450" style="s2">but until you see yeah until you see</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.050" end="00:48:48.999" style="s2">what the mountain does to the clouds as</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.450" end="00:48:50.829" style="s2">they move around it</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.999" end="00:48:55.799" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like what we used to say you</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.829" end="00:48:58.509" style="s2">know enzyme is a catalyst not really</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.799" end="00:49:00.609" style="s2">complete yes it&#39;s a catalyst in the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.509" end="00:49:02.289" style="s2">way the factory is a catalyst right a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.609" end="00:49:06.579" style="s2">factory is a catalyst for making cars</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.289" end="00:49:08.049" style="s2">right I mean you can so having time</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.579" end="00:49:12.279" style="s2">lapse is obviously a fairly modern</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.049" end="00:49:14.349" style="s2">phenomenon but I think also art has has</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.279" end="00:49:16.299" style="s2">probably revealed what is possible and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.349" end="00:49:18.130" style="s2">opened up technological worlds very</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.299" end="00:49:19.930" style="s2">often so the example that came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.130" end="00:49:20.979" style="s2">when you were talking that I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.930" end="00:49:23.589" style="s2">there&#39;s history written on this and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.979" end="00:49:27.940" style="s2">just I don&#39;t know it but pointillism the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.589" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">what is this 19th or 20th century 19th</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.940" end="00:49:33.880" style="s2">20th century turned the century art form</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:37.749" style="s2">in which dots are used to convey great</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.880" end="00:49:40.569" style="s2">precision in in vast scenes seems to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.749" end="00:49:42.789" style="s2">presage the idea of pixels like you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.569" end="00:49:45.130" style="s2">this the the idea that you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.789" end="00:49:47.589" style="s2">reveal things through points was that in</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.130" end="00:49:49.450" style="s2">people&#39;s heads in da Vinci&#39;s time well</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.589" end="00:49:51.519" style="s2">you might have been she said maybe so</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.450" end="00:49:55.390" style="s2">much was but my art history is weak but</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.519" end="00:49:57.069" style="s2">yeah the Impressionists predate point</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.390" end="00:49:59.319" style="s2">the formal pointillist I think so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.069" end="00:50:02.739" style="s2">and I think what you&#39;re getting at is</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.160" end="00:51:29.240" style="s2">need an update or radical change but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.710" end="00:51:31.010" style="s2">don&#39;t need to we need to actually build</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.240" end="00:51:32.630" style="s2">a whole new foundation over here with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.010" end="00:51:35.450" style="s2">new kind of science because the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.630" end="00:51:37.700" style="s2">categories we were using you know of boy</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.450" end="00:51:39.799" style="s2">I&#39;m also not up-to-date on the various</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.700" end="00:51:42.349" style="s2">older versions of what the world is made</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.799" end="00:51:45.980" style="s2">of but you know it turns out that fire</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.349" end="00:51:48.829" style="s2">earth water and air are not the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.980" end="00:51:50.269" style="s2">basal elements of life right right so</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.829" end="00:51:51.559" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of hints at the periodic table</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.269" end="00:51:52.789" style="s2">but it didn&#39;t get there it&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.559" end="00:51:55.460" style="s2">wrong thing you don&#39;t get there and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.789" end="00:51:57.170" style="s2">couldn&#39;t you could not just do a brick</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.460" end="00:51:59.089" style="s2">in the wall model from fire earth water</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.170" end="00:52:01.250" style="s2">and air to get to the periodic table you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.089" end="00:52:04.069" style="s2">actually need to go all the way back in</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.250" end="00:52:05.480" style="s2">the decision tree to the question what</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.069" end="00:52:08.799" style="s2">are what is it made of what are the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.480" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">fundamentals and rebuild from there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.799" end="00:52:13.660" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s just a very that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:17.420" style="s2">good way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.660" end="00:52:19.849" style="s2">so I guess so where oh I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.420" end="00:52:21.769" style="s2">exact thing we started work yeah 50 55</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.849" end="00:52:25.279" style="s2">minutes 50 or 55 minutes all right so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.769" end="00:52:27.559" style="s2">have a few minutes left I guess um did</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.279" end="00:52:29.059" style="s2">you have something in mind with yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.559" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s spend a couple minutes here</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.059" end="00:52:35.690" style="s2">so I was listening to your conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:38.509" style="s2">with Eric in the podcast that you did</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.690" end="00:52:41.829" style="s2">with him a couple weeks ago to a CO and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.509" end="00:52:44.029" style="s2">you mentioned flatland and I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.829" end="00:52:47.000" style="s2">imagine that most of our listeners</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.029" end="00:52:48.380" style="s2">viewers know this book but it prompted</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.000" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">me to think this and I know you want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.380" end="00:52:52.279" style="s2">add something to this so this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:55.250" style="s2">this book I think you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.279" end="00:53:00.289" style="s2">flatland by Edwin Abbott it was written</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.250" end="00:53:02.359" style="s2">in 1884 Victorian era England and I read</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.289" end="00:53:05.420" style="s2">it when I was 12 11 or 12 something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.359" end="00:53:08.779" style="s2">that and I had two very distinct</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.420" end="00:53:11.000" style="s2">reactions to it one of my reactions was</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.779" end="00:53:12.799" style="s2">in line with why I think you invoked it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.000" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">in that conversation with Eric which was</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.799" end="00:53:16.190" style="s2">it provides</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:18.410" style="s2">it does exactly we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.190" end="00:53:21.320" style="s2">about in fact it provides a lens into</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.410" end="00:53:22.850" style="s2">imagining what it might be like to live</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.320" end="00:53:25.220" style="s2">in a universe in which there are things</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.850" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">bigger than the universe that you live</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.220" end="00:53:29.210" style="s2">in and therefore so outside your sphere</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:32.360" style="s2">of experience that you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.210" end="00:53:33.800" style="s2">interpret them so when a sphere walks</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.360" end="00:53:36.860" style="s2">through the flat the 2-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.800" end="00:53:38.900" style="s2">flatland universe of abbott and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.860" end="00:53:40.700" style="s2">haven&#39;t reread it in decades so in line</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.900" end="00:53:42.260" style="s2">I may be butchering it a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.700" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">when a sphere comes through the plane</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.260" end="00:53:49.160" style="s2">that is flatland it looks like first a</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:51.170" style="s2">point and then a line and then I I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.160" end="00:53:52.910" style="s2">guess it be a point and then a circle</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.170" end="00:53:53.930" style="s2">that gets bigger and then a circle and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.910" end="00:53:57.080" style="s2">then a point and then it disappears</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.930" end="00:53:59.000" style="s2">again but it can never reveal itself as</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.080" end="00:54:01.490" style="s2">a sphere because spheres don&#39;t exist in</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.000" end="00:54:04.850" style="s2">a two-dimensional landscape and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.490" end="00:54:06.770" style="s2">that alone that understanding what won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.850" end="00:54:08.420" style="s2">be understandable what won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.770" end="00:54:11.060" style="s2">comprehensible even if you can get</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.420" end="00:54:13.490" style="s2">glimmers of it in your current world is</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.060" end="00:54:14.990" style="s2">amazing and I think it along with so</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.490" end="00:54:16.790" style="s2">many other experiences in my life helped</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.990" end="00:54:18.290" style="s2">me think about you know how so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.790" end="00:54:20.210" style="s2">know you know how what are the questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.290" end="00:54:21.700" style="s2">we could ask and how would we end up</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.210" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">answering those questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.700" end="00:54:28.160" style="s2">so it was greatly foundational for me</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">when I read it and then it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.160" end="00:54:33.650" style="s2">that this book is deeply sexist now it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:36.470" style="s2">is I just I went to Wikipedia just</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.650" end="00:54:39.650" style="s2">before this to see um Justin let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.470" end="00:54:41.720" style="s2">deeply sexist it&#39;s objectively sex it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.650" end="00:54:44.060" style="s2">objectively sexist but no mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.720" end="00:54:45.770" style="s2">substitute here&#39;s the thing wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.060" end="00:54:47.300" style="s2">says it&#39;s satire in the circle right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.770" end="00:54:49.100" style="s2">let&#39;s just put that aside because I</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.300" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">think this is a revisionist history but</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.100" end="00:54:53.780" style="s2">you know who knows like mate maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">the fact is that in the two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.780" end="00:55:00.290" style="s2">landscape where males are triangles or</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:01.550" style="s2">squares and they aspire to be circles</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.290" end="00:55:04.150" style="s2">with sort of an infinite number of sides</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.550" end="00:55:06.350" style="s2">they&#39;re there for 2d they&#39;re polygons</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.150" end="00:55:07.940" style="s2">females are one-dimensional they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.350" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">lines and then the one-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.940" end="00:55:11.930" style="s2">landscape were where men are lines women</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:15.880" style="s2">are dots and in the three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.930" end="00:55:19.580" style="s2">landscape where where men are cubes or</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.880" end="00:55:22.070" style="s2">spheres women are polygons it&#39;s insane</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.580" end="00:55:24.770" style="s2">it&#39;s deeply insulting and I read it and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.070" end="00:55:26.540" style="s2">let be kidding me and then I thought a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.770" end="00:55:27.980" style="s2">little bit about the scant that I knew</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.540" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">about the era in which he&#39;d been writing</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.980" end="00:55:31.640" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:34.099" style="s2">that point was 100 years prior and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.640" end="00:55:36.920" style="s2">thought okay well you know what I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.099" end="00:55:39.980" style="s2">still I can still get out of this book</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.920" end="00:55:43.400" style="s2">the remarkable truth in it while also</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.980" end="00:55:47.210" style="s2">being perturbed by this insanity in it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.400" end="00:55:48.230" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t actually alter the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.210" end="00:55:51.829" style="s2">value that I have in it</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.230" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">so that was 1884 there&#39;s also so this is</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.240" end="00:59:52.040" style="s2">edited to that one sentence and it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.490" end="00:59:53.690" style="s2">about one word you know I&#39;ll find video</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.040" end="00:59:56.210" style="s2">of me uttering that one word</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.690" end="00:59:57.590" style="s2">out of context and suddenly the ability</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.210" end="00:59:59.120" style="s2">to say here&#39;s what I was saying I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.590" end="01:00:01.400" style="s2">quoting Bob Dylan I was quoting Bob</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.120" end="01:00:04.130" style="s2">Dylan and a song in which he is</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.400" end="01:00:05.900" style="s2">revealing what again I don&#39;t think this</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.130" end="01:00:08.180" style="s2">is the right word but he was revealing</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.900" end="01:00:11.060" style="s2">what we now would be told is white</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.180" end="01:00:12.920" style="s2">supremacy right a system that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.060" end="01:00:15.530" style="s2">systematically indifferent to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.920" end="01:00:17.360" style="s2">interests of black people right he goes</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.530" end="01:00:20.060" style="s2">through it he explains he actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.360" end="01:00:22.760" style="s2">details not only the circumstances of</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.060" end="01:00:24.530" style="s2">the the crime and the investigation but</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.760" end="01:00:26.360" style="s2">the bad witnesses and their perverse</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.530" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">incentives and the structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.360" end="01:00:30.350" style="s2">court that Carter finds himself facing</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:32.210" style="s2">the whole and the press I mean he goes</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.350" end="01:00:35.090" style="s2">through the whole thing it&#39;s just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.210" end="01:00:36.680" style="s2">tour de force and the point is you you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.090" end="01:00:38.570" style="s2">want to rob us of that you want to rub</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.680" end="01:00:40.430" style="s2">your kids of that you want to explain</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.570" end="01:00:42.230" style="s2">white supremacy and not have that as one</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.430" end="01:00:45.110" style="s2">of the tools in your toolkit right what</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.230" end="01:00:47.330" style="s2">a song actually instrumental in getting</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.110" end="01:00:49.940" style="s2">hurricane Carter release absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.330" end="01:00:52.490" style="s2">so the point is like this is how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.940" end="01:00:54.020" style="s2">done people right it&#39;s done narrative</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.490" end="01:00:55.940" style="s2">Lee and it&#39;s done unflinchingly and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.020" end="01:00:57.320" style="s2">is not a stanza and just not I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.940" end="01:01:01.250" style="s2">understand why you try to say the words</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.320" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">I it is really against my religion okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.250" end="01:01:04.340" style="s2">to do it and say n-word because for one</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:06.020" style="s2">thing it interrupts a rhyme that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.340" end="01:01:08.450" style="s2">important to the whole thing what the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.020" end="01:01:11.690" style="s2">rhyme is obvious though yeah well okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.450" end="01:01:14.390" style="s2">so the stanza I know it by heart but can</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.690" end="01:01:18.560" style="s2">I do it in front of a family um let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.390" end="01:01:20.390" style="s2">see it was Oh to the white folks who</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.560" end="01:01:21.830" style="s2">watched he was a revolutionary bum and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.390" end="01:01:23.900" style="s2">to the black folks he was just a crazy</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.830" end="01:01:25.190" style="s2">nigger nobody doubted that he pulled the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.900" end="01:01:27.110" style="s2">trigger and though they could not</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.190" end="01:01:29.390" style="s2">produce the gun the DA said he was the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.110" end="01:01:32.450" style="s2">one who did the deed and the all-white</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.390" end="01:01:34.970" style="s2">jury agreed I mean that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.450" end="01:01:37.550" style="s2">poetry yeah right and it is a very ugly</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.970" end="01:01:39.620" style="s2">word and it has to be there in order for</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.550" end="01:01:41.030" style="s2">that piece of poetry to work yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.620" end="01:01:44.570" style="s2">think you probably couldn&#39;t have called</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.030" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">it up after after saying the word if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.570" end="01:01:47.630" style="s2">would replace it with n-word there right</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:50.090" style="s2">you what you would have lost your place</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.630" end="01:01:51.380" style="s2">I would have lost my place and I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.090" end="01:01:54.020" style="s2">have been heartbroken that this</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.380" end="01:01:57.350" style="s2">important tool had been made though I</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.020" end="01:02:00.980" style="s2">mean yeah what do you do so look I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.350" end="01:02:02.900" style="s2">just like it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s obvious that</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.980" end="01:02:05.450" style="s2">this is not a word that you are trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.900" end="01:02:06.500" style="s2">to use it&#39;s no need of that word to use</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.450" end="01:02:08.420" style="s2">in earnest but some</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.500" end="01:02:11.210" style="s2">times there&#39;s a need to discuss its use</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.420" end="01:02:14.780" style="s2">in Twain or to discuss its use by Dylan</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.210" end="01:02:17.270" style="s2">or to discuss its modern use you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.780" end="01:02:20.270" style="s2">you need discretion and you know half</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.270" end="01:02:22.130" style="s2">the only way a system can work is if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.270" end="01:02:23.990" style="s2">have discretion to decide where a use is</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.130" end="01:02:25.700" style="s2">legitimate and where a uses illegitimate</p>
