<p begin="00:00:04.500" end="00:00:12.510" style="s2">So if I’m in a competitive game and I have<br />some information about reality, the reality</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.510" end="00:00:18.180" style="s2">of the playing field that I’m in then that<br />information can be a source of strategic competitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.180" end="00:00:22.750" style="s2">advantage against whoever I’m competing<br />against and so I have an incentive to withhold</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.750" end="00:00:26.940" style="s2">that information from other players and maybe<br />even disinform the other players.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.940" end="00:00:30.019" style="s2">So we see this is actual games.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.019" end="00:00:31.380" style="s2">This is bluffing in poker.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.380" end="00:00:35.900" style="s2">This is fake left and go right in soccer,<br />football.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.900" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">But we also would see this in keeping the<br />knowledge to ourselves of where the water</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">is or where the goal is from another tribe<br />or another kingdom or whatever and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:50.110" style="s2">trying to throw them off the scent trail with<br />an intentional leaked fake treasure map that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.110" end="00:00:53.990" style="s2">has them going the wrong direction so they<br />don’t accidentally discover what we discovered.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.990" end="00:00:55.540" style="s2">Things like that.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.540" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">So within a rival risk context where information<br />is strategic competitive advantage there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">an incentive to disinform.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">And as we get increasing information technology<br />which is media technology and computational</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:18.409" style="s2">technology and statistics and all these things<br />we have, we really have exponential information</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.409" end="00:01:24.220" style="s2">processing but applied to disinformation,<br />the incentive to disinform we have exponential</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.220" end="00:01:32.960" style="s2">disinformation capacity which means the ability<br />to customize inflammatory, fake news, propaganda,</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">narrative warfare to specific demographics<br />and all the way down to specific types of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:43.000" style="s2">people that are the types that are most likely<br />for that person to believe, be upset by, affect</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.000" end="00:01:44.650" style="s2">their actions.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.650" end="00:01:52.259" style="s2">So we see with social media platforms like<br />Facebook the capacity to be able to target</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.259" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">the things that are going to be the stickiest<br />for an individual and the stickiest often</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:02:01.780" style="s2">is by appealing to limbic hijacks of what<br />is scariest to them or hits addiction buttons</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.780" end="00:02:06.490" style="s2">the most or creates a sense of ingroup-outgroup<br />dynamic or things like that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.490" end="00:02:13.970" style="s2">So when you think about having a society that<br />has an incentive to both withhold information</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.970" end="00:02:21.550" style="s2">and to disinform and you think about a huge<br />number of different agents who all have increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.550" end="00:02:27.319" style="s2">disinformation capacities and you also think<br />about the radical asymmetry between an individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.319" end="00:02:31.569" style="s2">just trying to make sense of the world and<br />a huge platform like Facebook or Google or</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.569" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">a company that is doing split test, optimized<br />marketing you have an asymmetric information</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:45.550" style="s2">warfare of the largest powers in the world<br />with agendas that are not the same as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.550" end="00:02:53.480" style="s2">agenda of the individual for themselves being<br />put forth on radically powerful information</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.480" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">technology platforms.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:03:00.261" style="s2">So you look at the world today and whether<br />it’s climate change or whether it’s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.261" end="00:03:04.489" style="s2">the extent of the damage at Fukushima is or<br />what the actual tactical capabilities of North</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.489" end="00:03:10.870" style="s2">Korea are or how long we actually have with<br />coral die off or most any of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.870" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">are the most critical issues in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:20.290" style="s2">What goal other countries or what effect other<br />countries had in influencing U.S. elections.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.290" end="00:03:27.030" style="s2">No one really knows the most important things<br />clearly to be able to inform good choice-making</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.030" end="00:03:30.040" style="s2">even about how we survive as a species.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.040" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">So this is critical when we’re trying to<br />understand the current information ecology.</p>
