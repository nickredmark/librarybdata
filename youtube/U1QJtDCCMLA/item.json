Information is strategic.The current information ecology is controlled by large tech companies whose goals may be radically different from the goals of the individuals using the platforms.When it comes to critical issues like climate change, nuclear weapons stocks, and even foreign interference in U.S. elections, there is very little clear information, which impedes our decision making‚Äîthat information scarcity is devastating when our survival as a species hangs in the balance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDANIEL  SCHMACHTENBERGER\n\nDaniel Schmachtenberger is a social philosopher whose central focus is civilization design: Developing new capacities for sense-making and choice-making, individually and collectively, to support conscious sustainable evolution.
