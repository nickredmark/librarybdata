<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:50.039" style="s2">using my name in any one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">myriad of ways that it is used that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.039" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">isn&#39;t referring to me as a person and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">today I want to do that video what is in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:02.699" style="s2">a name</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.640" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">my name is Jubilee I did not choose this</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.699" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">name his name was chosen for me by my</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">parents in a large part because we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">evangelical Christian all of our names</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:16.970" style="s2">me and my two siblings come from the</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">50 years I believe people would put</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.759" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">themselves or be putting into debt</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">slavery and that would generally based</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">had this name my entire life it means</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:45.259" style="s2">that people generally remember my name</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">when I don&#39;t remember theirs</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.259" end="00:01:52.530" style="s2">it&#39;s gotten me jobs because I stand out</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:56.360" style="s2">on a resume but right now the three</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.530" end="00:02:01.939" style="s2">things that speak to me about my name</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.360" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">are that it&#39;s that thing in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.939" end="00:02:07.310" style="s2">because four things that it means</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:07.310" style="s2">celebration</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.270" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">that also becomes synonymous in the game</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:19.050" style="s2">be space and with more of the new group</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:21.390" style="s2">of people on not just debt and slaves</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.050" end="00:02:25.880" style="s2">being set free but on their actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.390" end="00:02:28.709" style="s2">being so I think on a threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.880" end="00:02:32.069" style="s2">people involved in something that then</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.709" end="00:02:35.069" style="s2">makes it safe so Jordan Hall brought</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.069" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">that up in our conversation that&#39;s on my</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.430" end="00:03:15.570" style="s2">debt for pennies on the dollar and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.530" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">just forgive it and send out letters to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.570" end="00:03:20.820" style="s2">the people instead of demanding that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:23.070" style="s2">they pay it and getting a few more cents</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.820" end="00:03:24.359" style="s2">on the dollar they save it&#39;s written off</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.070" end="00:03:25.859" style="s2">you don&#39;t know anything but if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.359" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">wanted to donate so we could buy more</p>
