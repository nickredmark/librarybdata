<p begin="00:01:12.360" end="00:01:16.909" style="s2">I forgot to bring them because we had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">little bit of drama we were leaving so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.909" end="00:01:23.490" style="s2">walked to the nearby 7-eleven in order</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">to buy some plain potato chips which was</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.490" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">that she wanted for the sleepover well I</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:29.820" style="s2">lottery ticket checked for Tuesday and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a winner enough for ticket I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.820" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">was like I kind of want to play with</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">that number I was having fun I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">play with the amount of money in my head</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:39.240" style="s2">again so I bought a ticket I was like</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">would you like the extra like no fifty</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.240" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">million or nothing</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t and then this morning when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:50.220" style="s2">went to walk the dog after our board</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">meeting I got the chicken ticket checked</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.220" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">and I thought he said it was like 9:25</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">it was like cool awesome which is about</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">the most I think ten dollars the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:02:00.329" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever won on the lottery and usually</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">I just want a free ticket that&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.329" end="00:02:02.790" style="s2">was even a little disappointed that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:04.860" style="s2">won down 25 even though you could buy</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.790" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">all those two tickets with that but then</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.860" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">I feel like I could choose to buy a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">ticket with that as opposed to when it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">gives you a free ticket there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">option and so I did buy another ticket</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">for because the number went up again</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:17.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not sixty million I was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">alright well the chances actually said</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.550" end="00:02:21.570" style="s2">kind of go down that I&#39;d bought it there</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.900" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">and redeemed it there and even he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.570" end="00:02:24.240" style="s2">like that&#39;s the largest number we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:26.670" style="s2">every one here and then I lost my wallet</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.240" end="00:02:27.990" style="s2">there so I just wouldn&#39;t picked it up it</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.670" end="00:02:29.220" style="s2">was quite but it&#39;s like the things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.990" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">had to happen I&#39;d if I take it on</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.220" end="00:02:35.630" style="s2">Tuesday it had mistakenly forgot my kids</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.810" end="00:02:47.490" style="s2">something about it run like I want it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.840" end="00:02:49.380" style="s2">facilitate the scheduling app and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.490" end="00:02:52.190" style="s2">whether that means finding someone who</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.380" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">will volunteer and critics I know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.190" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">nine hundred dollars I&#39;d have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:58.740" style="s2">somebody in another country to make it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">even that it would be low for that for</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.740" end="00:03:03.000" style="s2">that that so possibly using it for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">servers and for that kind thing but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.000" end="00:03:08.340" style="s2">gonna have a brainstorm with my brother</p>

<p begin="00:03:28.890" end="00:03:32.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not just winning the nine hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">dollars like what had to transpire for</p>
