<p begin="00:00:03.679" end="00:00:10.130" style="s2">night all day hello and welcome to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.970" end="00:00:11.599" style="s2">next part of this conversation with John</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.130" end="00:00:14.599" style="s2">for Vicki there&#39;s just a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.599" end="00:00:17.900" style="s2">I&#39;d like to tell you about it Before we</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.599" end="00:00:20.560" style="s2">jump in and the first one is that this</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.900" end="00:00:22.910" style="s2">is towards the more technical academic</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.560" end="00:00:27.130" style="s2">side of the conversations that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.910" end="00:00:30.620" style="s2">find here it&#39;s not my aim to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.130" end="00:00:34.160" style="s2">conversations always of that nature in</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.620" end="00:00:39.289" style="s2">this case I feel it&#39;s very much called</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.160" end="00:00:43.010" style="s2">for as John is a genius-level thinker in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.289" end="00:00:45.440" style="s2">my humble opinion and I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:49.399" style="s2">many of the same ideas and so for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.440" end="00:00:52.190" style="s2">really get where we could requires a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.399" end="00:00:56.089" style="s2">certain sort of dialogue that tends</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.190" end="00:00:59.350" style="s2">towards the more academic side but that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.089" end="00:01:05.750" style="s2">won&#39;t be all you find here and it is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.350" end="00:01:08.060" style="s2">very much intention of mine to speak in</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.750" end="00:01:10.580" style="s2">a way that is more accessible and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.060" end="00:01:14.860" style="s2">break down concepts when appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.580" end="00:01:17.720" style="s2">rather than just always pull from</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.860" end="00:01:21.550" style="s2">whatever tangent the unconscious seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.720" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">to be so that&#39;s the first thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.550" end="00:01:26.660" style="s2">second thing is that even if you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:30.020" style="s2">interested in a more academic style of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.660" end="00:01:32.480" style="s2">conversation you may have to put up with</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.020" end="00:01:34.820" style="s2">the first five minutes of me talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.480" end="00:01:36.920" style="s2">before we get to John I cut this</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.820" end="00:01:39.080" style="s2">conversation in half it was initially</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.920" end="00:01:42.800" style="s2">both parts 1 &amp; 2 were had it on the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.080" end="00:01:44.690" style="s2">in the same session and so the break is</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.800" end="00:01:47.210" style="s2">somewhat artificial although the jump in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.690" end="00:01:51.050" style="s2">the conversation itself was quite abrupt</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.210" end="00:01:53.120" style="s2">so even if you were to go listen to part</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.050" end="00:01:55.100" style="s2">one beforehand the jump into the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.120" end="00:01:59.420" style="s2">metaphysical component is still fairly</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.100" end="00:02:03.230" style="s2">abrupt and yeah the first five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.420" end="00:02:05.510" style="s2">are me feeling my way through setting</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.230" end="00:02:07.880" style="s2">the context for a certain sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.510" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">discussion and what you can expect to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.880" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">hear is a discussion about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">and you&#39;ll hear some of John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:21.750" style="s2">metaphysical position with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:26.069" style="s2">the ontological status of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.750" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">I won&#39;t say too much more than that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.069" end="00:02:30.810" style="s2">yeah thank you very much and I look</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.930" style="s2">forward to bringing you more content in</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.810" end="00:02:32.930" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.010" end="00:02:37.530" style="s2">okay so if you can bear with me and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.650" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">might have to help me along with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.530" end="00:02:43.690" style="s2">because of our limited time remaining I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:45.640" style="s2">want to see if I can provide a context</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.690" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">for a particular sort of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:49.959" style="s2">discussion so I can better understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:53.879" style="s2">your position on things and sure to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.959" end="00:02:57.700" style="s2">share a little bit about how where my</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.879" end="00:02:59.500" style="s2">not just interests but where my capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.700" end="00:03:02.860" style="s2">to make coherence of things currently</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.500" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">lies with and is to do with in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.860" end="00:03:08.680" style="s2">important sense what&#39;s most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:13.299" style="s2">I suppose it&#39;s to do with ontology but</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.680" end="00:03:20.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a process metaphysics where in</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.299" end="00:03:25.299" style="s2">actually our agency and our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.310" end="00:03:30.310" style="s2">draw coherence into experience might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.299" end="00:03:33.160" style="s2">used as an important vehicle to gain</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.310" end="00:03:35.890" style="s2">insight into not just psychological</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.160" end="00:03:37.269" style="s2">process of sense making and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.890" end="00:03:40.090" style="s2">cognitive process of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.269" end="00:03:43.269" style="s2">realization but perhaps to metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.090" end="00:03:47.260" style="s2">process itself and now there are some</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.269" end="00:03:49.989" style="s2">shion&#39;s involved here that that I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.260" end="00:03:51.489" style="s2">see things going different ways but for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.989" end="00:03:54.310" style="s2">example in one of your lectures you</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.489" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">talked about the importance or not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.310" end="00:03:59.069" style="s2">importance you provide a very basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:02.459" style="s2">schema of I think it goes something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.069" end="00:04:04.900" style="s2">inorganic thing it&#39;s a living thing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.459" end="00:04:07.180" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s hierarchy yes Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.900" end="00:04:09.370" style="s2">hierarchy to moving thing to mental</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:10.780" style="s2">thing to cube the human thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.370" end="00:04:12.730" style="s2">the rational thing or something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.780" end="00:04:14.739" style="s2">this which is self reflective capacities</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.730" end="00:04:18.220" style="s2">yeah the self motion eventually becomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.739" end="00:04:21.849" style="s2">self reflection right yes so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.220" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">sure whether or not that&#39;s I know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.849" end="00:04:26.889" style="s2">introducing these thinkers a lot to sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:28.870" style="s2">of help provide a framework for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.889" end="00:04:31.000" style="s2">about things in different ways and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.870" end="00:04:32.349" style="s2">sense is that you have um you know you</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.000" end="00:04:33.940" style="s2">have an affinity for each of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.349" end="00:04:35.590" style="s2">thinkers in a different way and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.940" end="00:04:38.289" style="s2">not taking it that that is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.590" end="00:04:41.229" style="s2">what you endorse metaphysically but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.289" end="00:04:43.780" style="s2">where I wrote where I get where I where</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.229" end="00:04:45.790" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in is because you you</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.780" end="00:04:48.250" style="s2">speak a lot as well about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.790" end="00:04:49.870" style="s2">the the co defining into the pendant</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.250" end="00:04:52.780" style="s2">relationship between the agent and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.870" end="00:04:54.220" style="s2">arena between the cognitive agent the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.780" end="00:04:57.310" style="s2">thing that makes sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.220" end="00:04:59.980" style="s2">the environment as such so that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.310" end="00:05:02.470" style="s2">closer you are to coming into touch with</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.980" end="00:05:04.990" style="s2">that also the more real and more human</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.470" end="00:05:07.660" style="s2">you become and that is this optimization</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.990" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">process associated with realizing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.660" end="00:05:13.540" style="s2">meaning and realizing a closer fit</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:17.290" style="s2">between yourself and the environment the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.540" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">question is for this meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.290" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">process - because I agree with you it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">these practices attempting to come into</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:28.150" style="s2">communion with these practices and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:30.700" style="s2">getting lost in an autodidactic spiral</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.150" end="00:05:32.110" style="s2">although by the way autodidactic spirals</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.700" end="00:05:34.060" style="s2">are sometimes the only way you can come</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.110" end="00:05:35.290" style="s2">into yourself enough so you can connect</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.060" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">with genuine community and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.290" end="00:05:44.170" style="s2">another tension there of course hmm is</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">that okay at what point like like one</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.170" end="00:05:47.890" style="s2">issue I have is with this idea of a sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">of a radical emergence and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.890" end="00:05:52.390" style="s2">saying that you&#39;re that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">necessitating we endorse this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.390" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">radical emergence from a from a holy non</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">meaningful non-sentient non capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:05.560" style="s2">discern how to come into relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:07.720" style="s2">with there&#39;s this notion of goal right</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.560" end="00:06:10.690" style="s2">there&#39;s this notion of becoming a more</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.720" end="00:06:12.730" style="s2">actualized better fit so that what so</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">that more transformation can continue</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.730" end="00:06:16.840" style="s2">and menses and it&#39;s a kind of loving</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:20.890" style="s2">transformation right because it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.840" end="00:06:22.420" style="s2">it&#39;s an affirmation of self and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.890" end="00:06:24.490" style="s2">world in some important sense in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.420" end="00:06:26.950" style="s2">that transforms it and there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.490" end="00:06:29.590" style="s2">added an admission there that that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.950" end="00:06:32.410" style="s2">are connected in fundamental ways that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.590" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">together we come into these Co Co</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.410" end="00:06:39.850" style="s2">defining Co interpretive transformations</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.880" end="00:06:40.990" style="s2">and become something more connected more</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.850" end="00:06:44.890" style="s2">real in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.990" end="00:06:48.010" style="s2">well how fundamental is this process of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.890" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">of transformation to what we must</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.010" end="00:06:51.340" style="s2">endorse metaphysically in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:52.690" style="s2">itself we might be something to say how</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.340" end="00:06:54.790" style="s2">fundamentalist sentience how</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.690" end="00:06:57.160" style="s2">fundamentalist consciousness I find it</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.790" end="00:06:57.940" style="s2">difficult to understand how this process</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.160" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">can kick</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.940" end="00:07:02.110" style="s2">with the meaning associated the goal</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:04.480" style="s2">formation associated even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.110" end="00:07:06.490" style="s2">implicit this it gives coherence the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.480" end="00:07:09.730" style="s2">goals give coherence this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.490" end="00:07:12.100" style="s2">to meet in kind of a unity of goals a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.730" end="00:07:14.980" style="s2">unity of becoming of harmonizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.100" end="00:07:17.260" style="s2">evermore in this holistic way right it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.980" end="00:07:19.960" style="s2">seems to me like I can&#39;t understand how</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.260" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">this is not fundamental to being itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.960" end="00:07:24.190" style="s2">at least as far as we can conceive it</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:26.140" style="s2">psychologically and then the lighter</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.190" end="00:07:27.820" style="s2">comes between psychological psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.140" end="00:07:29.020" style="s2">and metaphysics becomes blurred so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.820" end="00:07:33.070" style="s2">interested in the role you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.020" end="00:07:36.310" style="s2">something like this subjective coherence</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.070" end="00:07:38.590" style="s2">making transformation plays in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.310" end="00:07:40.330" style="s2">metaphysics is consciousness fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.590" end="00:07:41.710" style="s2">is something like sentience fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.330" end="00:07:46.030" style="s2">or is it an emergent property of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.710" end="00:07:47.980" style="s2">something that is non-sentient okay so</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.030" end="00:07:50.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.980" end="00:07:52.420" style="s2">very complex question yes the first the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.230" end="00:07:53.980" style="s2">first thing is and I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.420" end="00:07:56.140" style="s2">you&#39;re committed to some of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.980" end="00:07:57.910" style="s2">predicates but I would argue that our</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.140" end="00:08:00.490" style="s2">meaning is not subjective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.910" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">transgender and part of the ontology</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.490" end="00:08:05.590" style="s2">that I&#39;m trying to advocate for is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:07.600" style="s2">ontology of real relations right that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.590" end="00:08:10.270" style="s2">relations aren&#39;t just sort of mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.600" end="00:08:12.850" style="s2">glue that we use to to to take to put</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.270" end="00:08:15.190" style="s2">things together and I think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.850" end="00:08:16.750" style="s2">actually something that is comports well</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.190" end="00:08:19.450" style="s2">with our scientific ontology because</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.750" end="00:08:20.590" style="s2">things like evolution are dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.450" end="00:08:23.110" style="s2">systems themselves they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.590" end="00:08:25.660" style="s2">self-organizing processes and I take it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.110" end="00:08:27.430" style="s2">that you do there&#39;s a general consensus</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.660" end="00:08:29.530" style="s2">that evolution is the best explanation</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.430" end="00:08:31.810" style="s2">of how we actually got here and if</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.530" end="00:08:35.469" style="s2">therefore there has to be a reality to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.810" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">it as a causal factor in our emergence</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.469" end="00:08:40.450" style="s2">and therefore these dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:42.969" style="s2">and the sets of constraints that and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.450" end="00:08:45.280" style="s2">real relations that they embody are real</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.969" end="00:08:48.220" style="s2">and causally efficacious and in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.280" end="00:08:50.920" style="s2">important way so I take that to be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.220" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">fundamental thing and then once you give</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.920" end="00:08:56.670" style="s2">me that in my ontology then I would talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:59.620" style="s2">about I talk about two things first I</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.670" end="00:09:01.960" style="s2">talk about it in terms of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.620" end="00:09:04.960" style="s2">continuity hypothesis the idea that my</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.960" end="00:09:06.430" style="s2">my friend and a colleague Evan Thompson</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.960" end="00:09:08.770" style="s2">has developed out of the work of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.430" end="00:09:10.450" style="s2">Francisco Varela and others and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.770" end="00:09:10.960" style="s2">the idea and this actually comes out in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.450" end="00:09:13.980" style="s2">the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.960" end="00:09:18.010" style="s2">realization theory this is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.980" end="00:09:20.020" style="s2">the the the system of constraints right</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.010" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">that structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.020" end="00:09:24.580" style="s2">and this is this is very much the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:27.310" style="s2">Aristotelian model that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.580" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">possible as a biological agent that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.310" end="00:09:32.290" style="s2">right now those sets right of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.270" style="s2">constraints they get accepted they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.290" end="00:09:36.100" style="s2">not identical they get exactly the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.270" end="00:09:39.010" style="s2">my tongue has been exacted for speech</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.100" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">they get exact it up into cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.010" end="00:09:44.200" style="s2">they get exact it up into other other</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:46.990" style="s2">levels of our notion of self and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.200" end="00:09:49.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep continuity between the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.990" end="00:09:51.850" style="s2">kind of self organizational processes we</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.840" end="00:09:54.190" style="s2">find in the depths of our biology and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.850" end="00:09:57.670" style="s2">that we find in the height of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.190" end="00:10:00.600" style="s2">reflective rationality and many people</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.670" end="00:10:02.860" style="s2">are arguing for this deep continuity now</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.600" end="00:10:05.730" style="s2">you may say well you know that gets me</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.860" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">sort of in that that I can sort of seed</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.730" end="00:10:11.350" style="s2">right and that&#39;s a kind but that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:13.630" style="s2">taking me sort of into one layer of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.350" end="00:10:15.780" style="s2">ontology well no because I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.630" end="00:10:18.460" style="s2">also a deep continuity between being a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.780" end="00:10:22.930" style="s2">biological thing which is an auto poetic</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.460" end="00:10:24.730" style="s2">thing a self organs are self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.930" end="00:10:26.200" style="s2">systems that are self organized to seek</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.730" end="00:10:28.030" style="s2">out the conditions of their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.200" end="00:10:29.830" style="s2">existence yes and that&#39;s how they differ</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.030" end="00:10:32.500" style="s2">from merely self-organizing things like</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.830" end="00:10:33.730" style="s2">tornados that do not self makes in a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.500" end="00:10:36.310" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.730" end="00:10:39.460" style="s2">so autopoietic is self making exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.310" end="00:10:40.840" style="s2">whereas the the tornado is only</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.460" end="00:10:44.020" style="s2">self-organizing but there&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.840" end="00:10:47.080" style="s2">again continuity between what we see in</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.020" end="00:10:52.230" style="s2">the in the self making seeking behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.080" end="00:10:55.990" style="s2">of of you know even a Paramecium and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.230" end="00:10:58.450" style="s2">self-organization right capacity that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.990" end="00:11:01.800" style="s2">see in the fire that is spreading so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.450" end="00:11:04.870" style="s2">can with instead of just reading upwards</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.800" end="00:11:07.330" style="s2">right you also should use your ontology</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.870" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">and read downwards you should see how</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.330" end="00:11:12.340" style="s2">the upper-level thing gives you an</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:14.500" style="s2">affordance of intelligibility down into</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.340" end="00:11:16.960" style="s2">the depths of your ontology and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.500" end="00:11:18.220" style="s2">that leads me to my second point now</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.960" end="00:11:21.010" style="s2">this is not something I have as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.220" end="00:11:23.860" style="s2">developed and so I ask for some charity</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.010" end="00:11:24.520" style="s2">on the part of your your your listeners</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.860" end="00:11:27.670" style="s2">but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.520" end="00:11:30.520" style="s2">become increasingly sort of critical of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.670" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">these two big things that we have tended</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.520" end="00:11:35.590" style="s2">to do with our ontology we tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:38.050" style="s2">a completely emergentist ontology in</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.590" end="00:11:39.910" style="s2">which everything emerges up or if you go</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.050" end="00:11:41.800" style="s2">back far enough in sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.910" end="00:11:43.840" style="s2">Neoplatonic framework we have the exact</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.800" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">opposite we have a completely emanation</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.840" end="00:11:49.720" style="s2">right ontology and I think both of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">ontology x&#39; and perhaps I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.720" end="00:11:52.360" style="s2">it could make a case that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:54.400" style="s2">point that Whitehead was making so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.360" end="00:11:56.770" style="s2">might find resonance with this both of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.400" end="00:11:58.990" style="s2">these ontological grammars a completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.770" end="00:12:01.840" style="s2">emergentist and a completely emanation</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.990" end="00:12:05.500" style="s2">esta count I think have like they each</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.840" end="00:12:08.260" style="s2">have just you know they have obverse</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.500" end="00:12:10.120" style="s2">sets of you know you know irresolvable</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.260" end="00:12:12.670" style="s2">problems that they can&#39;t do and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.120" end="00:12:14.770" style="s2">sort of points to me that either one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.670" end="00:12:16.990" style="s2">these exclusive ways of thinking of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.770" end="00:12:22.030" style="s2">ontology is in some fundamental way</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.990" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">flawed now and trying to get beyond both</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.030" end="00:12:27.430" style="s2">emergence and emanation I think is one</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.220" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">of the central tasks facing us as people</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.430" end="00:12:31.720" style="s2">are trying to understand our ontology</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:33.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I like what I advocated</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.720" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">earlier about you know the deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.490" end="00:12:37.570" style="s2">continuity hypothesis says don&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.430" style="s2">look upwards like when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.570" end="00:12:41.710" style="s2">understand like the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.430" end="00:12:44.500" style="s2">consciousness take the properties and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.710" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">make that inform how you look downward</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.500" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">again make that a grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.760" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">intelligibility how you look downward</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:51.880" style="s2">now you shouldn&#39;t simplistically then</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:53.860" style="s2">say oh well that means that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.880" end="00:12:57.100" style="s2">consciousness is down at the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.860" end="00:12:59.320" style="s2">level because that is to miss exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.100" end="00:13:02.170" style="s2">right what the power of the emergentist</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.320" end="00:13:05.410" style="s2">has said but you also should you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.170" end="00:13:07.210" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t think right that right that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.410" end="00:13:09.490" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of dualistic heaven</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.210" end="00:13:14.550" style="s2">that the emanation s wants you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.490" end="00:13:18.070" style="s2">land of the world of pure form and so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.550" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">as I said that second point I think is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.070" end="00:13:23.500" style="s2">something that we really I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:25.690" style="s2">wrestling with it in my mind it</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.500" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">intersects with this deeper attempt I</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.690" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">have to try to get and break through a</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:33.450" style="s2">lot of these dichotomies that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:37.430" style="s2">have us locked in</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.450" end="00:13:41.520" style="s2">an ineffective grammar of cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.430" end="00:13:44.490" style="s2">of our existential lives so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.520" end="00:13:47.400" style="s2">if right I do know that that is in no</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.490" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">way a complete yes a responsible answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.400" end="00:13:50.460" style="s2">but I&#39;m trying to show you what my</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.820" end="00:13:57.810" style="s2">we could do at the end which is just put</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.220" end="00:14:00.150" style="s2">our frames of where we&#39;re at with this</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.810" end="00:14:03.570" style="s2">stuff together it&#39;s obviously not so</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.150" end="00:14:05.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not not not not some God getting to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.570" end="00:14:09.840" style="s2">the acute end of this stuff is not is</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.700" end="00:14:11.790" style="s2">not easy um I wonder if one way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.840" end="00:14:14.550" style="s2">progress the conversation from here is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.790" end="00:14:17.700" style="s2">to talk about the role that you might</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.550" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">take cognitive cognitive agents to play</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.700" end="00:14:23.070" style="s2">or perhaps the role that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:26.400" style="s2">plays in the mediation of the potential</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.070" end="00:14:28.590" style="s2">of potential into the actual mm-hmm is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.400" end="00:14:30.810" style="s2">the dynamic something that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.590" end="00:14:36.740" style="s2">potentially one that can resolve this</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.810" end="00:14:41.310" style="s2">problem with emergence and emanation I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.740" end="00:14:42.810" style="s2">hope so I mean I I I would I mean I have</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.310" end="00:14:45.090" style="s2">argued that I&#39;ve published and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.810" end="00:14:48.960" style="s2">working on for a deep continuity between</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.090" end="00:14:50.910" style="s2">the machinery of consciousness as a form</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.960" end="00:14:53.460" style="s2">of relevance realization that is also</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.910" end="00:14:56.280" style="s2">generating perspectival knowing right</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.460" end="00:14:58.290" style="s2">and a salience landscaping and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.280" end="00:15:00.390" style="s2">what what consciousness does is it makes</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.290" end="00:15:02.730" style="s2">it gives us this textured salience</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.390" end="00:15:05.010" style="s2">landscape in which we&#39;re caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.730" end="00:15:08.640" style="s2">sort of you know fields of obvious Ness</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.010" end="00:15:10.230" style="s2">and so but I think that that at the core</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.640" end="00:15:12.180" style="s2">and I make the argument this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.230" end="00:15:13.830" style="s2">convergent with a lot of work at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.180" end="00:15:16.170" style="s2">core of that as machinery of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.830" end="00:15:17.790" style="s2">realization which I think ultimately is</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.170" end="00:15:20.640" style="s2">continuous with the machinery of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.790" end="00:15:22.380" style="s2">intelligence and and that&#39;s and you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.640" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">see that in how both consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.380" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">at least your fluid intelligence are</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:29.130" style="s2">deeply correlated with working memory</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:31.260" style="s2">right and so you can see working memory</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.130" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">is a place where you know you can if</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.260" end="00:15:34.440" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me I don&#39;t not happy with</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:36.060" style="s2">these metaphors but they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.440" end="00:15:38.130" style="s2">we&#39;re using you can sort of look up to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.060" end="00:15:39.960" style="s2">consciousness and you can look down to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.130" end="00:15:41.150" style="s2">the intelligence found in our cognition</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.960" end="00:15:44.310" style="s2">and then you can look through that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.150" end="00:15:46.889" style="s2">intelligence right also into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.310" end="00:15:49.410" style="s2">machinery of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.889" end="00:15:50.699" style="s2">logical existence here&#39;s why I argue</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.410" end="00:15:52.920" style="s2">explicitly that the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.699" end="00:15:55.290" style="s2">realization that is at the core of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.920" end="00:15:57.929" style="s2">intelligence is actually a function of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.290" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">the bio economy of your brain it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.929" end="00:16:02.939" style="s2">it&#39;s working in terms of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:04.589" style="s2">logistical properties of efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.939" end="00:16:07.410" style="s2">resiliency that you know are</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.589" end="00:16:10.499" style="s2">constitutive of any adaptive autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.410" end="00:16:13.319" style="s2">system and so that&#39;s what I mean I like</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.499" end="00:16:15.089" style="s2">when if I if I I would argue not</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.319" end="00:16:16.439" style="s2">everybody agrees with me of course so</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.089" end="00:16:18.179" style="s2">that would be really ridiculously</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.439" end="00:16:19.859" style="s2">pretentious but I would argue that if</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.179" end="00:16:22.529" style="s2">you look at consciousness the right way</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.859" end="00:16:24.749" style="s2">you can see continuity with intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.529" end="00:16:26.369" style="s2">and then that very way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.749" end="00:16:28.709" style="s2">intelligence allows you to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.369" end="00:16:32.119" style="s2">continuity down to life and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.709" end="00:16:34.649" style="s2">a very Aristotelian framework again yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.119" end="00:16:38.699" style="s2">well I think that&#39;s very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.649" end="00:16:42.209" style="s2">I can&#39;t participate in that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.699" end="00:16:44.429" style="s2">with the degree of acuity that you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.209" end="00:16:48.589" style="s2">for some of this although I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.429" end="00:16:48.589" style="s2">with you as far as the gestalt goes</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.689" end="00:16:54.679" style="s2">still seems seems to me that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.919" end="00:16:58.369" style="s2">something about the process of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.679" end="00:17:00.569" style="s2">transformation mm-hmm which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.369" end="00:17:05.089" style="s2">experienced experientially can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.569" end="00:17:09.389" style="s2">discerned and oriented in experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.089" end="00:17:14.789" style="s2">involves the the interplay of well</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.389" end="00:17:20.360" style="s2">coherence and incoherence sure and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.789" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that which which</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.360" end="00:17:27.569" style="s2">yes I can see being well it can see</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:30.019" style="s2">something&#39;s in some analogous way being</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.569" end="00:17:33.179" style="s2">the process which enables self making</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.019" end="00:17:35.130" style="s2">autopoietic systems you come into an</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.179" end="00:17:39.720" style="s2">appropriate fusion with anything at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.130" end="00:17:43.590" style="s2">so really what I&#39;m just looking to argue</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.720" end="00:17:46.590" style="s2">or get clear on is whether or not there</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.590" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">is like there has it seems to me there</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.590" end="00:17:52.710" style="s2">should be a fitted napot ins of engaging</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.100" end="00:17:55.740" style="s2">the consciousness that we have oh and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.710" end="00:17:58.200" style="s2">the and the processes which enable</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.740" end="00:17:59.909" style="s2">coherence to be a fact of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.200" end="00:18:00.600" style="s2">at all in what we might traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.909" end="00:18:03.960" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.600" end="00:18:05.580" style="s2">as non-conscious things I&#39;m not acting</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.960" end="00:18:07.500" style="s2">arguing for consciousness as we have it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.580" end="00:18:10.230" style="s2">at the bottom of things but just that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.500" end="00:18:13.820" style="s2">there is a kind of there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.230" end="00:18:16.620" style="s2">sentience awareness and implicit goal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.820" end="00:18:18.300" style="s2">formulation and goal actualization and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.620" end="00:18:20.760" style="s2">transformation occurring with</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.300" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">actualizing that goal which can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.760" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">understood in this some like some</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:27.570" style="s2">ontology of the actual and the potential</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:30.120" style="s2">and the mediation in-between and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.570" end="00:18:32.940" style="s2">you have this kind of you have an engine</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.120" end="00:18:35.910" style="s2">there of a becoming and a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.940" end="00:18:38.370" style="s2">towards growth will be uses that terms</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.910" end="00:18:41.720" style="s2">transcend and include there is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.370" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">of fusion that then baguettes a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.720" end="00:18:45.720" style="s2">different perspective it&#39;s nothing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:47.970" style="s2">become something else but it&#39;s embraced</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.720" end="00:18:49.170" style="s2">what was before and it&#39;s moving on and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.970" end="00:18:51.150" style="s2">developing and it is a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.170" end="00:18:54.870" style="s2">aggression into novelty in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.150" end="00:18:58.530" style="s2">and so it seems to like because I I</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.870" end="00:19:00.420" style="s2">think what&#39;s important to so people get</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.530" end="00:19:01.590" style="s2">stuck in a nihilistic worldview where</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.420" end="00:19:03.930" style="s2">there&#39;s no meaning to anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.590" end="00:19:06.060" style="s2">whatsoever right or they endorse some</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.930" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">ideology that that gives them meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.060" end="00:19:13.860" style="s2">right which might really just be some</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:15.570" style="s2">sort of power position sure but but what</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.860" end="00:19:19.710" style="s2">seems to me to be the case is that there</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:21.570" style="s2">is at the at the core of you can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.710" end="00:19:22.980" style="s2">destroyed in experience and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.570" end="00:19:24.420" style="s2">spoken about psychedelics this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.980" end="00:19:26.280" style="s2">something that&#39;s very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.420" end="00:19:30.390" style="s2">meditation of course you&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.280" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">the same machinery to you know um that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.390" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">there is a it&#39;s like to get the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:37.650" style="s2">process of this thing that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:41.220" style="s2">involved in this process that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.650" end="00:19:44.370" style="s2">inexorably unceasingly existentially</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.220" end="00:19:47.100" style="s2">trapped in or a part of and can</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.370" end="00:19:49.110" style="s2">transcend by embracing is like are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.100" end="00:19:50.910" style="s2">trapped in an ironic cycle of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.110" end="00:19:53.160" style="s2">or do you embrace it and affirm it with</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.910" end="00:19:55.620" style="s2">love at your core not just for self but</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.160" end="00:19:57.900" style="s2">for everything right because self is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.620" end="00:20:02.010" style="s2">everything in some important sense but</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.900" end="00:20:03.690" style="s2">so if a bit so if all is in koi for</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.010" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">there to be coherence between things</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.690" end="00:20:09.390" style="s2">there is a pattern of at least that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:11.340" style="s2">meta pattern of transformation that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.390" end="00:20:14.100" style="s2">participate in where there is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.340" end="00:20:16.770" style="s2">of connected becoming of love</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.100" end="00:20:18.330" style="s2">transformation like like that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.770" end="00:20:20.700" style="s2">to be a pattern for me that that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.330" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">make sense or it&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.700" end="00:20:25.590" style="s2">fit so I&#39;m drawn to say it that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:27.720" style="s2">something about how you can show up as</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.590" end="00:20:30.630" style="s2">you in an attempt to transform yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.720" end="00:20:33.960" style="s2">with love for like an affirmation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.630" end="00:20:37.470" style="s2">this cycle at your core that is is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.960" end="00:20:40.260" style="s2">something to draw on which which can</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.470" end="00:20:42.750" style="s2">transform anybody its how metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.260" end="00:20:44.970" style="s2">a part of the very transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.750" end="00:20:47.400" style="s2">being itself is that that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.970" end="00:20:49.799" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to how involved is the human</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.690" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">negotiate around it so I think trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.500" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">understand this as it is a teleological</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:12.150" style="s2">aspect of our metaphysics I think is is</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.150" end="00:22:17.549" style="s2">as probably mistaken because of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.660" end="00:22:37.250" style="s2">again go back to thinking of like I said</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.250" end="00:22:42.140" style="s2">in which like like my biological fitted</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.980" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">notion of affordance right the grass for</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.350" end="00:23:04.310" style="s2">and the glass and so I would think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.420" end="00:23:06.500" style="s2">this in terms of real affordances you</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.270" end="00:23:12.650" style="s2">we genuinely need to bring in</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.650" end="00:23:19.190" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.990" end="00:23:21.380" style="s2">and biological entities so I would I</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.190" end="00:23:25.730" style="s2">would say that and then what I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.380" end="00:23:28.130" style="s2">want to say and this is again I&#39;m more</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.950" end="00:23:39.830" style="s2">know and and a lot of Neoplatonism and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.850" end="00:23:41.570" style="s2">this idea you know that there there is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.830" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a structure of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.570" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">to the world but I want to separate that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:48.890" style="s2">from any from any sort of TD illogical</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:50.300" style="s2">movement or momentum but they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.890" end="00:23:53.620" style="s2">they&#39;re there is a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.300" end="00:23:57.410" style="s2">possibility and actuality are are</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.620" end="00:23:59.270" style="s2">organized that are deeply constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.410" end="00:24:01.970" style="s2">of what we take to be the realness of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.270" end="00:24:05.030" style="s2">things and so when I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.970" end="00:24:08.630" style="s2">intelligibility of the cup right of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.030" end="00:24:11.720" style="s2">glass you know and and this is where I I</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.630" end="00:24:13.910" style="s2">think I I&#39;m in agreement with you right</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.720" end="00:24:16.070" style="s2">I&#39;m talking not only about the structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.910" end="00:24:17.540" style="s2">by which it&#39;s no one I&#39;m also started</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.070" end="00:24:19.640" style="s2">talking about the structure by which it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.540" end="00:24:21.860" style="s2">is right and that there&#39;s a level at</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.640" end="00:24:25.010" style="s2">which the patterns of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.860" end="00:24:29.240" style="s2">and the patterns by which that thing it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.010" end="00:24:31.580" style="s2">is organized to be the thing it is are</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.240" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">get into some kind of conformity with</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.580" end="00:24:34.790" style="s2">each other now I don&#39;t mean that in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.140" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">old way that Aristotle meant but I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.790" end="00:24:36.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a newer way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:38.100" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.360" end="00:24:40.410" style="s2">which I&#39;m trying to articulate with you</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.100" end="00:24:45.630" style="s2">that I think does give us a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.410" end="00:24:47.190" style="s2">that when I am right experiencing a kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.630" end="00:24:50.270" style="s2">of you know sort of profound</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.190" end="00:24:52.980" style="s2">connectedness and deep coherence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.270" end="00:24:56.390" style="s2">intelligibility in my cognition that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.980" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">disclosing a kind of deep coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.390" end="00:25:02.520" style="s2">intelligible structure to the universe</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:04.920" style="s2">and that gives me a profound sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.520" end="00:25:07.140" style="s2">connectedness and meaning and I take</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.920" end="00:25:09.780" style="s2">both of those poles to be real things</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.140" end="00:25:12.169" style="s2">and the relation itself to be real so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.780" end="00:25:17.880" style="s2">take the whole process to be real yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.169" end="00:25:20.070" style="s2">yes I understand and I wonder if so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.880" end="00:25:22.860" style="s2">wonder if you thinking what I put</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.070" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">forward before that my notion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.860" end="00:25:29.100" style="s2">teleology is one that places a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:31.110" style="s2">goal into the equation because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.100" end="00:25:33.210" style="s2">think that&#39;s what I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.110" end="00:25:36.870" style="s2">endorse that there is an endpoint at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.210" end="00:25:40.620" style="s2">to this idea of teleology and if it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.870" end="00:25:46.380" style="s2">the so go ahead I know no I I guess for</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.620" end="00:25:48.090" style="s2">me I mean we have to we have to try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.380" end="00:25:50.490" style="s2">explicate the models we&#39;re using here</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.090" end="00:25:52.200" style="s2">and and and they&#39;re always there so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.490" end="00:25:54.570" style="s2">have the model of making like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.200" end="00:25:57.150" style="s2">generation of artifacts and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.570" end="00:25:59.700" style="s2">the the model of making that comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.150" end="00:26:03.000" style="s2">through something like evolution and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.700" end="00:26:05.460" style="s2">take it that the project of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.000" end="00:26:08.040" style="s2">use the first model has largely failed</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.460" end="00:26:09.270" style="s2">and that what we&#39;re talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.040" end="00:26:12.750" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the way the universe</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.270" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">is making creating bringing about</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.750" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">novelty you know sort of disclosing the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:21.030" style="s2">inexhaustibility of itself I take that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:23.549" style="s2">maybe when that that a better model I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.030" end="00:26:25.320" style="s2">not claiming identity but I think that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.549" end="00:26:28.169" style="s2">better model for that is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.320" end="00:26:30.390" style="s2">evolutionary model of of making rather</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.169" end="00:26:32.580" style="s2">than the artefactual model of making yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.390" end="00:26:34.110" style="s2">okay so where where I&#39;m at in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.580" end="00:26:38.610" style="s2">thinking what&#39;s being gripping me is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.110" end="00:26:41.880" style="s2">that is that what you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.610" end="00:26:44.040" style="s2">influenced by as far as I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.880" end="00:26:46.410" style="s2">the Union notion of the god image the</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.900" end="00:27:00.390" style="s2">also the the echo or the image that is</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.390" end="00:27:04.140" style="s2">that but this is just an this I mean and</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.530" end="00:27:34.770" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.100" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">I think precisely what for let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.770" end="00:27:38.669" style="s2">for example both the Neoplatonic and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:41.880" style="s2">and the vedanta you know traditions say</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.669" end="00:27:44.010" style="s2">is if you claim me in to write a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.880" end="00:27:46.620" style="s2">an autobiographical sense of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.010" end="00:27:49.080" style="s2">get who you are and sort of your goal</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.620" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">seeking your and the teleology of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.080" end="00:27:55.590" style="s2">existence you&#39;re actually gonna not come</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:58.470" style="s2">into contact with that one and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.590" end="00:28:00.660" style="s2">not good at meant is right it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.470" end="00:28:02.760" style="s2">identical but non do all with brahman</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.660" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">and i think that that&#39;s the same idea I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.760" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">think in some important ways I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:11.850" style="s2">keeping a simplistic perennialism but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:14.190" style="s2">think you&#39;re seeing a simple or our idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.850" end="00:28:17.370" style="s2">right in the neo platonic tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.190" end="00:28:20.490" style="s2">when I realize the one within when I get</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.370" end="00:28:23.309" style="s2">that sort of that dynamic ground that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.490" end="00:28:25.260" style="s2">washburn when I get at that sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.309" end="00:28:28.110" style="s2">that dynamic structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.260" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">organisation operating principles of who</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.110" end="00:28:33.870" style="s2">of my psyche in total that gives me a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:36.270" style="s2">participatory knowing I know of sort of</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.270" end="00:28:40.980" style="s2">know in the external world yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.429" end="00:28:42.870" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s deep right and it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.870" end="00:28:48.750" style="s2">angel are is that ultimately has to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.390" end="00:28:49.740" style="s2">the case and so if that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.750" end="00:28:52.770" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.740" end="00:28:53.309" style="s2">iiiiii yes I would I would say I would</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.180" end="00:29:14.830" style="s2">not that&#39;s what because I do think these</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:16.270" style="s2">were these three things line up I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.830" end="00:29:18.040" style="s2">the scientific worldview the neo</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.270" end="00:29:19.780" style="s2">platonic and the Vedanta both point</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.040" end="00:29:22.990" style="s2">towards no no that&#39;s what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.780" end="00:29:27.730" style="s2">let go in order to get to that level we</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.990" end="00:29:29.950" style="s2">find that that deep inner that eat deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.730" end="00:29:31.900" style="s2">inner penetration I mean it what happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.950" end="00:29:34.120" style="s2">I think and this is what I would make a</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.120" end="00:29:38.050" style="s2">get you get a kind of knowing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.370" end="00:29:39.880" style="s2">disclosed and it&#39;s it&#39;s where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.050" end="00:29:42.610" style="s2">got between knowing and being dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.880" end="00:29:45.670" style="s2">look III know I&#39;m conscious by being</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.610" end="00:29:47.020" style="s2">conscious to quote form it I know I</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.510" end="00:29:55.780" style="s2">I ask you of your conscious right now do</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.400" end="00:29:57.700" style="s2">you know you&#39;re conscious by being</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.780" end="00:30:00.610" style="s2">conscious and I think there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.700" end="00:30:02.860" style="s2">things we know by being them rather than</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.610" end="00:30:06.970" style="s2">thinking about them reflecting on them</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.860" end="00:30:10.630" style="s2">or dis forcing about them yes yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.970" end="00:30:12.280" style="s2">the the relationship between these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.630" end="00:30:16.060" style="s2">of knowing I think is absolutely crucial</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.280" end="00:30:18.250" style="s2">and there&#39;s more there&#39;s so much more I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.060" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">want to say and I think it would take</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.250" end="00:30:23.950" style="s2">yeah a lot more time to to get clear on</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:25.840" style="s2">where I&#39;m coming from because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.950" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">have the depth of learning that you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.840" end="00:30:34.140" style="s2">and I have I think I have in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:38.380" style="s2">a a frame that&#39;s been stretched to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.140" end="00:30:41.500" style="s2">important dimensions that allows me a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.380" end="00:30:44.950" style="s2">container to play in the space but mu</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.500" end="00:30:49.450" style="s2">you make caught you know to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.950" end="00:30:52.540" style="s2">sensible the different diamonds in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.450" end="00:30:56.440" style="s2">space is something that yes it takes me</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.540" end="00:30:58.450" style="s2">many many you know attempts at</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.440" end="00:31:01.690" style="s2">generating it and it would take us some</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.450" end="00:31:04.510" style="s2">time and I&#39;m conscious of two things one</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.690" end="00:31:06.100" style="s2">is that we have a poor connection thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.510" end="00:31:08.770" style="s2">here going on with Skype this last</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.100" end="00:31:10.510" style="s2">couple minutes I think it&#39;s you oh you</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.770" end="00:31:14.950" style="s2">had movements and energy if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.510" end="00:31:15.700" style="s2">interrupted their flow and the other one</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.950" end="00:31:19.330" style="s2">is that I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.700" end="00:31:21.309" style="s2">that we have about three minutes left so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.330" end="00:31:22.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to wrap something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.309" end="00:31:25.450" style="s2">this up because as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.990" end="00:31:27.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the beginning of a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.450" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">it&#39;s one I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.070" end="00:31:31.720" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;m happy I&#39;m happy to come back</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:34.360" style="s2">at some future date type someone I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.720" end="00:31:36.519" style="s2">love to I&#39;d love to and you know I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.360" end="00:31:40.929" style="s2">actually like to discuss with you and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.519" end="00:31:43.149" style="s2">and others how to make that time most</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.929" end="00:31:48.639" style="s2">effective partly because I have I have</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.149" end="00:31:50.169" style="s2">two drives well - yeah at least two</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.639" end="00:31:53.470" style="s2">drives with this kind of project right</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.169" end="00:31:55.659" style="s2">one is one is what we&#39;ve been doing for</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.470" end="00:31:57.909" style="s2">the last half an hour which is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.659" end="00:32:00.010" style="s2">genuinely explore at the limits of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.909" end="00:32:04.330" style="s2">own understanding and to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.010" end="00:32:07.990" style="s2">a conversation at that level and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.330" end="00:32:13.210" style="s2">there&#39;s value in that but I do I do too</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.990" end="00:32:15.100" style="s2">but but the other is to the other is to</p>
