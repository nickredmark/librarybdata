<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">jessica is a PhD in material science</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">from the University of Oxford as a</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:03.899" style="s2">something a little different here on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">Jim Rutte show with this episode in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.899" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">next couple episodes this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:11.610" style="s2">of a three episode arc this month</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">focusing on climate change we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.610" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">mostly about climate related things but</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">in addition to her work on climate</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">issues Jessica also does great work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">the nature and history of innovation we</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">posted a link to that work on the</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in those topics I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">recommend you check it out now to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">technology and the fight against climate</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">change let&#39;s start with some basics what</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">is er oai or energy return on energy</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">invested and why is it so important well</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:49.500" style="s2">so the EROI or the energy return on</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:53.790" style="s2">investment is just a simple measure of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.500" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">the energy you get back from building</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.790" end="00:01:59.750" style="s2">some energy conversion technology so</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">building any technology requires</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.750" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">especially Hardware requires some amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">of energy for production and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">manufacturing and then you get a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">amount of energy back when you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">not technology and the ratio of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:18.299" style="s2">two is the energy return on investment</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:21.079" style="s2">okay and why is that so important well</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.299" end="00:02:24.769" style="s2">it&#39;s important I would say especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.079" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">today when we&#39;re using fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.769" end="00:02:30.329" style="s2">primarily to manufacture many of the low</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:32.670" style="s2">carbon energy technologies that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.329" end="00:02:36.629" style="s2">may have heard of like solar energy and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.670" end="00:02:38.340" style="s2">energy panels and wind turbines so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.629" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">use typically fossil fuels to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.340" end="00:02:43.439" style="s2">manufacture those but then when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:45.299" style="s2">put into operation they generate a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.439" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">certain amount of electricity and we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.299" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">like to make sure that that amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:51.989" style="s2">electricity is more than the energy put</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:54.989" style="s2">in and the more the better right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.989" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">the more the better but I will say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.989" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">of course if we get to a regime where</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:03.659" style="s2">we&#39;re using renewable energy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">manufacture these technologies then we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.659" end="00:03:08.069" style="s2">won&#39;t be quite as concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:10.260" style="s2">energy return on investment because</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:12.419" style="s2">you&#39;re putting basically clean energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.260" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">into manufacturing the hardware and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.419" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">there you&#39;re using it to produce clean</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:19.709" style="s2">electricity in the case of solar and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:21.449" style="s2">wind energy so that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.709" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">important to keep in mind but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.449" end="00:03:27.030" style="s2">in this transition period you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">make sure that the solar panels and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.030" end="00:03:31.169" style="s2">know wind turbines you&#39;re building that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:33.569" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get more clean energy out</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.169" end="00:03:35.819" style="s2">than the fossil fuel energy you put in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.569" end="00:03:37.260" style="s2">okay very good it&#39;s a foundation which</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.819" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about in somewhat more detail</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.260" end="00:03:42.090" style="s2">later okay second foundational idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:44.069" style="s2">which will reference several times in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.090" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">the discussion coming is what is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.069" end="00:03:48.299" style="s2">learning curve and could you give us an</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:51.449" style="s2">example from something outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.299" end="00:03:53.849" style="s2">energy field yeah sure so the learning</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.449" end="00:03:56.310" style="s2">curve was first observed in airplane</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.849" end="00:03:59.239" style="s2">manufacturing where it was seen that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.310" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">labor hours or the labor productivity</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.239" end="00:04:05.729" style="s2">increased with the number of units</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:08.489" style="s2">produced and so this was named the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.729" end="00:04:10.470" style="s2">learning curve it was later applied to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.489" end="00:04:14.669" style="s2">many different technologies outside of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.470" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">airplanes and the basic idea in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.669" end="00:04:19.010" style="s2">the mathematics of the learning</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:22.580" style="s2">is that if you&#39;re following the typical</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.010" end="00:04:25.400" style="s2">learning curve for each 1% increase in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:28.280" style="s2">cumulative production you get a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.400" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">percentage improvement in performance</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:33.860" style="s2">and so that could be improvement in cost</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:35.660" style="s2">intensity of the technology or it could</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.860" end="00:04:38.510" style="s2">be improvement in some other measure of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.660" end="00:04:40.460" style="s2">performance but these are simple curves</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.510" end="00:04:42.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a simple model but it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.460" end="00:04:43.669" style="s2">useful for comparing the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.440" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">improvement across different</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.669" end="00:04:48.860" style="s2">technologies and we see that solar cells</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.810" style="s2">for example in solar panels have</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:53.690" style="s2">followed a learning curve wind turbines</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.810" end="00:04:57.139" style="s2">have as well and many technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.690" end="00:04:58.940" style="s2">within energy systems and outside of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.139" end="00:05:01.460" style="s2">energy systems have followed these</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.940" end="00:05:03.860" style="s2">learning curves one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.460" end="00:05:05.900" style="s2">aspects of this is to try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.860" end="00:05:08.510" style="s2">where this kind of behavior comes from</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.900" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">so there have been you know many</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.510" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">interesting questions and we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:15.169" style="s2">to get answers to them on why we see</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.220" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">these kinds of trends and technologies</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.169" end="00:05:20.090" style="s2">and also getting some insights on why</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:21.620" style="s2">some technologies improve faster than</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.090" end="00:05:24.710" style="s2">others which obviously is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.620" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">important for making good investments in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.710" end="00:05:28.850" style="s2">climate saving technology because we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:31.400" style="s2">really want to invest in those</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.850" end="00:05:33.560" style="s2">technologies that are going to improve</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.400" end="00:05:35.990" style="s2">quickly that are going to reach cost</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.560" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2">competitiveness that will you know their</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.990" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">performance will increase and and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.590" end="00:05:44.090" style="s2">that they&#39;ll be widely you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:46.250" style="s2">affordable and can be adopted around the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.090" end="00:05:49.370" style="s2">world yeah very good</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.250" end="00:05:51.470" style="s2">now one well-known statement of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.370" end="00:05:53.990" style="s2">learning curve is Moore&#39;s Law right</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.470" end="00:05:55.220" style="s2">that&#39;s stated in terms of time and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.990" end="00:05:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s also forget the name of the guy</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.220" end="00:05:59.930" style="s2">there somebody else is law where the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.280" end="00:06:01.190" style="s2">that&#39;s where it stayed in terms of units</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.930" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">can you talk a little bit about that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.190" end="00:06:05.180" style="s2">the difference between the two yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:07.550" style="s2">so there&#39;s something called rights</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.180" end="00:06:10.520" style="s2">rights curve or rights law and Moore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.550" end="00:06:13.130" style="s2">curve or Moore&#39;s law Moore&#39;s law which</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:15.880" style="s2">many people may be familiar with is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.130" end="00:06:18.260" style="s2">exponential trend so we see</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.880" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">exponentially improving performance with</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.260" end="00:06:24.830" style="s2">time in the case of solar panels we see</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">that the drop in cost was about 10% per</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.830" end="00:06:29.340" style="s2">year over the last 40 years and overall</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen a nine</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.340" end="00:06:34.620" style="s2">9% roughly a 99 percent decline in costs</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:36.750" style="s2">over the last 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.620" end="00:06:38.220" style="s2">so that&#39;s Moore&#39;s law and then if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.750" end="00:06:41.570" style="s2">look at Wright&#39;s curve our rates law</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.220" end="00:06:44.490" style="s2">this is the functional form that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.570" end="00:06:46.410" style="s2">describes what I was mentioning for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.490" end="00:06:49.070" style="s2">learning curve so this is a power law</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.410" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">relationship where we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.070" end="00:06:55.139" style="s2">improvement along and metrics such as</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:56.940" style="s2">cost with increasing effort and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.139" end="00:07:00.389" style="s2">usually measured as a cumulative</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.940" end="00:07:03.660" style="s2">production so in that case what we see</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.389" end="00:07:05.550" style="s2">is that with each 1% increase in</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.660" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">cumulative production you see a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.550" end="00:07:11.090" style="s2">percent decline in costs that if a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:14.930" style="s2">technology follows that kind of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.090" end="00:07:18.120" style="s2">then it&#39;s following what we would expect</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:20.490" style="s2">from Bright&#39;s law now the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.120" end="00:07:22.680" style="s2">thing is that when we look at solar</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.490" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">panels which I mentioned before they</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.680" end="00:07:28.169" style="s2">actually follow both Moore&#39;s Law and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:30.840" style="s2">rights law you know so on the face of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.169" end="00:07:32.940" style="s2">Moore&#39;s law implies something pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.840" end="00:07:35.550" style="s2">different from rights law if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.940" end="00:07:37.380" style="s2">use this to inform our decisions because</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.550" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">of course with Moore&#39;s law you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.380" end="00:07:42.870" style="s2">looking at the improvement as a function</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:46.650" style="s2">of time so is there any way in which you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.870" end="00:07:51.510" style="s2">can speed things up if you know we say</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.650" end="00:07:53.849" style="s2">that cost intensity or cost of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.510" end="00:07:56.729" style="s2">to make it concrete a solar panel is</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.849" end="00:07:58.470" style="s2">falling with time if you just look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.729" end="00:08:00.210" style="s2">that on the face of it it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.470" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing we can do to speed it up</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.210" end="00:08:04.860" style="s2">on the other hand rights law tells us</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:07.320" style="s2">something very different and that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.860" end="00:08:10.349" style="s2">that if we produce more things will</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.320" end="00:08:12.090" style="s2">improve more quickly so which one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.349" end="00:08:14.669" style="s2">these is correct well as I mentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.090" end="00:08:17.580" style="s2">minute ago we see that both holds for</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.669" end="00:08:20.130" style="s2">the case of solar panels and for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.580" end="00:08:20.910" style="s2">number of different technologies why is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.130" end="00:08:23.910" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.910" end="00:08:26.430" style="s2">well when we dug into this what we found</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.910" end="00:08:28.410" style="s2">was that there was another type of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.430" end="00:08:32.279" style="s2">behavior another trend that we had to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.410" end="00:08:35.789" style="s2">pay attention to and that was the trend</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.279" end="00:08:38.310" style="s2">describing how cumulative production of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.789" end="00:08:41.560" style="s2">solar panels is increasing with time and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.310" end="00:08:43.719" style="s2">we see that that production has grown</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.560" end="00:08:47.740" style="s2">roughly exponentially over the last 40</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.719" end="00:08:50.649" style="s2">years so that means that we take those</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.740" end="00:08:52.180" style="s2">two observations we see that costs are</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.649" end="00:08:54.430" style="s2">coming down exponentially with time</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.180" end="00:08:56.379" style="s2">following Moore&#39;s law and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.430" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">production is growing exponentially with</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.379" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">time if we take those two things</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:05.019" style="s2">together and we plot cost intensity</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:07.269" style="s2">against cumulative production we would</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.019" end="00:09:10.059" style="s2">in fact expect to get rights curve out</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.269" end="00:09:13.420" style="s2">or rights law out so that&#39;s the reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.059" end="00:09:15.160" style="s2">why both describe the behavior and solar</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.420" end="00:09:17.769" style="s2">panels and in fact when we look across</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.160" end="00:09:20.439" style="s2">many different technologies technologies</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.769" end="00:09:22.689" style="s2">that start out with rapidly growing</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.439" end="00:09:24.790" style="s2">production tend to continue to grow</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.689" end="00:09:27.459" style="s2">rapidly and technologies that start out</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.790" end="00:09:30.910" style="s2">with more slowly growing production tend</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.459" end="00:09:32.680" style="s2">to continue to grow more slowly now</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.910" end="00:09:35.139" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say that we can&#39;t speed</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.680" end="00:09:36.819" style="s2">things up and based on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.139" end="00:09:39.550" style="s2">research that I&#39;ve done over the years</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.819" end="00:09:41.589" style="s2">my expectation and we see this in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.550" end="00:09:43.720" style="s2">couple of cases where we you know where</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.589" end="00:09:46.750" style="s2">we see that technologies their</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.720" end="00:09:49.180" style="s2">production has grown at different rates</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.750" end="00:09:52.600" style="s2">over different periods of time then we</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.180" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">see a departure from Moore&#39;s law and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.600" end="00:09:57.430" style="s2">see some of these technologies following</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:09:59.829" style="s2">still following rights law so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.430" end="00:10:01.899" style="s2">the bottom line is that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.829" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">Moore&#39;s law to describe many</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.899" end="00:10:06.610" style="s2">technologies and if we just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:08.290" style="s2">leave things alone then technologies</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.610" end="00:10:10.120" style="s2">will tend to grow exponentially with</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.290" end="00:10:12.939" style="s2">time but there are certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.120" end="00:10:15.790" style="s2">government policy interventions that can</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.939" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">speed things up and then you can you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.790" end="00:10:19.509" style="s2">know depart from this time-based trend</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:21.579" style="s2">and you can actually make improvements</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.509" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">faster and that&#39;s really again really</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.579" end="00:10:28.029" style="s2">important for climate policy because</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:30.040" style="s2">it&#39;s important to make investments to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.029" end="00:10:31.769" style="s2">drive innovation and technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.040" end="00:10:34.120" style="s2">can help us solve the climate problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.769" end="00:10:36.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about those policy</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.120" end="00:10:38.259" style="s2">settings a little bit later but good</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.040" end="00:10:40.749" style="s2">setting of the groundwork now from your</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.259" end="00:10:44.649" style="s2">work and also other work I&#39;ve looked at</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.749" end="00:10:46.809" style="s2">it seems like implicitly most people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.649" end="00:10:48.610" style="s2">have looked seriously at the technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.809" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">curves and how to really do this are</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.610" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">assuming that something close to an all</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.920" style="s2">electrical society is where we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:58.070" style="s2">do you see that as feasible</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.920" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">I would say yes we can get close to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.070" end="00:11:03.860" style="s2">there are still some energy services</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:05.959" style="s2">we&#39;re using electricity is difficult so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.860" end="00:11:09.410" style="s2">we see that in you know steel</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.959" end="00:11:11.930" style="s2">manufacturing or cement production some</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.410" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">of these energy services and industrial</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.930" end="00:11:18.740" style="s2">applications may require other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:20.510" style="s2">fuels or we may use electricity to split</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.740" end="00:11:23.420" style="s2">water for example or create other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.510" end="00:11:25.570" style="s2">of fuels that can be used in some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.420" end="00:11:29.750" style="s2">these applications but yeah on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.570" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">we are seeing this happening already so</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.750" end="00:11:37.730" style="s2">you do see more energy services becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:42.290" style="s2">electrified more heating is being</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.730" end="00:11:44.649" style="s2">produced using electricity and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.290" end="00:11:47.630" style="s2">this is important and the reason is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.649" end="00:11:51.579" style="s2">we do have ways we have pretty good ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.630" end="00:11:53.930" style="s2">now to produce electricity using</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.579" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">low-carbon technologies you know to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.930" end="00:11:58.940" style="s2">basically move away from using fossil</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:02.269" style="s2">fuels for electricity production so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.940" end="00:12:04.070" style="s2">we can use that electricity not only for</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.269" end="00:12:05.480" style="s2">you know lighting and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.070" end="00:12:07.490" style="s2">applications that we&#39;ve traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.480" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">used electricity for but also for</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.490" end="00:12:14.060" style="s2">transportation and also for heating and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:16.220" style="s2">for industrial processes the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.060" end="00:12:18.769" style="s2">do that the better but I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.220" end="00:12:20.300" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t assume that we can get a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.769" end="00:12:22.339" style="s2">hundred percent of the way there with</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.300" end="00:12:25.220" style="s2">electrification so one really important</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.339" end="00:12:28.550" style="s2">research area is to think about how we</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.220" end="00:12:34.190" style="s2">can combine electrification using more</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.550" end="00:12:36.440" style="s2">electricity with low-carbon sources with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.190" end="00:12:39.860" style="s2">the production of new kinds of fuels</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.440" end="00:12:41.779" style="s2">that can serve some of those heavy</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.860" end="00:12:44.839" style="s2">energy those high temperature</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.779" end="00:12:46.329" style="s2">applications or for example what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.839" end="00:12:49.100" style="s2">called long distance long-haul</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.329" end="00:12:51.800" style="s2">transportation that just means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.100" end="00:12:54.949" style="s2">going you know a vehicle is covering a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.800" end="00:12:57.740" style="s2">large distance and may be carrying a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.949" end="00:13:00.769" style="s2">large mass then we may need to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.740" end="00:13:02.329" style="s2">other sorts of options other than using</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.769" end="00:13:04.579" style="s2">the electricity directly but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.329" end="00:13:07.429" style="s2">certainly electrification is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.579" end="00:13:09.470" style="s2">important step toward addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.429" end="00:13:11.509" style="s2">climate problem okay I think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.470" end="00:13:13.369" style="s2">focus mostly on electricity though I</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.509" end="00:13:15.019" style="s2">would also point out that fairly</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.369" end="00:13:17.929" style="s2">recently there was a lot of interest in</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.019" end="00:13:19.819" style="s2">biofuels and also one of my favorites</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.929" end="00:13:22.790" style="s2">fact I actually did some experimental</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.819" end="00:13:24.679" style="s2">manufacture of thermosolar where you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.790" end="00:13:27.290" style="s2">heat your house and hot water directly</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.679" end="00:13:29.809" style="s2">with thermal energy at high much higher</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.290" end="00:13:31.819" style="s2">levels of efficiency than you get out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.809" end="00:13:34.249" style="s2">PV yeah and I hope people don&#39;t forget</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.819" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">those as well but let&#39;s mostly focus on</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.249" end="00:13:38.869" style="s2">electricity because if we&#39;re gonna truly</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">reform our whole society that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.869" end="00:13:43.309" style="s2">going to be the main road so one more</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:46.519" style="s2">fundamental before we start getting into</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.309" end="00:13:48.559" style="s2">some of the details if you could talk to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.519" end="00:13:50.839" style="s2">our audience a bit about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.559" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">in the electricity range between base</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.839" end="00:13:56.299" style="s2">load and intermittent sources and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:14:00.709" style="s2">even the concept of dispatch ability</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.299" end="00:14:02.089" style="s2">yeah sure so if we look at the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.709" end="00:14:04.850" style="s2">which different power plants are</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.089" end="00:14:06.410" style="s2">operating today to meet our demand for</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.850" end="00:14:08.389" style="s2">electricity so our demand for</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.410" end="00:14:11.269" style="s2">electricity and for example the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.389" end="00:14:12.529" style="s2">Northeast where I am right now you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.269" end="00:14:14.749" style="s2">that some of these plants are operating</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.529" end="00:14:17.239" style="s2">all of the time and those are our base</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.749" end="00:14:19.339" style="s2">load plants some of them are operating</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.239" end="00:14:22.509" style="s2">you know good fraction of the time maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.339" end="00:14:25.730" style="s2">50 percent of the time and others are</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.509" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">operating only for you know 10 percent</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.730" end="00:14:31.129" style="s2">of the time or much less and those would</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:32.569" style="s2">be peaker plants so we have the base</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.129" end="00:14:34.819" style="s2">load plants we have the intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.569" end="00:14:37.579" style="s2">plants and we have the peaker plants and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.819" end="00:14:39.019" style="s2">so the basic point is that many of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.579" end="00:14:42.290" style="s2">power plants are turning on and off</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.019" end="00:14:44.629" style="s2">that&#39;s because our demand peaks at</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.290" end="00:14:46.879" style="s2">different times of the day so it rises</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.629" end="00:14:49.819" style="s2">and falls depending on human activities</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.879" end="00:14:52.220" style="s2">we have the diurnal cycle you know most</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.819" end="00:14:54.369" style="s2">people wake up in the morning and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.220" end="00:14:57.319" style="s2">may go to work they may pursue other</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.369" end="00:14:59.449" style="s2">activities that consume energy and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.319" end="00:15:01.629" style="s2">at some point they&#39;re sleeping so our</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.449" end="00:15:04.009" style="s2">energy consumption tends to go down</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.629" end="00:15:06.470" style="s2">although there are some processes of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.009" end="00:15:08.179" style="s2">course that run through the night but</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.470" end="00:15:11.089" style="s2">anyway we have this fluctuating demand</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.179" end="00:15:14.689" style="s2">for electricity and these power plants</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.089" end="00:15:16.279" style="s2">turning on and off so in a sense many</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.689" end="00:15:18.589" style="s2">power plants are</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.279" end="00:15:20.329" style="s2">intermittent and how they&#39;re operated</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.589" end="00:15:22.879" style="s2">but when we bring in what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.329" end="00:15:25.850" style="s2">variable renewable energy which is solar</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.879" end="00:15:27.980" style="s2">and wind energy there there is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.850" end="00:15:31.009" style="s2">difference there&#39;s kind of a qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.980" end="00:15:32.689" style="s2">difference between those plants and some</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.009" end="00:15:35.449" style="s2">of the fossil fuel-fired plants that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.689" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">rely on today as well as nuclear which</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.449" end="00:15:41.240" style="s2">is that we are not in control of when</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:43.579" style="s2">the sun shining and the winds blowing so</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.240" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">they turn on and off but not in a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.579" end="00:15:48.259" style="s2">that&#39;s under our control however there</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:50.180" style="s2">are different approaches to dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.259" end="00:15:53.930" style="s2">that so I&#39;ll highlight three main</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.180" end="00:15:55.850" style="s2">approaches one is to use this variable</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.930" end="00:15:58.910" style="s2">renewable energy solar and wind energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.850" end="00:16:02.149" style="s2">with energy storage devices like</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.910" end="00:16:04.009" style="s2">batteries to store the energy when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.149" end="00:16:04.579" style="s2">have too much of it and then use it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.009" end="00:16:07.399" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.579" end="00:16:10.670" style="s2">another approach to dealing with this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.399" end="00:16:13.180" style="s2">variability is to draw your resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.670" end="00:16:16.009" style="s2">from a large geographical area that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.180" end="00:16:17.990" style="s2">tends to smooth out at least some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.009" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">these fluctuations and then a third</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.990" end="00:16:22.670" style="s2">approach is to use what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:25.670" style="s2">demand-side management or create a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.670" end="00:16:28.279" style="s2">flexible demand where you&#39;re matching</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.670" end="00:16:30.889" style="s2">the demand to the supply so you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.279" end="00:16:33.319" style="s2">imagine that there are many appliances</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.889" end="00:16:35.089" style="s2">and industrial processes that where</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.319" end="00:16:37.670" style="s2">there&#39;s some flexibility you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.089" end="00:16:40.220" style="s2">to run them at exactly you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:43.939" style="s2">point in time at which you turn on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.220" end="00:16:46.670" style="s2">dishwasher for example so if you need</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.939" end="00:16:49.339" style="s2">the clean dishes maybe the next morning</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.670" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">there is some flexibility there and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.339" end="00:16:53.449" style="s2">the dishwasher could turn on when</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:54.889" style="s2">there&#39;s an excess of electricity of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.449" end="00:16:56.600" style="s2">course if it&#39;s overnight that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.889" end="00:16:58.879" style="s2">help for solar and wind but that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.600" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">an example we can have you know heating</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.879" end="00:17:03.800" style="s2">and cooling that can go up and down by a</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:05.659" style="s2">few degrees that&#39;s imperceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.800" end="00:17:08.329" style="s2">people people can&#39;t perceive those</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.659" end="00:17:09.890" style="s2">differences but it could save large</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.329" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">amounts of energy so that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.890" end="00:17:14.870" style="s2">example of demand-side management yes so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:17.089" style="s2">those are called excellent big picture</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.870" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">ideas and it&#39;s you know I did a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.089" end="00:17:21.559" style="s2">dive into mass electrical storage which</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:24.620" style="s2">is a topic we&#39;re going to go into next</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.559" end="00:17:26.390" style="s2">and my first takeaway is kind of the AHA</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.620" end="00:17:28.880" style="s2">was this why is electricity different</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.390" end="00:17:29.870" style="s2">than any other product and that is if</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.880" end="00:17:32.450" style="s2">you ignore storage</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.870" end="00:17:35.480" style="s2">it has a useful life of one microsecond</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.450" end="00:17:37.940" style="s2">missus only right so that the supply and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.480" end="00:17:40.010" style="s2">demand has to be intricately balanced</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.940" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">and a surprising amount of electricity</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.010" end="00:17:43.910" style="s2">is actually discharged into the ground</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.960" end="00:17:46.280" style="s2">like more or less like a local lightning</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.910" end="00:17:48.680" style="s2">bolt when you know but frankly most all</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.280" end="00:17:50.510" style="s2">the time the balance isn&#39;t perfect but</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.680" end="00:17:52.850" style="s2">the the dance of the grid is to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.510" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">as close as possible and so when one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.850" end="00:17:56.330" style="s2">thinking about electricity it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:17:58.220" style="s2">different that almost anything else we</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.330" end="00:17:59.990" style="s2">deal with conceptually in the economy</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.220" end="00:18:02.840" style="s2">and that it has this you know one</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.990" end="00:18:04.040" style="s2">microsecond useful life which is you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.840" end="00:18:05.780" style="s2">know a good jump until one of my</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.040" end="00:18:08.840" style="s2">favorite topics when I spent six months</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.780" end="00:18:12.230" style="s2">working on back in 2004 which is mass</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.840" end="00:18:13.910" style="s2">storage of electricity and I know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.230" end="00:18:16.010" style="s2">written on this and you know why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.910" end="00:18:17.780" style="s2">important particularly when it&#39;s coupled</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.010" end="00:18:19.250" style="s2">to these variable sources because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.780" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">talk a little bit about that and how it</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.250" end="00:18:23.150" style="s2">fundamentally if you have enough of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">changes the whole nature of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.150" end="00:18:28.429" style="s2">variable production could mean yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:30.260" style="s2">so I mean just to start out I guess one</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.429" end="00:18:32.660" style="s2">way we can think about this if every</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.260" end="00:18:35.540" style="s2">time we build a solar power plant or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:39.800" style="s2">wind power plant we have some means of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.540" end="00:18:42.140" style="s2">storing that energy so we convert it to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.800" end="00:18:44.090" style="s2">electricity and then we store it in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.140" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">form and then we use it later as</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.090" end="00:18:49.130" style="s2">electricity if we can do that then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:52.100" style="s2">know these plants can be turned on and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.130" end="00:18:53.990" style="s2">off at will so that&#39;s really the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.100" end="00:18:56.929" style="s2">behind energy storage for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.990" end="00:18:59.450" style="s2">application for the power sector and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.929" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">there are a number of different ways in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.450" end="00:19:03.559" style="s2">which you can store energy and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.960" style="s2">sometimes say that the technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.559" end="00:19:09.230" style="s2">we have available for storing energy are</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.960" end="00:19:10.970" style="s2">as diverse or even more so than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.230" end="00:19:13.429" style="s2">technologies that we have available for</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.970" end="00:19:15.559" style="s2">converting energy you know to produce</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.429" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">electricity for example because you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.559" end="00:19:21.559" style="s2">imagine that you can store energy in all</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:24.530" style="s2">sorts of different forms and you know so</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.559" end="00:19:26.809" style="s2">we can use Pumped hydro storage we could</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.530" end="00:19:28.070" style="s2">use compressed air energy storage we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.809" end="00:19:30.110" style="s2">use various what are called</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.070" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">electrochemical devices so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.110" end="00:19:35.330" style="s2">batteries that we&#39;re familiar with like</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:38.060" style="s2">lithium-ion batteries and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.330" end="00:19:39.860" style="s2">batteries and so there are many</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.060" end="00:19:41.630" style="s2">different ways in which we can store</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.860" end="00:19:44.029" style="s2">energy and I would say that we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.630" end="00:19:46.789" style="s2">starting to really</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.029" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">explore what&#39;s called stationary energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.789" end="00:19:52.070" style="s2">storage technologies in a serious way</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:54.139" style="s2">and you might ask okay so why are why</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.070" end="00:19:56.539" style="s2">have we not explored these previously</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.139" end="00:19:59.659" style="s2">well there hasn&#39;t really been a market</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.539" end="00:20:02.269" style="s2">for it because fossil fuels are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.659" end="00:20:03.859" style="s2">cheap and they&#39;re pretty easy at a store</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.269" end="00:20:08.239" style="s2">and so there hasn&#39;t been a real</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.859" end="00:20:09.979" style="s2">incentive to develop alternatives now we</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.239" end="00:20:11.960" style="s2">have of course developed batteries for</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.979" end="00:20:14.570" style="s2">mobile applications so those are</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.960" end="00:20:17.359" style="s2">batteries that could be used you know in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.570" end="00:20:19.309" style="s2">our computers or our cell phones but</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.359" end="00:20:21.619" style="s2">once we start looking at these power</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.309" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">plants we need to be able to store it</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.619" end="00:20:27.859" style="s2">many more kilowatt hours we need a much</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:32.179" style="s2">larger energy capacity to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.859" end="00:20:34.070" style="s2">shift things around in time and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.179" end="00:20:35.899" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s something that there</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.070" end="00:20:38.059" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been as much of a demand for but</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.899" end="00:20:40.849" style="s2">now as the use of solar and wind energy</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.059" end="00:20:43.429" style="s2">is growing and as concerns about climate</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.849" end="00:20:45.589" style="s2">change are growing there&#39;s a real need</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.429" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">for this and so I expect that we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.589" end="00:20:51.229" style="s2">a lot of developments in this area of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:54.830" style="s2">course the outcome of those is still</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.229" end="00:20:57.559" style="s2">uncertain but it&#39;s an area that has a</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.830" end="00:20:59.690" style="s2">lot of potential I&#39;d say you know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.559" end="00:21:01.669" style="s2">looked into it back in 2004 the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.690" end="00:21:04.969" style="s2">technology I focused on was vanadium</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.669" end="00:21:06.919" style="s2">redox flow batteries these big sulfuric</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.969" end="00:21:09.619" style="s2">acid filled tanks with vanadium in at</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.919" end="00:21:12.049" style="s2">met cetera and that point in time it</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.619" end="00:21:14.749" style="s2">looked like it cost about $200 a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.049" end="00:21:16.849" style="s2">kilowatt hour for mass storage you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.749" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">eight hour deep storage 20 hour deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.849" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">storage you know really deep storage and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:24.440" style="s2">my analysis said that was not nearly</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:26.869" style="s2">good enough even for a very specialized</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.440" end="00:21:29.239" style="s2">case I was looking at for as a possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.869" end="00:21:30.889" style="s2">business venture and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.239" end="00:21:33.049" style="s2">consulted it was one of the best electro</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.889" end="00:21:34.999" style="s2">chemical engineers in the world who</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.049" end="00:21:37.609" style="s2">unfortunately has since passed away and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.999" end="00:21:39.259" style="s2">he said young man he was like 91 quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.609" end="00:21:42.349" style="s2">that old he was old young man you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.259" end="00:21:44.359" style="s2">used to the technology world where</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.349" end="00:21:46.369" style="s2">things double every two or three years</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.359" end="00:21:48.639" style="s2">in electrochemistry it doubles them out</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.369" end="00:21:51.529" style="s2">every 20 years if we&#39;re lucky and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.639" end="00:21:54.229" style="s2">interestingly he was damn close to right</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.529" end="00:21:56.869" style="s2">you know honest $200 for Kurla watt hour</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.229" end="00:21:57.650" style="s2">to her you know around $100 per kilowatt</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.869" end="00:21:59.930" style="s2">hour six</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.650" end="00:22:01.820" style="s2">years later I think you actually wrote</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.930" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">in a paper that you did recently that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.820" end="00:22:06.560" style="s2">something around $20 per kilowatt hours</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:08.360" style="s2">what we need to really be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.560" end="00:22:10.430" style="s2">intermittent sources competitive with</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.360" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">baseload sources that is that the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.430" end="00:22:15.380" style="s2">range yeah so that was one target but</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:17.450" style="s2">actually there&#39;s another way to solve</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.380" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">the intermittency problem which I which</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.450" end="00:22:22.610" style="s2">I can talk about as well but yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:26.450" style="s2">we did was to look at combining solar</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.610" end="00:22:29.300" style="s2">and wind and using solar and wind to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.450" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">reliably meet energy demand over a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.300" end="00:22:35.660" style="s2">period of twenty years so we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:37.790" style="s2">meet demand every hour over a period of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.660" end="00:22:39.950" style="s2">twenty years and so we want and then we</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.790" end="00:22:43.010" style="s2">asked how much storage would be needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.950" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">for that and we developed an</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.010" end="00:22:47.570" style="s2">optimization model so that we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:51.350" style="s2">only as much storage as we need and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.570" end="00:22:53.210" style="s2">we asked at what cost would these plants</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.350" end="00:22:55.850" style="s2">the solar and wind plants that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.210" end="00:22:58.040" style="s2">optimally combined with each other with</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.850" end="00:23:00.020" style="s2">this optimally sized energy storage at</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.040" end="00:23:02.690" style="s2">what point does that technology become</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.020" end="00:23:05.570" style="s2">competitive with other sources of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.690" end="00:23:09.890" style="s2">electricity and so the rough target that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.570" end="00:23:12.950" style="s2">we arrived at was twenty dollars per</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.890" end="00:23:15.980" style="s2">kilowatt hour energy capacity cost so</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.950" end="00:23:18.860" style="s2">for your listeners just a quick note</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.980" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">this is not to be confused with the cost</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.860" end="00:23:24.170" style="s2">of electricity this is instead the cost</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.710" end="00:23:27.170" style="s2">of building the capacity to store energy</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.170" end="00:23:30.200" style="s2">so this is the upfront costs what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.170" end="00:23:33.710" style="s2">would put into building your storage</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.200" end="00:23:36.290" style="s2">facility as compared to the electricity</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.710" end="00:23:38.630" style="s2">costs which is per unit electricity</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.290" end="00:23:40.340" style="s2">produced so anyway but that estimate</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.630" end="00:23:43.250" style="s2">that we arrived at was twenty dollars</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.340" end="00:23:45.710" style="s2">per kilowatt hour but this was to meet</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.250" end="00:23:50.030" style="s2">demand a hundred percent of the time if</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.710" end="00:23:51.410" style="s2">instead we relaxed that requirement and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.030" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">we say that we&#39;re going to use something</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.410" end="00:23:59.680" style="s2">else for just five percent of the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:24:02.660" style="s2">then what we see is that the target</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.680" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">rises to one hundred and fifty dollars</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.660" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">per kilowatt hour yeah we&#39;re there well</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:10.300" style="s2">yes and no I mean so those numbers that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:12.940" style="s2">we see publish for</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.300" end="00:24:15.550" style="s2">Kamiya and batteries are not taking into</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.940" end="00:24:17.770" style="s2">account we think the full cost of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.550" end="00:24:19.510" style="s2">installing a stationary energy storage</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.770" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">facility but you&#39;re right were close to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.510" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">there but then that that scenario is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:28.590" style="s2">also not that necessarily that easy to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">implement because we have to then find</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.590" end="00:24:34.630" style="s2">the other thing that we can use for five</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:36.910" style="s2">to ten percent of the time and so that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.630" end="00:24:40.200" style="s2">think is a really important research</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.910" end="00:24:44.470" style="s2">area it&#39;s one that we&#39;re looking at and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.200" end="00:24:46.750" style="s2">essentially I see us as you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.470" end="00:24:48.730" style="s2">can we should certainly continue to try</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.750" end="00:24:50.560" style="s2">to drive down the cost of energy storage</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.730" end="00:24:53.980" style="s2">but we should be looking for these other</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.560" end="00:24:56.050" style="s2">solutions and it could be producing low</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.980" end="00:24:58.030" style="s2">carbon fuels with the excess solar and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.050" end="00:24:59.710" style="s2">wind energy that you have because we see</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.030" end="00:25:02.050" style="s2">that when we optimize the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.710" end="00:25:03.880" style="s2">you&#39;re creating a lot of excess to learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.050" end="00:25:07.000" style="s2">wind energy so you could create other</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.880" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">revenue with that there are ways to and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.000" end="00:25:09.640" style="s2">this is something I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:11.290" style="s2">developing technology for a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.640" end="00:25:13.570" style="s2">kind of demand side management that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.290" end="00:25:16.540" style="s2">could help to serve that five to ten</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.570" end="00:25:18.700" style="s2">percent of additional demand so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.540" end="00:25:21.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a scenario that I call the energy</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.700" end="00:25:23.920" style="s2">storage plus scenario so it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.580" end="00:25:28.390" style="s2">hardware for energy storage but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.920" end="00:25:31.180" style="s2">also using software and developing</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.390" end="00:25:33.370" style="s2">approaches and algorithms as well as</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.180" end="00:25:37.150" style="s2">maybe producing some low carbon fuels</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.370" end="00:25:40.570" style="s2">that can fill in that additional five to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.150" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">ten percent of energy demand and so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.570" end="00:25:45.670" style="s2">reason why you see that big jump from</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:47.620" style="s2">$20 per kilowatt hour to $150 per</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.670" end="00:25:50.200" style="s2">kilowatt hour is that what we uncovered</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.620" end="00:25:53.710" style="s2">when we looked at 20 years of data on</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.200" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">the solar and wind energy resource and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.710" end="00:25:57.580" style="s2">bunch of different locations is that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:01.630" style="s2">all of these locations you have a small</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.580" end="00:26:04.900" style="s2">number of very large resource shortage</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.630" end="00:26:07.410" style="s2">events so you know overall over the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.900" end="00:26:09.460" style="s2">20-year period we have these</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.410" end="00:26:12.550" style="s2">fluctuations and the solar and wind</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.460" end="00:26:14.890" style="s2">energy resource but maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.550" end="00:26:17.950" style="s2">handful of times maybe five times over</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.890" end="00:26:19.600" style="s2">20 years you have larger fluctuations</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.950" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">where the amount of solar energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:23.680" style="s2">available drops significantly or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:26.980" style="s2">of wind energy available drop</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.680" end="00:26:29.470" style="s2">significantly so these rare but it</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.980" end="00:26:32.110" style="s2">rather extreme events are ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.470" end="00:26:34.570" style="s2">need to be able to deal with with energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.110" end="00:26:36.520" style="s2">storage and batteries and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.570" end="00:26:37.960" style="s2">energy storage technologies as well as</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.520" end="00:26:40.030" style="s2">some of the other approaches that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.960" end="00:26:43.720" style="s2">mentioned so that&#39;s kind of a big focus</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.030" end="00:26:47.290" style="s2">of mine and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.720" end="00:26:50.020" style="s2">you know an area that people are looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.290" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">into to look for solutions to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.020" end="00:26:54.190" style="s2">problem of course with a new problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:58.420" style="s2">requiring new technology or new</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.190" end="00:27:00.160" style="s2">approaches there&#39;s an opportunity there</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.420" end="00:27:03.190" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a big opportunity in</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.160" end="00:27:04.630" style="s2">that area I&#39;m gonna throw one out just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.190" end="00:27:06.580" style="s2">radical idea I&#39;m just thinking out loud</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.630" end="00:27:08.740" style="s2">and probably but whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.580" end="00:27:10.750" style="s2">suppose we made a major social change</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.740" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">which said that we&#39;re gonna have 15</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.750" end="00:27:15.610" style="s2">floating holidays on average which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:17.410" style="s2">gonna be on days where energy production</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.610" end="00:27:20.500" style="s2">isn&#39;t real high everybody just stay home</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.410" end="00:27:22.300" style="s2">read books yeah play games right it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.500" end="00:27:24.460" style="s2">could do a social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.300" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">change exactly we say all right you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.460" end="00:27:27.370" style="s2">here we got 48 hours notice this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:28.870" style="s2">probably going to be a day where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.370" end="00:27:32.020" style="s2">way better for everybody just stay home</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.870" end="00:27:34.840" style="s2">yeah and on average was 5% of the time</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.020" end="00:27:36.610" style="s2">that&#39;s you know 15 16 days a year</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.840" end="00:27:38.050" style="s2">the world would not end if people stayed</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.610" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">home 16 days a year</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.050" end="00:27:42.370" style="s2">no exactly and I think those are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:44.740" style="s2">kinds of creative ideas that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.370" end="00:27:46.150" style="s2">be thinking about and in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.740" end="00:27:48.220" style="s2">work when I&#39;m thinking about technology</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.150" end="00:27:50.980" style="s2">I&#39;m using a very broad definition and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.220" end="00:27:54.160" style="s2">it&#39;s inspired by the philosopher Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.980" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">Mumford and that definition covers not</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.160" end="00:28:00.430" style="s2">just hardware but also software</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:03.610" style="s2">institutional design really any codified</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.430" end="00:28:07.180" style="s2">knowledge that you know can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.610" end="00:28:09.250" style="s2">produce some sort of service so this</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.180" end="00:28:12.520" style="s2">definition of technology that I use is</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.250" end="00:28:13.810" style="s2">anything that transforms raw materials</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.520" end="00:28:16.510" style="s2">that we have here on earth including</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.810" end="00:28:19.270" style="s2">biological and geological materials into</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.510" end="00:28:21.070" style="s2">some more useful form so you know those</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.270" end="00:28:23.710" style="s2">biological materials include the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.070" end="00:28:26.200" style="s2">information processing capabilities of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.710" end="00:28:29.080" style="s2">the human brain and we can use software</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.200" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">and computers to augment that and to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.080" end="00:28:33.130" style="s2">new things so that definition of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:34.850" style="s2">technology is very broad and to solve</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.130" end="00:28:36.320" style="s2">this problem we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.850" end="00:28:38.990" style="s2">I think we want to be thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.320" end="00:28:41.210" style="s2">to combine hardware and software and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.990" end="00:28:44.120" style="s2">other what I call soft technologies</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.210" end="00:28:45.860" style="s2">that&#39;s non hardware technology to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.120" end="00:28:47.690" style="s2">solving this problem so social</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.860" end="00:28:50.990" style="s2">innovations like the one that you talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.690" end="00:28:52.550" style="s2">about would fall under that category and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.990" end="00:28:55.430" style="s2">of course we&#39;d have to test out these</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.550" end="00:28:57.830" style="s2">ideas we&#39;d have to you know see what</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.430" end="00:28:59.690" style="s2">people might accept but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.830" end="00:29:02.050" style="s2">there&#39;s so much we can do in this area</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.690" end="00:29:04.250" style="s2">and especially with the growth of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.050" end="00:29:06.320" style="s2">artificial intelligence which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.250" end="00:29:09.940" style="s2">broad term but in fact the practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">already in place of accessing data and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.940" end="00:29:14.300" style="s2">understanding preferences and behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:16.550" style="s2">I think we could put that to work to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.300" end="00:29:18.200" style="s2">solving these kinds of problems and for</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.550" end="00:29:19.670" style="s2">like social hacks we can use agent-based</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.200" end="00:29:21.770" style="s2">modeling to get at least their rough</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.670" end="00:29:24.140" style="s2">idea whether it&#39;s feasible or not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.770" end="00:29:25.610" style="s2">sure and of course with those models we</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.140" end="00:29:27.410" style="s2">always want to make sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.610" end="00:29:30.380" style="s2">decision rules and the agent behavior</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.410" end="00:29:32.660" style="s2">were modeling is somehow accurate but</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.380" end="00:29:34.940" style="s2">yeah we can run surveys we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.660" end="00:29:37.970" style="s2">out what people are willing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.940" end="00:29:40.460" style="s2">and I think we could get quite far with</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.970" end="00:29:42.260" style="s2">that all right now let&#39;s ratchet in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.460" end="00:29:44.390" style="s2">little bit a little bit more details I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.260" end="00:29:46.550" style="s2">gonna run across a number of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.390" end="00:29:50.210" style="s2">technologies basically SolarWinds</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.550" end="00:29:52.850" style="s2">storage nukes and hydrolysis and get</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.210" end="00:29:55.970" style="s2">your take on where we&#39;re at in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.850" end="00:29:57.640" style="s2">innovation learning curves etc on each</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.970" end="00:30:00.500" style="s2">of those technologies that&#39;s that okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.640" end="00:30:02.870" style="s2">sounds good all right let&#39;s start off</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.500" end="00:30:04.700" style="s2">with solar where are we and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.870" end="00:30:07.580" style="s2">prospects look like for the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.700" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">next decade or two yeah so costs have</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.580" end="00:30:13.550" style="s2">fallen by about 99 percent over the last</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:16.030" style="s2">40 years for solar energy and here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.550" end="00:30:17.960" style="s2">talking about photovoltaic solar energy</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.030" end="00:30:21.290" style="s2">specifically and costs have come down</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.960" end="00:30:25.010" style="s2">significantly we&#39;re at a point now where</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.290" end="00:30:26.990" style="s2">in many places solar energy is cost</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.010" end="00:30:31.160" style="s2">competitive with other sources of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.990" end="00:30:33.770" style="s2">electricity now that is for a case where</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.160" end="00:30:35.630" style="s2">you&#39;re using small amounts of solar</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.770" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">energy and so the challenge going</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.630" end="00:30:39.320" style="s2">forward is to continue to bring those</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.690" style="s2">costs down because if you want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.320" end="00:30:45.890" style="s2">in what I call augmenting technologies</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.690" end="00:30:47.480" style="s2">like energy storage in order to balance</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.890" end="00:30:49.490" style="s2">the intermittency in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.480" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">ability of solar energy then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.490" end="00:30:53.690" style="s2">gonna need to invest more in these</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:56.690" style="s2">plants so there&#39;s still a need for</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.690" end="00:30:59.990" style="s2">further cost reduction in part just to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.690" end="00:31:02.330" style="s2">be able to bring in energy storage or</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.990" end="00:31:05.450" style="s2">other similar technologies to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.330" end="00:31:07.850" style="s2">the variability of solar now in many</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.450" end="00:31:10.970" style="s2">places solar energy is just providing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.850" end="00:31:12.890" style="s2">few percent at most of electricity so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.970" end="00:31:15.620" style="s2">there&#39;s still room for growth and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.890" end="00:31:17.750" style="s2">solar energy will be cost competitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.620" end="00:31:20.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just that when you start to get to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.750" end="00:31:22.670" style="s2">larger amounts of electricity coming</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.510" end="00:31:23.930" style="s2">from solar that&#39;s when you start to need</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.670" end="00:31:25.960" style="s2">storage and that&#39;s where we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.930" end="00:31:28.760" style="s2">need to see continued cost declines</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.960" end="00:31:30.740" style="s2">what&#39;s the science driving the PV</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.760" end="00:31:34.130" style="s2">improvement you know so we looked at</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.740" end="00:31:36.470" style="s2">this and published a paper in in 2018</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.130" end="00:31:39.590" style="s2">and and a number of others have looked</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.470" end="00:31:41.720" style="s2">also at some of these factors like my</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.590" end="00:31:44.600" style="s2">colleagues Greg Nimet and Kelly</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.720" end="00:31:46.790" style="s2">Gallagher but our approach in the paper</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.600" end="00:31:49.460" style="s2">that we published in 2018 was to start</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.790" end="00:31:52.340" style="s2">with the devices themselves and say what</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.460" end="00:31:55.700" style="s2">has changed since 1980 with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.340" end="00:31:57.710" style="s2">photovoltaic module physically with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.700" end="00:32:00.230" style="s2">actual device itself what has changed</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.710" end="00:32:01.940" style="s2">and then how did that lead to cost</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.230" end="00:32:03.910" style="s2">reductions and then from there we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.940" end="00:32:07.040" style="s2">say how much of the cost reduction came</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.910" end="00:32:08.870" style="s2">from research and development how much</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.040" end="00:32:10.460" style="s2">from economies of scale how much from</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.870" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">learning by doing and then from there we</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.460" end="00:32:14.570" style="s2">can see what kinds of government</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:16.340" style="s2">policies were important so just to step</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.570" end="00:32:18.920" style="s2">back for a second and say something</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.340" end="00:32:22.700" style="s2">about these government policies you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.920" end="00:32:25.940" style="s2">we we know that solar energy globally</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.700" end="00:32:27.710" style="s2">would not have grown without some</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.940" end="00:32:29.540" style="s2">government policy support because it</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.710" end="00:32:31.730" style="s2">started out very much more expensive</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.540" end="00:32:34.490" style="s2">about a hundred times more expensive</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.730" end="00:32:36.830" style="s2">than you know the alternative sources</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.490" end="00:32:39.110" style="s2">that were used at the time when solar</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.830" end="00:32:41.660" style="s2">energy start to grow so it was more</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.110" end="00:32:42.920" style="s2">expensive and government policy in</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.660" end="00:32:45.530" style="s2">various forms</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.920" end="00:32:48.860" style="s2">it could be subsidies we saw guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.530" end="00:32:50.870" style="s2">prices we saw regulations these policies</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.860" end="00:32:54.800" style="s2">around the world incentivize people to</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.870" end="00:32:57.110" style="s2">adopt solar energy and this is often</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.800" end="00:32:59.780" style="s2">held up as a success story in climate</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.110" end="00:33:00.770" style="s2">policy but before we publish this paper</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.780" end="00:33:03.890" style="s2">I would often</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.770" end="00:33:06.020" style="s2">ask audiences and frankly still I asked</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.890" end="00:33:07.850" style="s2">audiences and and I&#39;m still you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.020" end="00:33:09.140" style="s2">trying to get these results out there so</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.850" end="00:33:12.440" style="s2">they haven&#39;t necessarily read the paper</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.140" end="00:33:15.220" style="s2">but I asked audiences what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.440" end="00:33:19.190" style="s2">what policies were important for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.220" end="00:33:21.410" style="s2">caustic line that 99% caustic line and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.190" end="00:33:24.010" style="s2">give them options of different amounts</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.410" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">of the caustic line coming from</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.010" end="00:33:28.370" style="s2">government funding for research and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:30.530" style="s2">development or a government funding for</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.370" end="00:33:32.660" style="s2">those markets stimulating policies and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.530" end="00:33:34.460" style="s2">you know the answers are all over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.660" end="00:33:37.880" style="s2">place some people will guess that only</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.460" end="00:33:39.920" style="s2">10% came from government funding for</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.880" end="00:33:42.140" style="s2">research and 90% came from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.920" end="00:33:44.750" style="s2">government the market stimulated Paul</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.140" end="00:33:47.570" style="s2">stimulating policies and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.750" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">opposite end of the spectrum two people</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.570" end="00:33:52.670" style="s2">will guess that 90% came from government</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:55.580" style="s2">funding for research and 10% of the cost</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.670" end="00:33:57.650" style="s2">decline came from policies to stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.580" end="00:33:59.990" style="s2">market growth so it&#39;s interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.650" end="00:34:02.300" style="s2">that you know despite this being held up</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.990" end="00:34:05.630" style="s2">is probably the most significant success</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.300" end="00:34:09.500" style="s2">story in clean energy policy and climate</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.630" end="00:34:11.840" style="s2">policy people you know when asked many</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.500" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">experts you know the answers are all</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.840" end="00:34:16.429" style="s2">over the place so this was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:18.200" style="s2">motivations for looking at ok what can</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.429" end="00:34:20.810" style="s2">we pin down what some of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.200" end="00:34:22.790" style="s2">were for the cost decline and so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.810" end="00:34:24.919" style="s2">we started with the low level mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.790" end="00:34:26.600" style="s2">the changes to the device itself and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.919" end="00:34:28.880" style="s2">then we looked at the high level</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.600" end="00:34:30.919" style="s2">mechanisms and the policy drivers and at</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.880" end="00:34:33.020" style="s2">the level of the device we see that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.919" end="00:34:35.750" style="s2">single largest contributor that the cost</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.020" end="00:34:37.640" style="s2">decline was an increase in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.750" end="00:34:40.250" style="s2">conversion efficiency of the panel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.640" end="00:34:43.429" style="s2">themselves but we also see that many</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.250" end="00:34:45.260" style="s2">other changes at the level of the device</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.429" end="00:34:48.110" style="s2">were important like changes to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.260" end="00:34:50.929" style="s2">amount of silicon used changes to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.110" end="00:34:54.200" style="s2">wafer size and other kinds of changes at</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.929" end="00:34:56.270" style="s2">that level so that may be actually one</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.200" end="00:35:00.230" style="s2">of the reasons why this technology</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.270" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">showed this steady and rapid cost</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.230" end="00:35:03.800" style="s2">decline over time was that there were</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:06.830" style="s2">many different mechanisms that could</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.800" end="00:35:08.870" style="s2">kick in over that 40-year period I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.830" end="00:35:10.670" style="s2">talking about it and then we go up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.870" end="00:35:12.260" style="s2">the high level mechanisms I can talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.670" end="00:35:14.060" style="s2">about that if you&#39;re interested but then</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.260" end="00:35:17.750" style="s2">just to jump up to the policy</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.060" end="00:35:20.120" style="s2">we estimate that 30% of the cost decline</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.750" end="00:35:25.130" style="s2">came from government funding for</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.120" end="00:35:28.150" style="s2">research and 60% from market stimulating</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.130" end="00:35:31.250" style="s2">policies and then 10% from other sources</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.150" end="00:35:33.290" style="s2">so this is important not because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.250" end="00:35:35.300" style="s2">been a debate for a long time about</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.290" end="00:35:38.450" style="s2">whether government should be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.300" end="00:35:41.330" style="s2">the market or if instead some would</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.450" end="00:35:43.490" style="s2">argue government should focus on funding</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.330" end="00:35:45.290" style="s2">research and then we wait until the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.490" end="00:35:46.790" style="s2">technologies are ready and the milk are</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.290" end="00:35:49.730" style="s2">on the market but what we see when we</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.790" end="00:35:51.890" style="s2">look under the hood at the this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.730" end="00:35:54.380" style="s2">technology and what actually changed and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.890" end="00:35:56.330" style="s2">who did what is that those market</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.380" end="00:35:59.030" style="s2">stimulating policies played a really</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.330" end="00:36:01.010" style="s2">important role in this case and my</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.030" end="00:36:03.290" style="s2">takeaway from this is that we probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.010" end="00:36:04.970" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be where we are today if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.290" end="00:36:06.860" style="s2">hadn&#39;t had these markets stimulating</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.970" end="00:36:08.630" style="s2">policies and that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.860" end="00:36:10.910" style="s2">in the context of something like rights</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.630" end="00:36:12.860" style="s2">law right as you pointed out you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.910" end="00:36:14.180" style="s2">caught in this trap if it&#39;s market only</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.860" end="00:36:16.490" style="s2">in the early days when it&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.180" end="00:36:19.100" style="s2">times more expensive no one&#39;s gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:22.040" style="s2">it but if we have some reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.100" end="00:36:23.360" style="s2">confident that rights law will work then</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.040" end="00:36:25.970" style="s2">it makes sense to do things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.360" end="00:36:27.350" style="s2">portfolio mandates or you know giant</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.970" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2">subsidies even though they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.350" end="00:36:31.880" style="s2">economic in the short term to drive us</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:34.190" style="s2">up the learning curve to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.880" end="00:36:36.050" style="s2">it does make sense yeah and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.190" end="00:36:38.540" style="s2">where like something like rights law it</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.050" end="00:36:42.200" style="s2">may seem like a very academic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.540" end="00:36:45.350" style="s2">niche concept to many people maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.200" end="00:36:47.780" style="s2">of your listeners but it&#39;s actually I</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.350" end="00:36:50.270" style="s2">would say pretty important to consider</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.780" end="00:36:52.250" style="s2">for a forming in forming many different</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.270" end="00:36:54.110" style="s2">kinds of Technology decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.250" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">people may have you know whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.110" end="00:37:00.020" style="s2">private investors or government</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:02.210" style="s2">policymakers or even engineers and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.020" end="00:37:04.040" style="s2">can start with rights law to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.210" end="00:37:06.980" style="s2">there&#39;s this relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.040" end="00:37:09.530" style="s2">production and as I produce more I tend</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.980" end="00:37:11.480" style="s2">to see costs come down following this</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.530" end="00:37:13.490" style="s2">power law and that&#39;s a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.480" end="00:37:16.210" style="s2">start but then of course if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.490" end="00:37:18.680" style="s2">look at the underlying mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.210" end="00:37:20.360" style="s2">you know the different kinds of efforts</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.680" end="00:37:23.270" style="s2">that lead to improvement that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.360" end="00:37:25.610" style="s2">you&#39;d want to go into applying the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.270" end="00:37:26.670" style="s2">approaches that I mentioned earlier so</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.610" end="00:37:28.380" style="s2">there you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.670" end="00:37:30.150" style="s2">we&#39;re not just looking at production and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.380" end="00:37:32.970" style="s2">how costs come down with production but</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.150" end="00:37:36.390" style="s2">we&#39;re going deeper into what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.970" end="00:37:39.830" style="s2">different efforts that went into working</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.390" end="00:37:42.770" style="s2">on this technology so it&#39;s it&#39;s actual</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.830" end="00:37:45.600" style="s2">repeated processes or learning by doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.770" end="00:37:48.540" style="s2">but it&#39;s also research and development</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.600" end="00:37:50.340" style="s2">both publicly funded research and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.540" end="00:37:52.110" style="s2">development and also privately funded</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.340" end="00:37:53.490" style="s2">research and development and economies</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.110" end="00:37:55.890" style="s2">of scale which is more of like an</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.490" end="00:37:58.260" style="s2">emergent property so we can kind of dig</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.890" end="00:38:00.870" style="s2">into that more and come up with more</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.260" end="00:38:03.900" style="s2">mechanistic explanations which then can</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.870" end="00:38:05.400" style="s2">inform other kinds of decisions you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.900" end="00:38:07.950" style="s2">like I have a portfolio of investments</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.400" end="00:38:11.460" style="s2">as a government and I want to decide how</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.950" end="00:38:13.560" style="s2">much do I want to mandate that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.460" end="00:38:16.290" style="s2">electricity should come from these five</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.560" end="00:38:19.670" style="s2">different sources you might apply rates</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.290" end="00:38:23.640" style="s2">curve but if you&#39;re somebody that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.670" end="00:38:26.040" style="s2">deciding on the allocation of research</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.640" end="00:38:28.080" style="s2">and development funding versus expanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.040" end="00:38:31.110" style="s2">production either a government policy</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.080" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">maker or a private investor or someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.110" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">running a company then you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:37.980" style="s2">apply that more mechanistic approach</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:39.930" style="s2">that I mentioned it&#39;s gonna be a mix of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.980" end="00:38:41.400" style="s2">them it&#39;s a multi optimization problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.930" end="00:38:44.490" style="s2">and it&#39;s also depends on the timeframe</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.400" end="00:38:46.080" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at right yeah so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.490" end="00:38:47.640" style="s2">talked mostly about the past you have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.080" end="00:38:50.190" style="s2">perspective on the future of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.640" end="00:38:52.350" style="s2">photovoltaic what are we likely to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.190" end="00:38:54.750" style="s2">expect to over the next say 10 to 20</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.350" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">years in terms of improvements yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.750" end="00:38:58.620" style="s2">mean I think we&#39;ll continue to see</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:02.970" style="s2">improvements over the next 10 to 20</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.620" end="00:39:05.160" style="s2">years one of the areas that is really</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.970" end="00:39:09.180" style="s2">important to focus on though are what</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.160" end="00:39:12.660" style="s2">are called soft costs so I can explain</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.180" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">what what that means but but if we take</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.660" end="00:39:20.130" style="s2">the solar energy system or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:23.940" style="s2">photovoltaic system we can break it up</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.130" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">into the module and what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.940" end="00:39:27.780" style="s2">balance of systems so that&#39;s everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:30.270" style="s2">else that includes the inverter it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.780" end="00:39:33.570" style="s2">includes a construction cost etc and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.270" end="00:39:35.670" style="s2">that gives us the total cost and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.570" end="00:39:37.330" style="s2">looking forward I do expect that we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.670" end="00:39:40.030" style="s2">see some improvements</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.330" end="00:39:42.670" style="s2">photovoltaic module costs including and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.030" end="00:39:44.410" style="s2">in silicon based photovoltaic modules</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.670" end="00:39:46.840" style="s2">but there are also some new exciting</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.410" end="00:39:49.810" style="s2">developments like profs kite solar cells</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.840" end="00:39:51.970" style="s2">the future there is uncertain but but</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.810" end="00:39:54.310" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.970" end="00:39:57.100" style="s2">promising area to look at but then let</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.310" end="00:39:58.660" style="s2">me focus on the other those other costs</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.100" end="00:40:00.670" style="s2">the balance of systems and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.660" end="00:40:02.910" style="s2">specifically on what I mentioned are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.670" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">soft costs so that would include the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.910" end="00:40:08.110" style="s2">construction cost so it&#39;s the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">labor it would include the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.110" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">permitting and what&#39;s called the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:14.440" style="s2">interconnection so connecting to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:17.800" style="s2">grid and that&#39;s a really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.440" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">important area because what we see is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.800" end="00:40:24.490" style="s2">that those costs are coming to dominate</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:26.770" style="s2">the total cost so well the module costs</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.490" end="00:40:29.710" style="s2">have come down an inverter costs have</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.770" end="00:40:31.570" style="s2">come down those soft costs have not come</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.710" end="00:40:33.700" style="s2">down we do see that in some countries</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.570" end="00:40:35.890" style="s2">they&#39;re much lower than in others so in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.700" end="00:40:38.410" style="s2">Germany it&#39;s estimated that those costs</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.890" end="00:40:40.140" style="s2">are about 50% what they are in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.410" end="00:40:43.360" style="s2">so they&#39;re half what they are in the US</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.140" end="00:40:46.090" style="s2">but we also see that you know within</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.360" end="00:40:48.610" style="s2">individual countries that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.090" end="00:40:50.980" style="s2">not seeing as much signs of changes in</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.610" end="00:40:53.080" style="s2">those costs as we&#39;d like to see so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.980" end="00:40:56.110" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really important and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.080" end="00:40:58.360" style="s2">potentially very rewarding area to work</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.110" end="00:41:00.610" style="s2">on it&#39;s again one that I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.360" end="00:41:02.380" style="s2">and I know many others including the US</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.610" end="00:41:04.810" style="s2">Department of Energy is interested in</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.380" end="00:41:07.570" style="s2">this one of the things that I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.810" end="00:41:09.970" style="s2">could work there is actually again in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.570" end="00:41:13.540" style="s2">this area of soft technology and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.970" end="00:41:15.490" style="s2">basically finding ways to codify and</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.540" end="00:41:17.800" style="s2">knowledge of what works to bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.490" end="00:41:20.730" style="s2">permitting costs down to bring labor</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.800" end="00:41:24.190" style="s2">costs down in our connection cost down</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.730" end="00:41:26.230" style="s2">collecting data and making sure the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.190" end="00:41:28.990" style="s2">incentives are in place for those costs</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.230" end="00:41:31.000" style="s2">to drop and that you know that could</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.990" end="00:41:34.630" style="s2">really be very impactful for solar</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.000" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2">energy okay quick aside it wasn&#39;t long</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.630" end="00:41:38.020" style="s2">ago there was a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.220" end="00:41:41.140" style="s2">investment including Google not dumb</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.020" end="00:41:42.700" style="s2">people in thermosolar with liquid salt</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.140" end="00:41:45.700" style="s2">storage whatever became of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.700" end="00:41:47.830" style="s2">technology yeah so thermal solar or</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.700" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">otherwise known as concentrating solar</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.830" end="00:41:53.410" style="s2">power is one that hasn&#39;t taken off</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:55.960" style="s2">as much as people might like the concept</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.410" end="00:41:57.700" style="s2">is different from photovoltaics and one</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.960" end="00:42:01.450" style="s2">of the big differences is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.700" end="00:42:03.250" style="s2">using direct solar radiation so you no</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.450" end="00:42:05.530" style="s2">longer benefit from indirect solar</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.250" end="00:42:07.540" style="s2">radiation and that&#39;s because the way it</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.530" end="00:42:10.270" style="s2">works is you use a system of mirrors to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.540" end="00:42:12.910" style="s2">concentrate sunlight and to heat some</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.270" end="00:42:15.100" style="s2">medium and so that could be molten salt</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.910" end="00:42:16.570" style="s2">for example as you mentioned and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.100" end="00:42:19.480" style="s2">bring that to a very high temperature</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.570" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">and then you use that to operate</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.480" end="00:42:25.030" style="s2">something that&#39;s similar to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:26.860" style="s2">conventional thermal power plant and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.030" end="00:42:29.860" style="s2">those mirrors are set up to capture</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.860" end="00:42:31.960" style="s2">direct sunlight we&#39;re not able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.860" end="00:42:33.670" style="s2">capture indirect sunlight in those</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.960" end="00:42:36.100" style="s2">systems and so that means that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.670" end="00:42:38.920" style="s2">really best applied in very sunny</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.100" end="00:42:40.360" style="s2">climates and I think there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.920" end="00:42:42.430" style="s2">there&#39;s still a lot of potential for</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.360" end="00:42:44.290" style="s2">concentrating solar power and when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.430" end="00:42:45.850" style="s2">look back at the history of technologies</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.290" end="00:42:48.610" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.850" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">see things coming into favor</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.610" end="00:42:54.940" style="s2">you know expectations maybe being a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:56.830" style="s2">little bit too high the technology or</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.940" end="00:42:59.290" style="s2">industry isn&#39;t able to meet those</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.830" end="00:43:01.240" style="s2">expectations and then interest drops but</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.290" end="00:43:03.430" style="s2">then it kind of has a resurgence so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.240" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t rule out concentrating solar</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.430" end="00:43:08.320" style="s2">power yet but it&#39;s tricky to say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.670" end="00:43:10.690" style="s2">going to happen with that technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.320" end="00:43:12.250" style="s2">going forward yeah I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.690" end="00:43:13.990" style="s2">surprised that you know people as smart</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.250" end="00:43:15.700" style="s2">as Google would have spent you know big</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.990" end="00:43:17.980" style="s2">dollars on that and come up with a goose</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.700" end="00:43:19.090" style="s2">egg but that&#39;s what happens sometimes as</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.980" end="00:43:21.250" style="s2">you say maybe in the future something</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.090" end="00:43:23.470" style="s2">will come back let&#39;s move on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.250" end="00:43:26.320" style="s2">big one which is wind what is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.470" end="00:43:27.820" style="s2">learning curve look like on win both</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.320" end="00:43:30.280" style="s2">looking back a little bit and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.820" end="00:43:33.430" style="s2">looking forward yeah so we&#39;ve seen again</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.280" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">major reductions in cost and in wind</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.430" end="00:43:41.260" style="s2">electricity and we&#39;ve so actually let me</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:43.750" style="s2">pause for a minute gem so part of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.260" end="00:43:46.090" style="s2">reason it&#39;s tricky to make that forecast</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.750" end="00:43:49.090" style="s2">that you wanted with time for solar and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.090" end="00:43:52.660" style="s2">also for wind it&#39;s the same is that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.090" end="00:43:56.080" style="s2">really depends on what happens on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.660" end="00:43:58.060" style="s2">policy side as well so we we wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.080" end="00:44:01.720" style="s2">report ahead of the Paris climate</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.060" end="00:44:03.980" style="s2">negotiations and looked at the different</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">commitments that countries had made</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.980" end="00:44:08.900" style="s2">to the Paris agreement and asked how</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:13.190" style="s2">much might solar and wind electricity</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.900" end="00:44:16.210" style="s2">cost fall between now and 2030 and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.190" end="00:44:19.270" style="s2">estimated that cost could fall by 50%</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.210" end="00:44:22.490" style="s2">for solar energy and they could fall by</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.270" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">25% for wind energy and I will say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.490" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">so far since we did that study ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:28.940" style="s2">the the Paris climate negotiations costs</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:31.310" style="s2">have continued to come down for both of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.940" end="00:44:34.609" style="s2">these technologies now that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.310" end="00:44:36.740" style="s2">estimate and indiscernible into these</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.609" end="00:44:39.260" style="s2">technologies if we increase that effort</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.740" end="00:44:41.540" style="s2">then things could improve more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.260" end="00:44:45.080" style="s2">or if we decrease we fall back on that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.540" end="00:44:47.060" style="s2">effort then things could be slower yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.080" end="00:44:48.980" style="s2">assuming that rights laws the main one</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.060" end="00:44:50.869" style="s2">in operation it makes perfect sense the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.980" end="00:44:52.520" style="s2">more we build the cheaper it gets right</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.869" end="00:44:55.700" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.520" end="00:44:58.990" style="s2">and yeah so that&#39;s you know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:45:02.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s fair to assume rights law</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.990" end="00:45:04.520" style="s2">given what we know so far I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.090" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the best forecasting method and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.520" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">certainly with any forecast you want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:12.020" style="s2">also forecast your expected errors so</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.680" end="00:45:13.430" style="s2">that&#39;s something that we typically do so</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.020" end="00:45:15.710" style="s2">there would be ranges around those</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.430" end="00:45:17.240" style="s2">estimates that I just mentioned that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.710" end="00:45:18.590" style="s2">really important because then you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.240" end="00:45:21.530" style="s2">figure out how to diversify your</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.590" end="00:45:23.869" style="s2">portfolio you know to deal with those</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.530" end="00:45:25.880" style="s2">uncertainties but yeah a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.869" end="00:45:29.060" style="s2">research we&#39;ve been doing does provide</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.880" end="00:45:30.950" style="s2">some support for for rights law now if</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.060" end="00:45:32.750" style="s2">you&#39;re a small player and you&#39;re someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.950" end="00:45:34.850" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have agency you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.750" end="00:45:36.590" style="s2">a decision about global production or</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.850" end="00:45:39.320" style="s2">large amounts of production then you may</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.590" end="00:45:40.820" style="s2">want to apply Moore&#39;s law instead to</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.320" end="00:45:42.980" style="s2">make your forecast so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.820" end="00:45:45.470" style="s2">that&#39;s what ways in which these theories</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.980" end="00:45:47.720" style="s2">can be implemented and used by decision</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.470" end="00:45:49.550" style="s2">makers but yeah to come back to your</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.720" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">question you asked about wind</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.550" end="00:45:54.200" style="s2">electricity right and then where we see</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:57.230" style="s2">that wind electricity costs have fallen</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.200" end="00:45:59.540" style="s2">and shown a pretty impressive trend and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.230" end="00:46:02.540" style="s2">there&#39;s room for further improvement and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.540" end="00:46:05.410" style="s2">one area that I want to highlight that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.540" end="00:46:08.930" style="s2">looks very promising is offshore wind</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.410" end="00:46:11.240" style="s2">this is a market that&#39;s growing and one</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.930" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">of the benefits of offshore wind is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.240" end="00:46:16.710" style="s2">you&#39;re able to access more predictable</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:19.349" style="s2">more more sustained less</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.710" end="00:46:22.890" style="s2">variable wind speeds and wind patterns</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.349" end="00:46:24.300" style="s2">by putting your systems offshore so</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.890" end="00:46:27.000" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the benefits you&#39;re also</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.000" end="00:46:30.839" style="s2">resource in many cases so that&#39;s an area</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.369" end="00:46:32.790" style="s2">that many are working on there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.839" end="00:46:35.940" style="s2">some innovation challenges and a need</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.790" end="00:46:38.730" style="s2">for research and development investment</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.940" end="00:46:41.220" style="s2">in that technology but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.730" end="00:46:43.349" style="s2">potential there and currently if we look</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.220" end="00:46:45.330" style="s2">at the costs of wind electricity again</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.349" end="00:46:48.810" style="s2">you see that it&#39;s cost competitive in</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.330" end="00:46:51.900" style="s2">many locations but it has the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.810" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">that I mentioned before with solar which</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.900" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">is one of the reasons why you would want</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:58.500" style="s2">to bring the cost down further because</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.890" end="00:47:00.750" style="s2">if you need to install energy storage</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.500" end="00:47:03.030" style="s2">alongside these technologies that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.750" end="00:47:05.250" style="s2">additional investment that would have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.030" end="00:47:07.830" style="s2">be made and as you start using more and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.250" end="00:47:09.810" style="s2">more wind energy you&#39;ll need either</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.830" end="00:47:13.230" style="s2">supplemental generation from other</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.810" end="00:47:15.690" style="s2">sources or energy storage in order to</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.230" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">reliably meet demand gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.690" end="00:47:19.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a perfect transition to the next</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:21.540" style="s2">technology which is distribution you</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.800" end="00:47:25.230" style="s2">made the very good and important point</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.540" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">that Geographic what&#39;s the health damned</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.230" end="00:47:28.890" style="s2">word I&#39;m looking for here</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:30.180" style="s2">diversification diversification the only</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.890" end="00:47:32.460" style="s2">free lunch and Finance is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.180" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">diversification right and while it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.460" end="00:47:36.839" style="s2">quite free and energy you can get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:39.330" style="s2">of free lunch with geographic</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:41.150" style="s2">diversification but to do that you need</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.330" end="00:47:43.290" style="s2">an upgrade of our distribution network</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.150" end="00:47:47.010" style="s2">sometimes I talk about you know building</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.290" end="00:47:48.810" style="s2">these high voltage DC long-haul cables</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.010" end="00:47:50.820" style="s2">as the interstate highway system for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.810" end="00:47:52.260" style="s2">21st century if you could tell us a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.820" end="00:47:53.970" style="s2">little bit about what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.260" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">distribution and what needs to go on in</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.970" end="00:47:59.070" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">yeah so in improving and expanding the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.070" end="00:48:01.830" style="s2">transmission and distribution</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:03.780" style="s2">infrastructure for electricity is</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.830" end="00:48:06.540" style="s2">absolutely critical especially if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.780" end="00:48:10.040" style="s2">rely on increasing amounts variable</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.540" end="00:48:12.780" style="s2">solar and wind energy it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.040" end="00:48:14.089" style="s2">improve and continue to expand the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.780" end="00:48:16.200" style="s2">transmission and distribution</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.089" end="00:48:19.050" style="s2">infrastructure and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.200" end="00:48:23.099" style="s2">interest in that and you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.050" end="00:48:25.320" style="s2">costs should be manageable at least the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.099" end="00:48:28.680" style="s2">engineering cost estimates the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.320" end="00:48:29.829" style="s2">challenges come in in terms of other</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.680" end="00:48:33.130" style="s2">factors</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.829" end="00:48:34.869" style="s2">like whether people in the areas that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.130" end="00:48:37.180" style="s2">would be affected if you&#39;re building a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.869" end="00:48:38.799" style="s2">new long-distance high voltage</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.180" end="00:48:43.029" style="s2">transmission line whether people in</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.799" end="00:48:45.609" style="s2">those areas will be willing to allow</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.029" end="00:48:47.559" style="s2">those projects and also whether</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.609" end="00:48:49.989" style="s2">investors are willing to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.559" end="00:48:51.759" style="s2">risks of those projects also</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.989" end="00:48:54.069" style="s2">coordination across different</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.759" end="00:48:55.299" style="s2">geographical areas within the US can be</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.069" end="00:48:57.400" style="s2">a challenge some some of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.299" end="00:48:59.619" style="s2">institutional design issues have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.400" end="00:49:02.589" style="s2">worked out but there&#39;s a lot of interest</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.619" end="00:49:04.539" style="s2">in that and I think whether or not this</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.589" end="00:49:07.479" style="s2">really takes off will have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.539" end="00:49:10.869" style="s2">what kind of climate policy we have but</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.479" end="00:49:12.849" style="s2">also from a bottom-up perspective it has</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.869" end="00:49:15.279" style="s2">to do with whether people are able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.849" end="00:49:18.759" style="s2">get together and coordinate and make</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.279" end="00:49:21.729" style="s2">decisions to go forward with some of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.759" end="00:49:23.849" style="s2">these projects or whether you know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.729" end="00:49:27.209" style="s2">coordination proves too difficult so</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.849" end="00:49:30.279" style="s2">again I think about this problem in</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.209" end="00:49:32.559" style="s2">terms of what is the right portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.279" end="00:49:36.029" style="s2">approach and certainly we need to keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.559" end="00:49:38.589" style="s2">pushing on transmission and distribution</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.029" end="00:49:42.789" style="s2">infrastructure improvement and expansion</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.589" end="00:49:45.309" style="s2">and I do think that in some places it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.789" end="00:49:46.299" style="s2">going to have a very big impact and but</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.309" end="00:49:48.699" style="s2">it&#39;s probably going to be more</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.299" end="00:49:51.519" style="s2">applicable in some places than in others</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.699" end="00:49:53.469" style="s2">so if you have obviously small islands</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.519" end="00:49:56.249" style="s2">that becomes more difficult in those</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.469" end="00:49:59.890" style="s2">cases or if you have areas that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.249" end="00:50:02.170" style="s2">separated by large mountain ranges or</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.890" end="00:50:04.930" style="s2">national parks or other you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.170" end="00:50:07.239" style="s2">pristine wildlife areas that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.930" end="00:50:10.269" style="s2">protected and that people you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.239" end="00:50:13.029" style="s2">understandably don&#39;t want to go into and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.269" end="00:50:15.249" style="s2">and build on then you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.029" end="00:50:16.589" style="s2">some limitations there so really for</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.249" end="00:50:19.749" style="s2">transmission and distribution</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.589" end="00:50:23.079" style="s2">infrastructure expansion we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.749" end="00:50:24.849" style="s2">at the specifics of the continents the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.079" end="00:50:27.640" style="s2">countries the states that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.849" end="00:50:29.920" style="s2">considering and see whether this is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.640" end="00:50:32.920" style="s2">practical option in those locations and</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.920" end="00:50:35.650" style="s2">in places where it is then it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.920" end="00:50:37.209" style="s2">idea you mentioned the coordination</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.650" end="00:50:39.579" style="s2">problem what I tend to call the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.209" end="00:50:41.949" style="s2">collective action problem right it makes</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.579" end="00:50:43.150" style="s2">sense to do it but you can&#39;t get people</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.949" end="00:50:44.770" style="s2">to agree for</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.150" end="00:50:47.140" style="s2">you know local interest reasons</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.770" end="00:50:48.580" style="s2">self-interest etc that&#39;s why I put the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.140" end="00:50:50.440" style="s2">framing on it maybe we should think of</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.580" end="00:50:53.080" style="s2">it as the interstate highway system of</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.440" end="00:50:55.240" style="s2">the 21st century where we just decide at</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.080" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">the top it&#39;s worth spending the money to</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.240" end="00:50:58.510" style="s2">make it happen you know the interstate</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:01.030" style="s2">highway system for those kids today</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.510" end="00:51:04.150" style="s2">don&#39;t remember was built in the 50s 60s</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.030" end="00:51:06.220" style="s2">70s and the federal government paid 90%</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.150" end="00:51:08.860" style="s2">of the cost as a way to incentivize and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.220" end="00:51:11.470" style="s2">override local objections and it worked</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.860" end="00:51:13.720" style="s2">yeah I mean certainly those top-down</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.470" end="00:51:16.930" style="s2">approaches can work and we do see that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.720" end="00:51:19.210" style="s2">in some nations today we see more</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.930" end="00:51:22.390" style="s2">top-down decisions happening and in some</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.210" end="00:51:25.180" style="s2">places that seems to work better than in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.390" end="00:51:28.510" style="s2">others we&#39;ve seen strong climate policy</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.180" end="00:51:31.510" style="s2">in the Scandinavian countries if we look</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.510" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">at the case of China in that area in</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.510" end="00:51:36.670" style="s2">terms of you know planning for energy</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:39.120" style="s2">infrastructure they take a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.670" end="00:51:43.500" style="s2">approach as well in some other places</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.120" end="00:51:45.970" style="s2">these top-down policies don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.500" end="00:51:49.660" style="s2">really the way in in which things are</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.970" end="00:51:52.050" style="s2">moving so in the US for example you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.660" end="00:51:55.630" style="s2">the current administration isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.050" end="00:51:57.010" style="s2">focusing on climate policy or climate</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.630" end="00:51:59.170" style="s2">change is an issue and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.010" end="00:52:01.270" style="s2">seeing is more bottom ups what are</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.170" end="00:52:04.030" style="s2">called sub-national actors you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.270" end="00:52:08.320" style="s2">basically mayors and governors of states</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.030" end="00:52:11.430" style="s2">and other local policymakers stepping in</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.320" end="00:52:14.830" style="s2">to work on these issues and adopt</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.430" end="00:52:17.620" style="s2">policies but of course those policy</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.830" end="00:52:20.050" style="s2">makers are covering a smaller area they</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.620" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">have jurisdiction they&#39;re representing</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.050" end="00:52:24.670" style="s2">smaller populations and so then you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:27.460" style="s2">a bit more of a coordination challenge</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.670" end="00:52:30.070" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think that all is lost I do</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.460" end="00:52:32.220" style="s2">think that there are ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.070" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">could think about and again be creative</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.220" end="00:52:39.610" style="s2">about finding ways to move forward with</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:41.020" style="s2">coordination to incentivize coordination</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.610" end="00:52:44.020" style="s2">and again we can potentially use</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.020" end="00:52:46.150" style="s2">software for this I think we can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.020" end="00:52:47.890" style="s2">thinking creatively about how to absolve</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.150" end="00:52:50.350" style="s2">the collective action problem that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.890" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">that you talked about many people</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.350" end="00:52:53.270" style="s2">individually would like to make a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.310" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.270" end="00:52:57.650" style="s2">we see that we see that based on math</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.310" end="00:52:59.960" style="s2">surveys you see that if you go around</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.650" end="00:53:03.470" style="s2">and talk to people I mean I was just on</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.960" end="00:53:04.850" style="s2">a sabbatical and I was in various parts</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.470" end="00:53:07.160" style="s2">of the country and I would talk to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.850" end="00:53:10.010" style="s2">people with all sorts of different you</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.160" end="00:53:13.010" style="s2">know backgrounds and about this issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.010" end="00:53:15.050" style="s2">and you do see that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.010" end="00:53:17.660" style="s2">common views even though people may be</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.050" end="00:53:19.610" style="s2">skeptical of climate change when we</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.660" end="00:53:21.740" style="s2">start talking about things that affect</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.610" end="00:53:24.890" style="s2">them personally there is a desire to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.740" end="00:53:26.780" style="s2">protect the environment so anyway that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.890" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">think there is there&#39;s a desire among</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.780" end="00:53:30.320" style="s2">many people to do something about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">problem but each person can feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.320" end="00:53:35.150" style="s2">powerless because their decision alone</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:37.310" style="s2">can&#39;t bring about a large change so</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.150" end="00:53:39.290" style="s2">again we I think we should be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.310" end="00:53:43.310" style="s2">about technology and new creative ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.290" end="00:53:45.680" style="s2">to bring people together to allow for</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.310" end="00:53:49.400" style="s2">this bottom-up action and bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.680" end="00:53:52.190" style="s2">coordination that could accelerate this</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.400" end="00:53:54.440" style="s2">transition to low-carbon energy systems</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.190" end="00:53:55.970" style="s2">well talk about the policy too little</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.440" end="00:53:57.650" style="s2">bit later yeah I don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.970" end="00:53:59.870" style="s2">politically correct I don&#39;t have a job</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.650" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve retired I don&#39;t give a right</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.870" end="00:54:04.790" style="s2">so what I would say is we got to vote</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:07.070" style="s2">out politicians who have their heads up</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.790" end="00:54:09.560" style="s2">their ass on this issue right when he</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.070" end="00:54:11.510" style="s2">both bottom-up and top-down and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.560" end="00:54:13.550" style="s2">currently with the idiotic political</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.510" end="00:54:16.580" style="s2">leadership we have we&#39;re not getting any</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.550" end="00:54:17.480" style="s2">guidance on the top-down side so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.580" end="00:54:19.010" style="s2">got to change</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.480" end="00:54:21.650" style="s2">yeah you don&#39;t need to agree or disagree</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.010" end="00:54:24.110" style="s2">but if you want to you can well no I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.650" end="00:54:25.700" style="s2">just gonna say that policy is is really</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.110" end="00:54:27.710" style="s2">important government policy is really</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.700" end="00:54:30.530" style="s2">important and national level government</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.710" end="00:54:33.380" style="s2">policy can be very impactful</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.530" end="00:54:36.740" style="s2">international agreements can be super</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.380" end="00:54:38.660" style="s2">impactful and so it is I think important</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.740" end="00:54:40.670" style="s2">to highlight for people that their votes</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.660" end="00:54:43.730" style="s2">matter and when they&#39;re voting for in</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.670" end="00:54:46.340" style="s2">demanding climate policy the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.730" end="00:54:49.460" style="s2">that isn&#39;t just to bring about emissions</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.340" end="00:54:51.320" style="s2">reduction but it&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.460" end="00:54:53.870" style="s2">alongside that you have technological</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.320" end="00:54:55.660" style="s2">innovation anytime things are changing</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.870" end="00:54:58.580" style="s2">especially in such an important sector</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.660" end="00:55:00.980" style="s2">like these energy service and youth</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.580" end="00:55:02.870" style="s2">sectors that I&#39;ve been talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.980" end="00:55:04.850" style="s2">know if technology is changing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.870" end="00:55:06.130" style="s2">opportunities there&#39;s opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.850" end="00:55:08.650" style="s2">job creation of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.130" end="00:55:10.539" style="s2">there will be winners and losers but for</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.650" end="00:55:12.910" style="s2">society as a whole there is great</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.539" end="00:55:16.119" style="s2">opportunity there there&#39;s opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.910" end="00:55:18.279" style="s2">address inequities to you know address</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.119" end="00:55:23.890" style="s2">all sorts of environmental and social</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.279" end="00:55:26.440" style="s2">justice issues so I do often try to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.890" end="00:55:29.079" style="s2">this point that voting is really</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.440" end="00:55:32.529" style="s2">important you know and that if you vote</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.079" end="00:55:34.569" style="s2">for options you know if you vote for</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.529" end="00:55:38.410" style="s2">climate policy what you&#39;ll get are</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.569" end="00:55:41.880" style="s2">options that will allow you to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.410" end="00:55:45.819" style="s2">act and make decisions and take action</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.880" end="00:55:49.720" style="s2">along your values and so it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.819" end="00:55:51.579" style="s2">to to vote for a climate policy you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.720" end="00:55:54.009" style="s2">for all of those above reasons there</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.579" end="00:55:57.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge opportunity I guess I worry</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.009" end="00:55:59.559" style="s2">that people feel like all is lost and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.400" end="00:56:01.960" style="s2">feel very down and think my vote can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.559" end="00:56:03.609" style="s2">matter but when we look at some of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.960" end="00:56:05.019" style="s2">trends in the past</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.609" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">like we talked about for solar energy</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.019" end="00:56:12.279" style="s2">you see that we saw this really rapid</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:14.769" style="s2">improvement in this technology that came</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.279" end="00:56:17.619" style="s2">about because of efforts all around the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.769" end="00:56:19.859" style="s2">world by many different kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.619" end="00:56:22.269" style="s2">and different countries kicked in</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.859" end="00:56:25.779" style="s2">support at different points in time and</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.269" end="00:56:28.329" style="s2">it was kind of this emergent trend that</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.779" end="00:56:31.660" style="s2">we saw that is really pretty impressive</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.329" end="00:56:34.450" style="s2">so I think people I like to share that</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.660" end="00:56:37.660" style="s2">story because I think it can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.450" end="00:56:39.910" style="s2">more optimism around this problem we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.660" end="00:56:41.859" style="s2">talk about optimism and and how to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.910" end="00:56:43.420" style="s2">rid of despair at the end but let&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.859" end="00:56:45.910" style="s2">need to move on here getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.420" end="00:56:47.859" style="s2">weeds a little bit more actually I like</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.910" end="00:56:49.480" style="s2">the week the truth is I like the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.859" end="00:56:51.910" style="s2">well we&#39;re using up our time so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.480" end="00:56:55.029" style="s2">hit a learning curve what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.910" end="00:56:57.130" style="s2">storage and nukes quickly will drop</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.029" end="00:56:59.230" style="s2">hydrolysis and then we&#39;ll move on so</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.130" end="00:57:01.539" style="s2">storage what has happened and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.230" end="00:57:04.990" style="s2">where are we on the trend on storage</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.539" end="00:57:08.259" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;ve seen significant declines</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.990" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">in the cost of lithium-ion batteries for</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.259" end="00:57:14.140" style="s2">example so now you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:15.970" style="s2">estimates of costs around $200 per</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.140" end="00:57:18.250" style="s2">kilowatt hour as I mentioned before once</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.970" end="00:57:19.269" style="s2">you use these as stationary storage</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.250" end="00:57:21.819" style="s2">devices</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.269" end="00:57:23.769" style="s2">and installations there other costs that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.819" end="00:57:26.469" style="s2">are incurred but costs have come down</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.769" end="00:57:28.119" style="s2">significantly and the other important</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.469" end="00:57:29.589" style="s2">trend to know it is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.119" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">working on many different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.589" end="00:57:33.819" style="s2">storage technologies you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:36.880" style="s2">before that you had worked on vanadium</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.819" end="00:57:38.289" style="s2">redox flow batteries that&#39;s one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.880" end="00:57:41.049" style="s2">flow battery but there are many other</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.289" end="00:57:43.269" style="s2">kinds of flow batteries that various</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.049" end="00:57:46.839" style="s2">researchers are working on some of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.269" end="00:57:48.189" style="s2">here at my institution at MIT and these</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.839" end="00:57:51.640" style="s2">are batteries where you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.189" end="00:57:54.159" style="s2">replacing the electrolyte and this opens</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.640" end="00:57:56.909" style="s2">up some design opportunities to really</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.159" end="00:57:59.169" style="s2">bring down those energy capacity costs</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.909" end="00:58:01.959" style="s2">that&#39;s important and so basically</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.169" end="00:58:04.119" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.959" end="00:58:06.069" style="s2">carry these stationary storage devices</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.119" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">around you don&#39;t care about the mass and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.069" end="00:58:09.640" style="s2">the volume so there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:11.799" style="s2">interesting ways in which these</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.640" end="00:58:13.659" style="s2">technologies are being developed another</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.799" end="00:58:15.789" style="s2">important energy storage technology is</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.659" end="00:58:17.649" style="s2">pumped hydro storage now that really</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.789" end="00:58:19.899" style="s2">only makes sense in places where you</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.649" end="00:58:22.839" style="s2">have enough water and where you have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.899" end="00:58:25.749" style="s2">right topographical features where you</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.839" end="00:58:28.059" style="s2">have some reservoir of water elevated</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.749" end="00:58:30.399" style="s2">that can be used for this pumped storage</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.059" end="00:58:32.829" style="s2">site and the way it works is you pump</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.399" end="00:58:36.909" style="s2">water uphill and then later you let it</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.829" end="00:58:38.799" style="s2">run downhill to generate electricity so</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.909" end="00:58:41.489" style="s2">where this makes sense where you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.799" end="00:58:44.679" style="s2">the right conditions water and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.489" end="00:58:47.439" style="s2">topography this is an important</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.679" end="00:58:50.049" style="s2">technology to to adopt and of course</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.439" end="00:58:52.779" style="s2">there I want to make sure to highlight</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.049" end="00:58:54.909" style="s2">that there are many concerns in many</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.779" end="00:58:57.519" style="s2">places about building a hydro facility</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.909" end="00:58:59.169" style="s2">and a hydro reservoir and so we really</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.519" end="00:59:01.239" style="s2">want to take those into account as well</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.169" end="00:59:04.089" style="s2">there can be ecosystem impacts and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.239" end="00:59:06.069" style="s2">impacts on local populations so you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.089" end="00:59:08.739" style="s2">it only really makes sense where you</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.069" end="00:59:11.409" style="s2">have the right conditions and and people</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.739" end="00:59:14.679" style="s2">and ecosystems aren&#39;t negatively</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.409" end="00:59:17.229" style="s2">impacted so the future development</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.679" end="00:59:19.569" style="s2">potential there is somewhat restricted</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.229" end="00:59:22.419" style="s2">by those factors so those are some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.569" end="00:59:25.359" style="s2">the electrochemical storage devices the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.419" end="00:59:28.179" style="s2">batteries and so batteries and Pumped</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.359" end="00:59:30.189" style="s2">hydro storage are some of the important</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.179" end="00:59:31.929" style="s2">storage technologies to keep an eye on</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.189" end="00:59:32.549" style="s2">and as to where things are going to go</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.929" end="00:59:34.140" style="s2">in the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.549" end="00:59:36.719" style="s2">are certainly a lot of room for</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.140" end="00:59:38.759" style="s2">development as I mentioned before we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.719" end="00:59:41.130" style="s2">just starting to get working on</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.759" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">stationary storage devices and in</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.130" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">earnest and there&#39;s more enthusiasm in</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:48.420" style="s2">this area there are many different</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:51.209" style="s2">directions these technologies could go</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.420" end="00:59:53.160" style="s2">in different forms of energy we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.209" end="00:59:54.929" style="s2">store the energy in different forms and</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.160" end="00:59:58.410" style="s2">so I I think there&#39;s a lot of potential</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.929" end="01:00:01.679" style="s2">but the future is uncertain so there you</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.410" end="01:00:04.559" style="s2">know in terms of our portfolio again</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.679" end="01:00:07.079" style="s2">we&#39;d want to diversify our investments</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.559" end="01:00:08.880" style="s2">across a number of different options and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.079" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">I should mention lithium-ion batteries</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.880" end="01:00:13.049" style="s2">again come back to that there is</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:15.150" style="s2">probably a significant room for cost</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.049" end="01:00:17.789" style="s2">reduction and lithium-ion batteries too</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.150" end="01:00:20.819" style="s2">so that&#39;s another technology to keep an</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.789" end="01:00:23.009" style="s2">eye on okay how about nukes nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.819" end="01:00:24.479" style="s2">power you know again people often forget</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.009" end="01:00:27.390" style="s2">about that when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.479" end="01:00:29.670" style="s2">greenhouse gas free power sources but</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.390" end="01:00:31.589" style="s2">hey there&#39;s one that emits almost</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.670" end="01:00:34.140" style="s2">nothing in terms of greenhouse gas I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.589" end="01:00:36.719" style="s2">have a fair big upfront cost but if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.140" end="01:00:37.890" style="s2">look at the energy return on investment</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.719" end="01:00:41.009" style="s2">I mean the things about a hundred to one</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.890" end="01:00:43.170" style="s2">say it gets a very good return on energy</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.009" end="01:00:44.939" style="s2">invested where are we today with nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.170" end="01:00:47.489" style="s2">power and what do you see coming down</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.939" end="01:00:50.429" style="s2">the pike yeah so nuclear fission</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.489" end="01:00:52.949" style="s2">reactors are an important option to look</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.429" end="01:00:56.539" style="s2">at as well so what we&#39;ve seen in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.949" end="01:00:59.579" style="s2">u.s. is that the development of new</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.539" end="01:01:04.019" style="s2">reactors really slowed and essentially</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.579" end="01:01:05.699" style="s2">stopped in recent decades and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.019" end="01:01:08.670" style="s2">there are a couple of possible reasons</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.699" end="01:01:10.499" style="s2">for that but what we see over time with</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.670" end="01:01:12.900" style="s2">nuclear fission reactors we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.499" end="01:01:16.999" style="s2">working on a paper on this right now is</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.900" end="01:01:19.799" style="s2">that the cost actually rose over time so</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.999" end="01:01:21.630" style="s2">if it didn&#39;t follow the kind of learning</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.799" end="01:01:23.759" style="s2">curve we were talking about earlier and</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.630" end="01:01:28.319" style="s2">we think that one of the reasons for</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.759" end="01:01:30.959" style="s2">that Rises the increase in in soft costs</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.319" end="01:01:32.849" style="s2">so that&#39;s basically all of the on-site</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.959" end="01:01:35.939" style="s2">construction costs the permitting the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.849" end="01:01:38.609" style="s2">quality control some of this was in</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.939" end="01:01:41.069" style="s2">response to safety regulations but in</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.609" end="01:01:43.319" style="s2">many cases we think there could be</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.069" end="01:01:45.250" style="s2">opportunities to respond in a different</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.319" end="01:01:48.220" style="s2">way to safety regulations</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.250" end="01:01:51.000" style="s2">and that this cost increase could</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.220" end="01:01:54.490" style="s2">potentially be reversed if we rethink</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.000" end="01:01:57.370" style="s2">how we&#39;re developing and constructing</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.490" end="01:01:59.230" style="s2">these nuclear fission reactors so</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.370" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">basically costs have come up in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.230" end="01:02:06.370" style="s2">in other places costs have not followed</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.280" end="01:02:08.890" style="s2">the same trends and development has</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.370" end="01:02:11.860" style="s2">continued so France as many people may</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.890" end="01:02:16.090" style="s2">know relies a good deal on nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.860" end="01:02:19.720" style="s2">fission for electricity but in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.090" end="01:02:21.700" style="s2">we haven&#39;t seen growth trends in recent</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.720" end="01:02:23.530" style="s2">years so it&#39;s a big question as to</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.700" end="01:02:25.960" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen in the future and</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.530" end="01:02:28.570" style="s2">my thoughts on what could happen are the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.960" end="01:02:31.960" style="s2">following I think there is potential to</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.570" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">find ways to reduce the costs of nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.960" end="01:02:36.010" style="s2">fission and to reduce those soft costs</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:39.850" style="s2">that I talked about one of the ways to</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.010" end="01:02:43.360" style="s2">do that is to possibly to transition to</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.850" end="01:02:46.270" style="s2">small modular reactors where much of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.360" end="01:02:49.720" style="s2">construction is done off-site and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.270" end="01:02:51.700" style="s2">on-site construction requirements are</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.720" end="01:02:55.060" style="s2">much more straightforward and that could</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.700" end="01:02:56.800" style="s2">help drive costs down the other big</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.060" end="01:03:01.030" style="s2">question with nuclear fission of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.800" end="01:03:03.460" style="s2">is what is the public acceptance of it</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.030" end="01:03:06.460" style="s2">and in some places like in Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.460" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">Japan you see that the public acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.460" end="01:03:13.000" style="s2">is low in other places it&#39;s higher and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">so this may be a technology that works</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.000" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">in some places is a good option in some</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:18.520" style="s2">places and not such a good option other</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:20.530" style="s2">places I think we should be bringing</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.520" end="01:03:23.140" style="s2">people into those decisions and having</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.530" end="01:03:25.090" style="s2">conversations about that in places where</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.140" end="01:03:28.530" style="s2">it makes sense then this can be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.090" end="01:03:30.940" style="s2">contributor to a low-carbon electricity</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.530" end="01:03:33.810" style="s2">there are a couple of other issues that</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.940" end="01:03:36.850" style="s2">we need to think about as well like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.810" end="01:03:39.010" style="s2">long-term storage of nuclear waste and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.850" end="01:03:41.790" style="s2">of course there&#39;s always the question of</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.010" end="01:03:44.580" style="s2">nuclear weapons proliferation</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.790" end="01:03:46.110" style="s2">and certainly continuing to focus on</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.580" end="01:03:48.180" style="s2">preventing nuclear weapons proliferation</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.110" end="01:03:49.980" style="s2">so those are some of the challenges but</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.180" end="01:03:53.400" style="s2">also some of the opportunities with</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.980" end="01:03:55.010" style="s2">nuclear fission technology yeah when I</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.400" end="01:03:57.810" style="s2">think about the algebra you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.010" end="01:03:59.700" style="s2">multi-factor equation and if we were to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.810" end="01:04:01.800" style="s2">say triple the amount of nuclear we had</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.700" end="01:04:03.810" style="s2">in the world that would provide a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.800" end="01:04:05.520" style="s2">good sized base load which makes a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.810" end="01:04:08.520" style="s2">of the other problems much less pressing</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.520" end="01:04:11.700" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.520" end="01:04:14.070" style="s2">fission could be used as a base load</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.700" end="01:04:15.810" style="s2">technology and the question is really</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.070" end="01:04:18.120" style="s2">about those three factors that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.810" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">mentioned are let&#39;s say for actually the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.120" end="01:04:22.920" style="s2">answer that question will be determined</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:26.610" style="s2">by those four factors one is social</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.920" end="01:04:29.730" style="s2">acceptance the other is the costs and if</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.610" end="01:04:33.090" style="s2">we can bring those soft costs down the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.730" end="01:04:36.570" style="s2">other is what we do with long term waste</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.090" end="01:04:38.760" style="s2">management and then finally the question</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.570" end="01:04:41.010" style="s2">of nuclear weapons proliferation so</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.760" end="01:04:43.470" style="s2">those are four important factors to keep</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.010" end="01:04:46.110" style="s2">an eye on yep that sounds good</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.470" end="01:04:49.620" style="s2">one last technology before we move on</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.110" end="01:04:51.090" style="s2">what about carbon atmospheric removal is</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.620" end="01:04:52.470" style="s2">that a thing is that gonna really happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.090" end="01:04:54.660" style="s2">is there a chance for it where&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.470" end="01:04:57.660" style="s2">stand yeah again this is a technology</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.660" end="01:04:59.910" style="s2">that I think we should be investing some</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.660" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">amount in there are some challenges</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.910" end="01:05:06.720" style="s2">having to do with coordination again and</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:08.420" style="s2">public acceptance and some of these</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.720" end="01:05:12.060" style="s2">challenges that we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.420" end="01:05:14.130" style="s2">regarding you know these not in my</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.060" end="01:05:16.380" style="s2">backyard kinds of challenges now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.130" end="01:05:19.770" style="s2">saying move it&#39;s too early to see if</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.380" end="01:05:21.510" style="s2">that will really be the determining</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.770" end="01:05:23.550" style="s2">factor for carbon capture and storage</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.510" end="01:05:25.260" style="s2">but these coordination challenges and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.550" end="01:05:26.910" style="s2">public acceptance challenges are ones</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.260" end="01:05:28.400" style="s2">that could certainly be important</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.910" end="01:05:32.900" style="s2">factors but what we&#39;ve seen so far</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.400" end="01:05:35.100" style="s2">limiting investment in this technology</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.900" end="01:05:37.620" style="s2">which which may have to do with</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.100" end="01:05:40.050" style="s2">investors perception of those two</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.620" end="01:05:41.970" style="s2">factors that I just mentioned is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.050" end="01:05:44.010" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t been as much appetite to</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.970" end="01:05:46.320" style="s2">take on the risk of investing in these</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.010" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">large projects and there have been</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.320" end="01:05:50.720" style="s2">successful demonstration projects but</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:52.710" style="s2">the technology really hasn&#39;t taken off</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.720" end="01:05:54.520" style="s2">there are a couple of other challenges</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.710" end="01:05:57.820" style="s2">that still have to be addressed so</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.520" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">is in looking at what are the possible</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.820" end="01:06:03.310" style="s2">storage sites I&#39;m in what form do you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:05.110" style="s2">store the carbon dioxide ideally we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.310" end="01:06:08.770" style="s2">like to be able to convert it to a solid</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.110" end="01:06:13.000" style="s2">form and one of the reasons for that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.770" end="01:06:15.040" style="s2">that even a very small leakage rate for</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.000" end="01:06:16.780" style="s2">carbon dioxide could lead to a huge</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.040" end="01:06:18.300" style="s2">problem down the road because carbon</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.780" end="01:06:20.890" style="s2">dioxide once it&#39;s in the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.300" end="01:06:22.690" style="s2">sticks around for hundreds of years so</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.890" end="01:06:26.740" style="s2">even if you have very small leaks over</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.690" end="01:06:28.630" style="s2">time you get to a very big climate</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.740" end="01:06:30.850" style="s2">problem so that&#39;s something that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.630" end="01:06:33.610" style="s2">like to avoid so researchers are looking</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.850" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">at turning carbon dioxide into a solid</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.610" end="01:06:38.200" style="s2">form it&#39;s not an easy thing to do what</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:41.470" style="s2">you&#39;re doing there is trying to drive a</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.200" end="01:06:43.690" style="s2">mineralization reaction which isn&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.470" end="01:06:46.570" style="s2">that easy so I guess the bottom line is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.690" end="01:06:48.370" style="s2">carbon capture and storage is certainly</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.570" end="01:06:51.190" style="s2">something we should be looking at it may</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.370" end="01:06:53.680" style="s2">end up being more of an niche technology</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.190" end="01:06:55.840" style="s2">for certain niche applications like</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.680" end="01:06:58.630" style="s2">industrial emissions that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.840" end="01:07:00.430" style="s2">that could turn out to be how this</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.630" end="01:07:02.140" style="s2">technology is used I think we should</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.430" end="01:07:04.390" style="s2">keep it in the portfolio of technologies</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.140" end="01:07:06.610" style="s2">that we&#39;re investing in trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.390" end="01:07:08.680" style="s2">improve okay it&#39;s a good thought now I</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.610" end="01:07:10.360" style="s2">will skip over with my last few nerdy</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.680" end="01:07:12.610" style="s2">topics because I think it&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.360" end="01:07:15.100" style="s2">relevant for this carbon removal and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.610" end="01:07:17.500" style="s2">sequestration issue into the policy</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.100" end="01:07:19.840" style="s2">space right we have a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.500" end="01:07:22.690" style="s2">different knobs that as a social</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.840" end="01:07:25.750" style="s2">operating system we could set to help us</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.690" end="01:07:27.790" style="s2">move towards carbon neutrality before we</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.750" end="01:07:29.170" style="s2">meltdown in some of the ones we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.790" end="01:07:31.570" style="s2">talked about before are things like</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.170" end="01:07:34.360" style="s2">portfolio mandates where you know just</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.570" end="01:07:36.490" style="s2">by regulation we say that utilities must</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.360" end="01:07:39.850" style="s2">convert X percentage of their capacity</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.490" end="01:07:41.920" style="s2">to renewables cap-and-trade where</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.850" end="01:07:44.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a complicated market-based</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.920" end="01:07:46.720" style="s2">system and greenhouse gas emissions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.560" end="01:07:48.490" style="s2">then things like carbon taxes what do</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.720" end="01:07:49.900" style="s2">you think about those policy things and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.490" end="01:07:51.550" style="s2">what else do we have in the policy space</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.900" end="01:07:53.500" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.550" end="01:07:55.900" style="s2">so there are a handful of different</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.500" end="01:07:57.640" style="s2">policy instruments that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.900" end="01:08:00.100" style="s2">choose from I mean some of the major</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.640" end="01:08:02.560" style="s2">ones are government funding for research</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.100" end="01:08:04.290" style="s2">and development and for really all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.560" end="01:08:08.850" style="s2">the technologies that we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.290" end="01:08:10.800" style="s2">about there is a need for further basic</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.850" end="01:08:12.960" style="s2">research and publicly funded research</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.800" end="01:08:15.090" style="s2">that could really go a long way in</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.960" end="01:08:16.920" style="s2">addressing some of the specific problems</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.090" end="01:08:19.080" style="s2">and challenges that still remain for</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.920" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">those technologies we talked about so</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.080" end="01:08:23.310" style="s2">that&#39;s one set of policies that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.120" end="01:08:25.620" style="s2">important and then the other policies</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.310" end="01:08:29.280" style="s2">are ones that I would we can put all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.620" end="01:08:31.770" style="s2">them into one large bucket which has the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.280" end="01:08:34.560" style="s2">label market stimulating policies for</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.770" end="01:08:37.410" style="s2">low carbon technologies so these are</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.560" end="01:08:41.270" style="s2">things like various kinds of incentives</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.410" end="01:08:44.720" style="s2">so subsidies for low carbon energy</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.270" end="01:08:47.310" style="s2">feed-in tariffs are guaranteed prices or</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.720" end="01:08:48.930" style="s2">regulations that mandate a certain</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.310" end="01:08:50.970" style="s2">amount of renewable energy for example</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.930" end="01:08:54.170" style="s2">one example is the renewable portfolio</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.970" end="01:08:56.490" style="s2">standard that you see in some US states</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.170" end="01:08:59.160" style="s2">so those are all market stimulating</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.490" end="01:09:02.339" style="s2">policies but also carbon taxes and a</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.160" end="01:09:04.140" style="s2">cap-and-trade system could also fall</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.339" end="01:09:05.720" style="s2">under those markets stimulating policies</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.140" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">those are a little different in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.720" end="01:09:10.440" style="s2">you&#39;re not picking individual</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:13.890" style="s2">technologies to target but rather</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.440" end="01:09:17.580" style="s2">targeting the carbon emissions coming</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.890" end="01:09:19.620" style="s2">from those technologies but but those</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.580" end="01:09:20.970" style="s2">can also fall under that category so we</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.620" end="01:09:24.060" style="s2">have a range of different instruments</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.970" end="01:09:26.940" style="s2">that we can use and they&#39;ve been shown</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.060" end="01:09:28.859" style="s2">to be successful yeah though it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.940" end="01:09:30.900" style="s2">we don&#39;t seem to have much will to do it</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.859" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">you know the name very people are trying</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.900" end="01:09:35.430" style="s2">cap-and-trade and truthfully I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:37.109" style="s2">fairly strong economics background and</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.430" end="01:09:38.850" style="s2">when I first heard about cap-and-trade I</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.109" end="01:09:41.850" style="s2">said ah this is obviously the right</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.850" end="01:09:45.000" style="s2">answer because you take out the most</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.850" end="01:09:46.560" style="s2">cost-effective carbon first right the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.000" end="01:09:48.720" style="s2">idea is that everybody bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.560" end="01:09:51.030" style="s2">have rights to emit carbon those rights</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.720" end="01:09:52.680" style="s2">go downhill every year people trade them</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.030" end="01:09:54.120" style="s2">amongst themselves so carbon that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.680" end="01:09:56.430" style="s2">they got getting rid of gets rid of</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.120" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">early etc but unfortunately there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.430" end="01:09:59.970" style="s2">of problems with it like who gets those</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:01.380" style="s2">credits right you can imagine any</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.970" end="01:10:03.390" style="s2">society that has even a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.380" end="01:10:05.070" style="s2">corruption it&#39;s gonna be driven by</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.390" end="01:10:07.350" style="s2">political corruption to a large degree</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.070" end="01:10:09.120" style="s2">so we saw in Europe they set the caps</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.350" end="01:10:11.580" style="s2">too high and basically didn&#39;t do jack</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:14.100" style="s2"> price dropped is almost zero so it</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.580" end="01:10:16.260" style="s2">had no effect etc so I&#39;ve come around to</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.100" end="01:10:18.120" style="s2">believe very strongly that this is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.260" end="01:10:21.000" style="s2">right economic</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.120" end="01:10:24.540" style="s2">for carbon reduction which is a carbon</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.000" end="01:10:27.300" style="s2">tax which is set relatively high say 30</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.540" end="01:10:30.660" style="s2">or 40 dollars a carbon tonne equivalent</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.300" end="01:10:34.380" style="s2">today and is set statutorily to increase</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.660" end="01:10:38.010" style="s2">linearly to $200 per tonne in 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.380" end="01:10:40.530" style="s2">and continue thereafter further this</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.010" end="01:10:43.500" style="s2">carbon tax will be refunded to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.530" end="01:10:45.900" style="s2">populace per capita after a small amount</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.500" end="01:10:48.150" style="s2">may be later a larger amount is used to</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.900" end="01:10:51.030" style="s2">pay for carbon sequestration</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.150" end="01:10:53.430" style="s2">so first what use of the tax is to</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.030" end="01:10:56.490" style="s2">actually pay people the exact reverse of</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.430" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">the tax rate for taking carbon solidly</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.490" end="01:10:59.880" style="s2">out of the atmosphere and no</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.320" end="01:11:01.530" style="s2">but you know the real deal I hear the</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.880" end="01:11:04.020" style="s2">pier the bricks I can count them and</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.530" end="01:11:06.090" style="s2">then the rest goes back per capita to</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.020" end="01:11:08.340" style="s2">each individual now the beauty of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.090" end="01:11:10.620" style="s2">is you don&#39;t have the political kick</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.340" end="01:11:13.230" style="s2">back because the average use of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.620" end="01:11:15.390" style="s2">greenhouse gases is quite a bit higher</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.230" end="01:11:17.010" style="s2">than the median use what does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.390" end="01:11:19.410" style="s2">it means that the majority and a</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.010" end="01:11:20.940" style="s2">significant majority of people in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.410" end="01:11:23.550" style="s2">country like the United States will</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.940" end="01:11:25.800" style="s2">actually be economically ahead if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.550" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">got a per capita redistribution of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.800" end="01:11:30.840" style="s2">carbon tax and yet every decision they</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:32.940" style="s2">make at the micro economic level is</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.840" end="01:11:35.580" style="s2">fully informed by the weight of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.940" end="01:11:37.500" style="s2">carbon tax so you know their gas still</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.580" end="01:11:39.840" style="s2">costs twice as much so they&#39;re gonna use</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.500" end="01:11:41.790" style="s2">less gas even though in the aggregate</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.840" end="01:11:44.220" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get all that money back</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.790" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">again at the end of the month so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.220" end="01:11:50.100" style="s2">been thinking about this for a while and</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:52.610" style="s2">I can see no better powerful stimulus to</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.100" end="01:11:56.190" style="s2">our innovators to our own conservation</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.610" end="01:11:58.350" style="s2">instincts to everything by a strong and</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.190" end="01:12:01.080" style="s2">rapidly increasing carbon tax that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.350" end="01:12:04.430" style="s2">refunded per capita on a monthly basis</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.080" end="01:12:07.890" style="s2">yeah I mean you know I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.430" end="01:12:10.500" style="s2">important issues that that your proposal</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.890" end="01:12:13.140" style="s2">will deal with is the otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.500" end="01:12:15.810" style="s2">regressive nature of a carbon tax or the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.140" end="01:12:17.850" style="s2">inequitable impacts of a carbon tax you</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.810" end="01:12:19.230" style="s2">know that&#39;s one of the concerns is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.850" end="01:12:22.140" style="s2">if you have a carbon tax that will</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.230" end="01:12:25.140" style="s2">affect lower-income households and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.140" end="01:12:26.760" style="s2">people you know more and so with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.140" end="01:12:29.310" style="s2">plan that you&#39;re talking about you could</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.760" end="01:12:30.380" style="s2">you could begin to deal with with some</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.310" end="01:12:33.679" style="s2">of those issues</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.380" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">I think certainly a carbon tax could</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.679" end="01:12:37.969" style="s2">work a couple thoughts on that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:39.739" style="s2">really important and you touched on this</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.969" end="01:12:41.810" style="s2">it&#39;s important what the actual value is</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.739" end="01:12:43.880" style="s2">and whenever anyone says they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.810" end="01:12:46.850" style="s2">supporting a carbon tax I always come</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.880" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">back and ask okay what&#39;s what is the tax</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.850" end="01:12:50.780" style="s2">what&#39;s the value what value does it</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:54.170" style="s2">start at what happens to it over time</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.780" end="01:12:56.179" style="s2">and once we start to get up to $100 a</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.170" end="01:12:59.030" style="s2">ton that&#39;s when you really can start to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.179" end="01:13:01.760" style="s2">see significant changes we know this</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.030" end="01:13:04.280" style="s2">because you can simply look at the cost</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.760" end="01:13:06.170" style="s2">of energy and the carbon intensity of</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.280" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">energy of different options out there</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.170" end="01:13:10.070" style="s2">and you could see how they change</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:12.469" style="s2">relative to one another with different</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.070" end="01:13:15.190" style="s2">levels of a carbon tax and we know that</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.469" end="01:13:18.409" style="s2">you know we can see those changes and</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.190" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve done this analysis and $100 a ton</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.409" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">is and you&#39;ll start you&#39;ll see things</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:25.460" style="s2">change even at a lower level but $100 a</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:27.320" style="s2">ton is when you can start to see these</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.460" end="01:13:29.449" style="s2">shifts and the energy supply</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.320" end="01:13:31.909" style="s2">technologies and really that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.449" end="01:13:33.980" style="s2">needed you have to get fossil fuels out</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.909" end="01:13:37.130" style="s2">of the energy system or to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.980" end="01:13:40.070" style="s2">they remain capture the carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.130" end="01:13:42.980" style="s2">and ideally turn this to a solid form</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.070" end="01:13:46.550" style="s2">that&#39;s still a technology that needs</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.980" end="01:13:49.880" style="s2">some development so you know but yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.550" end="01:13:52.639" style="s2">mean I think a significant sizable</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.880" end="01:13:54.020" style="s2">carbon tax could be a good way to go of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.639" end="01:13:57.500" style="s2">course the question is will people</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.020" end="01:13:59.030" style="s2">accept it will they support it and some</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.500" end="01:14:01.850" style="s2">of my political science colleagues have</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.030" end="01:14:04.070" style="s2">looked in the into this in detail one</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.850" end="01:14:05.960" style="s2">colleague of mine she&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.070" end="01:14:07.550" style="s2">former student of mine Leah Stokes at</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.960" end="01:14:09.400" style="s2">University of California Santa Barbara</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.550" end="01:14:11.780" style="s2">is doing some great work in this area</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.400" end="01:14:13.670" style="s2">but anyway you know it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.780" end="01:14:15.469" style="s2">look at what what do people want I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.670" end="01:14:18.050" style="s2">saying that that can&#39;t change over time</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.469" end="01:14:20.090" style="s2">but we want to pay attention to what is</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.050" end="01:14:22.550" style="s2">acceptable to people what are they going</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.090" end="01:14:25.670" style="s2">to support and some of the studies out</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.550" end="01:14:27.860" style="s2">there are suggesting that people like to</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.670" end="01:14:29.900" style="s2">they don&#39;t really like attack so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.860" end="01:14:33.230" style="s2">we could reframe your policy in such a</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.900" end="01:14:35.210" style="s2">way that it&#39;s you know an environmental</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.230" end="01:14:37.250" style="s2">rebate because they&#39;re getting something</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.210" end="01:14:40.100" style="s2">back but you know that idea of paying</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.250" end="01:14:42.739" style="s2">something is less popular than the idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.100" end="01:14:43.409" style="s2">of investing in something and getting</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.739" end="01:14:46.139" style="s2">something back</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.409" end="01:14:48.179" style="s2">so you know when we talk about investing</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.139" end="01:14:52.439" style="s2">in solar and wind these can be more</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.179" end="01:14:55.260" style="s2">popular policies actually than taxing</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.439" end="01:14:59.340" style="s2">carbon emissions and that perhaps is</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.260" end="01:15:01.409" style="s2">rooted in human psychology but I mean at</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.340" end="01:15:03.059" style="s2">the but at the end of the day I guess</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.409" end="01:15:05.610" style="s2">what I would say is that we have these</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.059" end="01:15:07.050" style="s2">energy supply technologies they have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.610" end="01:15:09.419" style="s2">certain amount of carbon emissions</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.050" end="01:15:10.739" style="s2">associated with them they&#39;re they cost a</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.419" end="01:15:14.429" style="s2">certain amount they have a certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.739" end="01:15:16.619" style="s2">amount of scalability and we can use a</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.429" end="01:15:18.929" style="s2">collection of instruments a carbon tax</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.619" end="01:15:21.739" style="s2">would work a carbon cap would work it</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.929" end="01:15:24.329" style="s2">would lead to a price on carbon</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.739" end="01:15:27.329" style="s2">different technology specific</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.329" end="01:15:29.189" style="s2">instruments would work apply to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.329" end="01:15:31.380" style="s2">handful of different technologies we</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.189" end="01:15:35.219" style="s2">have we can use a combination of all of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.380" end="01:15:37.559" style="s2">these but the idea is to it all of these</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.219" end="01:15:40.800" style="s2">essentially put a price on carbon they</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.559" end="01:15:43.169" style="s2">bring in that external cost of carbon</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.800" end="01:15:45.329" style="s2">emissions and climate change and bring</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.169" end="01:15:48.479" style="s2">that into the price that consumers see</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.329" end="01:15:50.880" style="s2">and another it&#39;s getting a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.479" end="01:15:52.559" style="s2">kind of technical and I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.880" end="01:15:55.380" style="s2">much we want to go into these details</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.559" end="01:15:57.959" style="s2">but one of the challenges with setting</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.380" end="01:15:59.249" style="s2">the right carbon price is actually to</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.959" end="01:16:01.949" style="s2">address some of the questions we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.249" end="01:16:03.840" style="s2">covering which is how our technology is</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.949" end="01:16:05.699" style="s2">changing with time because at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.840" end="01:16:08.999" style="s2">the day if what you want to do is to</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.699" end="01:16:11.550" style="s2">reach a certain emissions target all of</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.999" end="01:16:13.289" style="s2">these policies need to be informed by an</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.550" end="01:16:14.909" style="s2">understanding of the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.289" end="01:16:17.639" style="s2">technological change if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.909" end="01:16:21.179" style="s2">technology changing and cost by an order</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.639" end="01:16:22.709" style="s2">of magnitude over 10 years that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.179" end="01:16:25.650" style="s2">something you really want to take into</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.709" end="01:16:29.999" style="s2">account in your models and use that to</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.650" end="01:16:32.909" style="s2">inform policy so I guess I would tweak</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.999" end="01:16:34.829" style="s2">your proposal a little bit I think a</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.909" end="01:16:36.539" style="s2">carbon tax where it makes sense where</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.829" end="01:16:38.969" style="s2">it&#39;s socially acceptable and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.539" end="01:16:40.739" style="s2">we we have a significant carbon tax in</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.969" end="01:16:43.499" style="s2">Sweden you know I think that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.739" end="01:16:45.510" style="s2">to go forward with that but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.499" end="01:16:47.130" style="s2">probably also going to need a number of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.510" end="01:16:50.610" style="s2">these other policy instruments for</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.130" end="01:16:52.919" style="s2">investing in government-funded R&amp;D but</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.610" end="01:16:56.309" style="s2">also these market stimulating policies</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.919" end="01:16:56.710" style="s2">that target options that look like they</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.309" end="01:16:58.510" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.710" end="01:16:59.950" style="s2">very that you know where while the</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.510" end="01:17:01.510" style="s2">evidence suggests that they could be</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.950" end="01:17:03.940" style="s2">very important for addressing climate</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.510" end="01:17:06.340" style="s2">change going forward I think I probably</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.940" end="01:17:07.840" style="s2">is the right answer there is no one</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.340" end="01:17:09.340" style="s2">answer we&#39;re all looking for the Silver</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.840" end="01:17:12.400" style="s2">Bullet but it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.340" end="01:17:15.219" style="s2">coordination you&#39;ve mentioned several</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.400" end="01:17:18.100" style="s2">times through the day that our research</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.219" end="01:17:20.080" style="s2">priorities are real important and I saw</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.100" end="01:17:22.810" style="s2">that you&#39;d recently co-authored a paper</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.080" end="01:17:24.820" style="s2">on that you know what are the four</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.810" end="01:17:26.800" style="s2">research priorities for making progress</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.820" end="01:17:28.180" style="s2">on climate could you give us your</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.800" end="01:17:30.550" style="s2">thoughts on where our research</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.180" end="01:17:32.620" style="s2">priorities ought to be yeah sure so</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.550" end="01:17:35.290" style="s2">there are a number of really important</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.620" end="01:17:37.719" style="s2">areas I guess I&#39;ll start with technology</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.290" end="01:17:39.489" style="s2">specific priorities and which</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.719" end="01:17:41.460" style="s2">technologies I think we could focus on</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.489" end="01:17:44.440" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll go into some other</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.460" end="01:17:47.710" style="s2">priorities so in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.440" end="01:17:50.230" style="s2">technologies certainly bringing down</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.710" end="01:17:53.290" style="s2">energy storage costs is really important</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.230" end="01:17:57.430" style="s2">and there I&#39;m referring to not just</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.290" end="01:17:59.860" style="s2">batteries but also other kinds of energy</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.430" end="01:18:03.300" style="s2">storage like technologies figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.860" end="01:18:06.730" style="s2">how to draw from a more diverse and</p>

<p begin="01:18:32.500" end="01:18:38.890" style="s2">possible but then also to find ways to</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.580" end="01:18:41.140" style="s2">maybe generate and produce low carbon</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.890" end="01:18:42.400" style="s2">fuels to meet the portion of the demand</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.140" end="01:18:44.410" style="s2">that can&#39;t be met through</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.400" end="01:18:48.580" style="s2">electrification so I I kind of lumped</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.410" end="01:18:50.560" style="s2">these under energy storage plus so the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.580" end="01:18:53.260" style="s2">physical batteries and then all of these</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.560" end="01:18:55.120" style="s2">other ways of managing and matching</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.260" end="01:18:57.880" style="s2">supply and demand I think that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.120" end="01:19:00.400" style="s2">research area and really important so</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.880" end="01:19:02.800" style="s2">that&#39;s one certainly bringing down the</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.400" end="01:19:04.780" style="s2">cost of solar energy and specifically</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.800" end="01:19:07.420" style="s2">the soft costs of solar energy is</p>

<p begin="01:19:31.229" end="01:19:36.449" style="s2">should keep an eye on that and keep</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.909" end="01:19:39.139" style="s2">pushing on that now you know if I were</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.449" end="01:19:42.539" style="s2">to make allocations across those areas</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.139" end="01:19:44.129" style="s2">I&#39;d use a portfolio model and you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.539" end="01:19:45.779" style="s2">different ones would receive more</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.129" end="01:19:47.719" style="s2">research funding than others but those</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.779" end="01:19:50.939" style="s2">are some important ones oh and also</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.719" end="01:19:53.429" style="s2">continuing to work on electric vehicles</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.939" end="01:19:55.709" style="s2">so that includes battery electric</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.429" end="01:19:58.559" style="s2">vehicles as well as fuel cell vehicles</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.709" end="01:20:00.479" style="s2">and then also transportation technology</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.559" end="01:20:04.829" style="s2">and software that allows us to match</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.479" end="01:20:07.379" style="s2">vehicles to the kinds of trips and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.829" end="01:20:09.799" style="s2">features needed for a particular</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.379" end="01:20:13.319" style="s2">transportation service and then finally</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.799" end="01:20:15.179" style="s2">developing technology that allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.319" end="01:20:18.299" style="s2">seamlessly provide transportation</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.179" end="01:20:20.819" style="s2">services to people combining electric</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.299" end="01:20:23.909" style="s2">vehicles with public transit and other</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.819" end="01:20:25.799" style="s2">low-carbon forms of transportation so</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.909" end="01:20:27.809" style="s2">those are some technology areas that I</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.799" end="01:20:29.999" style="s2">think are really important in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.809" end="01:20:35.399" style="s2">general themes I guess I&#39;ll highlight a</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.999" end="01:20:39.379" style="s2">few one is this issue of soft technology</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.399" end="01:20:43.709" style="s2">and soft costs and just in general</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.379" end="01:20:47.669" style="s2">finding ways to match a low-carbon</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.709" end="01:20:49.559" style="s2">supply to energy demand and to shape the</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.669" end="01:20:51.949" style="s2">energy demand so that goes beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.559" end="01:20:54.689" style="s2">specific example that I gave before in</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.949" end="01:20:57.329" style="s2">managing variable renewable energy and</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.689" end="01:20:59.629" style="s2">matching that to demand to looking at</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.329" end="01:21:02.159" style="s2">you know the example from transportation</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.629" end="01:21:04.979" style="s2">matching transportation services to</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.159" end="01:21:07.229" style="s2">people&#39;s needs but I think we can use</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.979" end="01:21:10.559" style="s2">this as a concept more generally to look</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.229" end="01:21:12.599" style="s2">at industrial energy services and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.559" end="01:21:14.819" style="s2">know heating and cooling energy services</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.599" end="01:21:17.879" style="s2">so kind of looking at using soft</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.819" end="01:21:21.419" style="s2">technology to match supply to demand and</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.879" end="01:21:23.159" style="s2">then also you know across the technology</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.419" end="01:21:25.350" style="s2">of the example technology exam</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.159" end="01:21:28.400" style="s2">as I gave I mentioned soft cost</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.350" end="01:21:32.190" style="s2">specifically so that&#39;s the cost of labor</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.400" end="01:21:34.920" style="s2">installation maintenance and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.190" end="01:21:37.500" style="s2">category of cost that hasn&#39;t seen as</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.920" end="01:21:39.780" style="s2">much improvement as it could across many</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.500" end="01:21:41.429" style="s2">different low-carbon technology so</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.780" end="01:21:43.679" style="s2">that&#39;s specifically something that I</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.429" end="01:21:45.150" style="s2">think would be important to look at one</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.679" end="01:21:47.580" style="s2">other area I want to highlight is</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.150" end="01:21:49.639" style="s2">artificial intelligence I&#39;ll just give</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.580" end="01:21:52.440" style="s2">one trivial example which is</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.639" end="01:21:53.730" style="s2">self-driving cars the algorithms that</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.440" end="01:21:56.520" style="s2">are being developed for self-driving</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.730" end="01:21:59.190" style="s2">cars aren&#39;t focusing as much as they</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.520" end="01:22:01.590" style="s2">could on energy efficiency reducing</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.190" end="01:22:03.840" style="s2">energy demand per trip but then also we</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.590" end="01:22:07.080" style="s2">should be thinking about how do we use</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.840" end="01:22:10.320" style="s2">automation of vehicles and other</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.080" end="01:22:12.510" style="s2">automation to make our resource use more</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.320" end="01:22:15.500" style="s2">efficient you know so in transportation</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.510" end="01:22:18.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a concern that automation could</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.500" end="01:22:21.060" style="s2">double you know or greatly increase</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.710" end="01:22:23.340" style="s2">transportation energy demand it could</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.060" end="01:22:26.400" style="s2">also cause the trend to go in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.340" end="01:22:28.230" style="s2">opposite direction and my point is we</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.400" end="01:22:31.050" style="s2">need to be deliberately researching</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.230" end="01:22:32.370" style="s2">these different options and try to you</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.050" end="01:22:35.449" style="s2">know if we care about climate change</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.370" end="01:22:38.610" style="s2">which I obviously do you know try to</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.449" end="01:22:40.760" style="s2">understand how we can use automation for</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.610" end="01:22:43.949" style="s2">benefit in order to bring about</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.760" end="01:22:46.139" style="s2">emissions reduction and decarbonisation</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.949" end="01:22:48.270" style="s2">of transportation so those are a couple</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.139" end="01:22:49.590" style="s2">of general themes yeah well when I</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.270" end="01:22:51.210" style="s2">become president you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.590" end="01:22:56.520" style="s2">available believe my Secretary of Energy</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.210" end="01:23:00.179" style="s2">sure there&#39;s one more can I say one more</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.520" end="01:23:01.650" style="s2">sure okay so another theme that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.179" end="01:23:04.260" style="s2">important and this is actually one that</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.650" end="01:23:06.600" style="s2">I&#39;m going to be working on with some</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.260" end="01:23:09.420" style="s2">colleagues at the Santa Fe Institute in</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.600" end="01:23:11.790" style="s2">a small working group next month and</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.420" end="01:23:15.270" style="s2">that&#39;s on thinking about how the</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.790" end="01:23:18.060" style="s2">decisions we make today will or will not</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.270" end="01:23:22.070" style="s2">allow us to reach deep decarbonization</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.060" end="01:23:25.679" style="s2">path targets one of the problems that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.070" end="01:23:28.320" style="s2">and earlier is a problem that came out</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.679" end="01:23:30.270" style="s2">of some research we did and this was</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.320" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">published recently in the journal Joule</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.270" end="01:23:35.460" style="s2">on the energy storage requirements of</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:38.730" style="s2">almost entirely on solar and wind energy</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.460" end="01:23:41.010" style="s2">and what we see there is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.730" end="01:23:43.470" style="s2">basically if we go down this path we</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.010" end="01:23:46.890" style="s2">need to be thinking about ways to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.470" end="01:23:48.480" style="s2">able to address these large unexpected</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.890" end="01:23:50.670" style="s2">shortage events and solar and wind</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.480" end="01:23:53.850" style="s2">energy and be developing the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.670" end="01:23:56.070" style="s2">technologies for that ultimate goal now</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.850" end="01:23:58.680" style="s2">even though we&#39;re far from you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.070" end="01:24:00.930" style="s2">using eighty percent renewable energy or</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.680" end="01:24:03.420" style="s2">more we need to be working on that now</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.930" end="01:24:06.720" style="s2">and then we also need to be giving</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.420" end="01:24:08.760" style="s2">ourselves retaining the option to reach</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.720" end="01:24:10.380" style="s2">deep decarbonisation targets in</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.760" end="01:24:12.690" style="s2">different ways so basically what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.380" end="01:24:15.780" style="s2">saying is we should be researching and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.690" end="01:24:18.600" style="s2">understanding now what kinds of policies</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.780" end="01:24:20.760" style="s2">are needed to allow us to retain</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.600" end="01:24:22.800" style="s2">different options so if we think of this</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.760" end="01:24:24.450" style="s2">as a decision tree you know we retain</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.800" end="01:24:26.580" style="s2">certain branches of the decision tree</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.450" end="01:24:28.410" style="s2">through our investment decisions and our</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.580" end="01:24:30.510" style="s2">policies and we want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.410" end="01:24:33.180" style="s2">we can get to these deep decarbonisation</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.510" end="01:24:35.520" style="s2">targets and be deliberate about that</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.180" end="01:24:36.890" style="s2">already now so many states have very</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.520" end="01:24:39.120" style="s2">ambitious</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.890" end="01:24:41.520" style="s2">decarbonisation targets by mid-century</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.120" end="01:24:45.870" style="s2">for example New Mexico recently adopted</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.520" end="01:24:47.970" style="s2">one new york state california both have</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.870" end="01:24:50.700" style="s2">very aggressive decarbonisation targets</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.970" end="01:24:53.790" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.700" end="01:24:56.580" style="s2">how the policies we adopt now give us</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.790" end="01:24:58.080" style="s2">the options that we need and take into</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.580" end="01:25:00.510" style="s2">account some of the uncertainties that</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.080" end="01:25:02.730" style="s2">are there in order to reach those deep</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.510" end="01:25:04.920" style="s2">decarbonisation targets yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.730" end="01:25:06.900" style="s2">that&#39;s critical as a society that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.920" end="01:25:09.330" style="s2">be thinking about that but that we be</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.900" end="01:25:10.590" style="s2">thinking about it realistically one of</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.330" end="01:25:13.110" style="s2">the things that really pissed me off</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.590" end="01:25:15.390" style="s2">about climate change and thinking is how</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.110" end="01:25:17.060" style="s2">a lot of what I call magical thinking</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.390" end="01:25:19.650" style="s2">has been floating around recently</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.060" end="01:25:22.410" style="s2">exactly opposite of the kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.650" end="01:25:25.890" style="s2">you just laid out for instance Bernie</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.410" end="01:25:28.050" style="s2">Sanders a guy I supported in 2016 right</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.890" end="01:25:31.740" style="s2">on his website under his climate change</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.050" end="01:25:34.770" style="s2">policy he puts out as his goal reaching</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.740" end="01:25:40.050" style="s2">100% renewable energy for electricity</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.770" end="01:25:42.450" style="s2">and transportation no later than 2030 I</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.050" end="01:25:45.480" style="s2">mean that&#39;s total horseshit</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.450" end="01:25:46.650" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly happen yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.480" end="01:25:48.980" style="s2">think you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.650" end="01:25:51.300" style="s2">I have a couple comments on that I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.980" end="01:25:54.690" style="s2">really what we want to keep our eyes on</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.300" end="01:25:58.489" style="s2">there as a goal is decarbonisation so</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.690" end="01:26:01.110" style="s2">net zero emissions energy systems is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.489" end="01:26:03.800" style="s2">technical term I guess or the jargon</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.110" end="01:26:06.030" style="s2">that use right so that could come from</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.800" end="01:26:08.130" style="s2">renewable sources it may be largely</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.030" end="01:26:10.679" style="s2">solar and wind energy but also from</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.130" end="01:26:13.320" style="s2">other sources like hydro in places where</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.679" end="01:26:15.060" style="s2">it already exists nuclear fission and</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.320" end="01:26:17.190" style="s2">you know that could come through</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.060" end="01:26:19.320" style="s2">electrification as well as producing</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.190" end="01:26:20.550" style="s2">some low carbon fuels like hydrogen</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.320" end="01:26:23.159" style="s2">which is an important one to keep</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.550" end="01:26:27.600" style="s2">working on that&#39;s actually an another</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.159" end="01:26:29.550" style="s2">research priority there but yeah so we</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.600" end="01:26:31.860" style="s2">want to be aiming for net zero emissions</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.550" end="01:26:33.840" style="s2">energy systems and it could be that</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.860" end="01:26:35.850" style="s2">that&#39;s largely coming from renewable</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.840" end="01:26:39.630" style="s2">energy but the target the policy target</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.850" end="01:26:41.730" style="s2">I believe should be focused on the end</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.630" end="01:26:44.100" style="s2">goal which is getting carbon emissions</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.730" end="01:26:47.010" style="s2">out of energy so that&#39;s that net zero</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.100" end="01:26:49.260" style="s2">and emissions energy systems that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.010" end="01:26:51.480" style="s2">important and then you know if we set a</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.260" end="01:26:54.480" style="s2">target for a certain time you know so</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.480" end="01:26:57.360" style="s2">say we set a target for 80 to 100</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.480" end="01:26:59.790" style="s2">percent emissions reduction by 2050 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.360" end="01:27:01.980" style="s2">really important to make sure that that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.790" end="01:27:04.739" style="s2">can be reached and to make sure you have</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.980" end="01:27:06.780" style="s2">a plan for reaching that so the Obama</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.739" end="01:27:10.530" style="s2">administration published a mid-century</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.780" end="01:27:13.080" style="s2">strategy report shortly after the</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.530" end="01:27:14.760" style="s2">elections in 2016 this was something</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.080" end="01:27:17.790" style="s2">that they had been working on for a long</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.760" end="01:27:22.020" style="s2">time and this is the kind of analysis</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.790" end="01:27:26.190" style="s2">that should be behind policy targets for</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.020" end="01:27:27.989" style="s2">2050 for example for decarbonisation it</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.190" end="01:27:30.360" style="s2">is really important to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.989" end="01:27:35.070" style="s2">how we&#39;re gonna get to those targets and</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.360" end="01:27:37.050" style="s2">to put out those plans alongside the you</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.070" end="01:27:38.790" style="s2">know a statement of the end goal yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.050" end="01:27:40.679" style="s2">agree that it has to be realistic</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.790" end="01:27:41.969" style="s2">because again this Bernie thing I mean</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.679" end="01:27:44.840" style="s2">think about what he&#39;s saying a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.969" end="01:27:48.630" style="s2">percent renewable energy for all</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.840" end="01:27:52.710" style="s2">electricity and transportation no later</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.630" end="01:27:54.989" style="s2">than 2030 impossible and what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.710" end="01:27:56.940" style="s2">happen is you put that out there as his</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.989" end="01:27:59.280" style="s2">on his platform and it doesn&#39;t even come</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.940" end="01:28:00.150" style="s2">close I mean we&#39;d be lucky to get 20% by</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.280" end="01:28:01.739" style="s2">2030</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.150" end="01:28:03.870" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna cause people to believe that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.739" end="01:28:06.330" style="s2">these forecasts and goals are utterly</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.870" end="01:28:08.850" style="s2">unrealistic you know it seems to me the</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.330" end="01:28:11.880" style="s2">takeaway is that political statements</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.850" end="01:28:14.070" style="s2">about goals need to be based on science</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.880" end="01:28:18.090" style="s2">not just on God knows what that damn</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.070" end="01:28:21.510" style="s2">thing was was made up from what I want</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.090" end="01:28:24.590" style="s2">to see first is candidates supporting</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.510" end="01:28:27.270" style="s2">the idea and really engaged and</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.590" end="01:28:28.949" style="s2">understanding the importance of climate</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.270" end="01:28:31.290" style="s2">change mitigation so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.949" end="01:28:34.739" style="s2">thing I look for and actually I did</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.290" end="01:28:37.199" style="s2">write some live commentary during the</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.739" end="01:28:40.949" style="s2">candidates climate Town Hall that was</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.199" end="01:28:43.140" style="s2">hosted by CNN last fall so I got a close</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.949" end="01:28:45.480" style="s2">look at all of that time the list of</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.140" end="01:28:47.460" style="s2">candidates Democratic candidates their</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.480" end="01:28:51.690" style="s2">policies and I have to say that I was</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.460" end="01:28:53.460" style="s2">really heartened by the fact that first</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.690" end="01:28:55.890" style="s2">of all this event was being held at all</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.460" end="01:28:58.860" style="s2">if you had told me four years ago that</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.890" end="01:29:02.280" style="s2">CNN would be hosting a primary debate on</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.860" end="01:29:03.480" style="s2">climate change only I&#39;m not sure you</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.280" end="01:29:06.300" style="s2">know how likely I would have thought</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.480" end="01:29:09.090" style="s2">that that would be at that time so the</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.300" end="01:29:10.650" style="s2">fact that this was happening at all was</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.090" end="01:29:12.600" style="s2">really important and you could also see</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.650" end="01:29:14.610" style="s2">that many of the candidates have learned</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.600" end="01:29:18.480" style="s2">about this issue some more than others</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.610" end="01:29:19.980" style="s2">and you know have an understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.480" end="01:29:22.530" style="s2">the issue so that&#39;s one of the first</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.980" end="01:29:24.210" style="s2">things that I look for and a number of</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.530" end="01:29:26.310" style="s2">them I would say we&#39;re stronger than</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.210" end="01:29:28.469" style="s2">others in terms of their plans and how</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.310" end="01:29:31.949" style="s2">well thought through they were certainly</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.469" end="01:29:33.360" style="s2">having a plan a tall hat and actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.949" end="01:29:35.610" style="s2">wanting to do something about this</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.360" end="01:29:37.440" style="s2">problem is really critically important</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.610" end="01:29:39.960" style="s2">but then of course we want to back that</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.440" end="01:29:42.870" style="s2">up and make sure that those plans are</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.960" end="01:29:45.659" style="s2">informed by achievable targets and</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.870" end="01:29:48.600" style="s2">achievable actions that&#39;s of course what</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.659" end="01:29:51.179" style="s2">we want one last thing and then a half a</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.600" end="01:29:53.159" style="s2">thing global collective action problem</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.179" end="01:29:55.140" style="s2">you know the United States or Western</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.159" end="01:29:56.940" style="s2">Europe we could do our thing and we</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.140" end="01:29:59.159" style="s2">could get our carbon equivalent</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.940" end="01:30:00.600" style="s2">emissions to zero but if the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.159" end="01:30:02.370" style="s2">world doesn&#39;t follow it isn&#39;t gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.600" end="01:30:04.860" style="s2">any good what are some of your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.370" end="01:30:06.659" style="s2">on how we address the global collective</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.860" end="01:30:09.300" style="s2">action problem yeah so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.659" end="01:30:12.120" style="s2">questions that got me interested and</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.300" end="01:30:13.369" style="s2">starting down this path almost two</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.120" end="01:30:16.249" style="s2">decades ago of this</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.369" end="01:30:18.519" style="s2">search that I&#39;m doing was exactly this</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.249" end="01:30:20.139" style="s2">question of how do you bring about</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.519" end="01:30:22.610" style="s2">agreement among different</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.139" end="01:30:25.699" style="s2">decision-makers and specifically among</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.610" end="01:30:27.379" style="s2">countries and regions that are at</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.699" end="01:30:29.689" style="s2">different levels of Economic Development</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.379" end="01:30:31.929" style="s2">so you have some countries that have</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.689" end="01:30:35.090" style="s2">rapidly growing economies they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.929" end="01:30:37.610" style="s2">growing and income levels are rising</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.090" end="01:30:40.030" style="s2">more rapidly there&#39;s others where income</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.610" end="01:30:42.979" style="s2">levels are already high fairly high and</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.030" end="01:30:44.439" style="s2">you know growth has sort of leveled out</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.979" end="01:30:47.479" style="s2">some more so basically you have</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.439" end="01:30:50.649" style="s2">developed economies and then rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.479" end="01:30:54.110" style="s2">growing economies and these</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.649" end="01:30:55.760" style="s2">decision-makers have different problems</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.110" end="01:30:57.769" style="s2">that they&#39;re confronting and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.760" end="01:30:59.929" style="s2">question was always how to bring these</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.769" end="01:31:02.719" style="s2">decision-makers into agreement because</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.929" end="01:31:04.309" style="s2">rapidly developing economies it was</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.719" end="01:31:06.379" style="s2">thought would not want to sign on to</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.309" end="01:31:08.449" style="s2">climate policy because they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.379" end="01:31:10.909" style="s2">to have to pay for the carbon emissions</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.449" end="01:31:13.550" style="s2">that developed economies have already</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.909" end="01:31:15.709" style="s2">contributed you know the feeling was</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.550" end="01:31:17.329" style="s2">that developed economies have caused</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.709" end="01:31:19.010" style="s2">this problem and they should be the ones</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.329" end="01:31:21.379" style="s2">to pay for it now from the developed</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.010" end="01:31:23.869" style="s2">economies perspective they said we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.379" end="01:31:26.749" style="s2">want to do this alone you have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.869" end="01:31:30.709" style="s2">contribute your fair share to the</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.749" end="01:31:32.659" style="s2">rapidly developing economies and so this</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.709" end="01:31:34.849" style="s2">was a problem but one of the motivations</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.659" end="01:31:36.769" style="s2">for the research that I started to do</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.849" end="01:31:39.409" style="s2">was to ask okay well if we consider a</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.769" end="01:31:42.399" style="s2">technological innovation how does this</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.409" end="01:31:45.320" style="s2">picture change and I can say that I</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.399" end="01:31:47.629" style="s2">think you know there is there is actual</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.320" end="01:31:50.119" style="s2">actually reason for optimism that</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.629" end="01:31:52.429" style="s2">agreements could be reached because what</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.119" end="01:31:54.800" style="s2">you see when you look at what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.429" end="01:31:58.579" style="s2">over the last few decades is that in</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.800" end="01:32:00.439" style="s2">cases like in solar energy where we had</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.579" end="01:32:01.760" style="s2">policies around the world there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.439" end="01:32:03.679" style="s2">much coordination but there were</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.760" end="01:32:05.030" style="s2">different policies at different times in</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.679" end="01:32:07.659" style="s2">different countries you brought that</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.030" end="01:32:09.649" style="s2">brought about this very rapid and</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.659" end="01:32:11.329" style="s2">significant improvement to this</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.649" end="01:32:14.379" style="s2">technology that created a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.329" end="01:32:16.760" style="s2">opportunities in places where</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.379" end="01:32:19.159" style="s2">manufacturing innovation happened it</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.760" end="01:32:22.189" style="s2">created jobs in installation and</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.159" end="01:32:24.180" style="s2">manufacturing and then this technology</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.189" end="01:32:26.670" style="s2">was used everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.180" end="01:32:28.440" style="s2">the world and so I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.670" end="01:32:30.120" style="s2">something that could be repeated and</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.440" end="01:32:32.250" style="s2">other technology so I guess what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.120" end="01:32:35.730" style="s2">saying is that by adopting climate</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.250" end="01:32:37.410" style="s2">policy what happens is you can and</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.730" end="01:32:39.870" style="s2">especially if you do this in a way</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.410" end="01:32:42.180" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s you know carefully</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.870" end="01:32:44.040" style="s2">designed and strategic you can stimulate</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.180" end="01:32:48.120" style="s2">very significant technological</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.040" end="01:32:50.130" style="s2">innovation that benefits you and that</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.120" end="01:32:52.080" style="s2">leads to new technologies better</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.130" end="01:32:55.920" style="s2">technologies that can then be exported</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.080" end="01:32:59.430" style="s2">to other markets and so so it can really</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.920" end="01:33:02.370" style="s2">be seen as an opportunity and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.430" end="01:33:04.200" style="s2">message that was in a report that we</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.370" end="01:33:06.150" style="s2">wrote ahead of the Paris climate</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.200" end="01:33:09.780" style="s2">negotiations it&#39;s something that was</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.150" end="01:33:12.120" style="s2">referenced there and used at least in in</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.780" end="01:33:15.570" style="s2">some of the discussions based on on what</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.120" end="01:33:17.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard and this is so it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.570" end="01:33:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s pointing out that when you adopt</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.910" end="01:33:23.790" style="s2">climate policy and you enforce climate</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.840" end="01:33:25.740" style="s2">policy you don&#39;t just get the emissions</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.790" end="01:33:28.020" style="s2">reductions out you also get technology</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.740" end="01:33:31.350" style="s2">innovation out which creates lots of</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.020" end="01:33:33.870" style="s2">opportunities and so I see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.350" end="01:33:36.270" style="s2">there&#39;s actual potential once we</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.870" end="01:33:39.630" style="s2">recognize that innovation opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.270" end="01:33:41.310" style="s2">for greater agreement decision-makers</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.630" end="01:33:44.160" style="s2">around the world and actually that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.310" end="01:33:46.050" style="s2">people will not want to be left out you</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.160" end="01:33:49.620" style="s2">know so at some point we&#39;ll hit a</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.050" end="01:33:52.230" style="s2">tipping point where this decarbonisation</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.620" end="01:33:53.640" style="s2">trend will really take off I mean I hope</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.230" end="01:33:54.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if this is going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.640" end="01:33:58.230" style="s2">but this is something that could happen</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.960" end="01:34:00.540" style="s2">if we put the effort in and so this</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.230" end="01:34:02.480" style="s2">tipping point would then you know once</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.540" end="01:34:05.280" style="s2">we cross this or hit this tipping point</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.480" end="01:34:07.800" style="s2">it&#39;s in everybody&#39;s interest to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.280" end="01:34:10.980" style="s2">stay onboard and and just stay on top of</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.800" end="01:34:12.060" style="s2">this and not be left behind so I feel</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.980" end="01:34:13.980" style="s2">like that was a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.060" end="01:34:16.170" style="s2">confusing answer I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.980" end="01:34:19.830" style="s2">should start I think you hit on the key</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.170" end="01:34:22.620" style="s2">point let&#39;s let&#39;s exit on I hear people</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.830" end="01:34:24.600" style="s2">talk about despair about climate and</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.620" end="01:34:27.630" style="s2">that really makes me mad you know cuz it</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.600" end="01:34:30.240" style="s2">from what I see it&#39;s certainly a fixable</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.630" end="01:34:32.200" style="s2">problem you know it&#39;s probably on par</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.240" end="01:34:34.240" style="s2">with you know world</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.200" end="01:34:36.700" style="s2">- or something like that in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.240" end="01:34:38.560" style="s2">percentage of GDP and instead of being</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.700" end="01:34:41.110" style="s2">concentrated in two or three years at</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.560" end="01:34:43.750" style="s2">spread over 50 years so why why do</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.110" end="01:34:45.430" style="s2">people despair I shouldn&#39;t say why they</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.750" end="01:34:47.200" style="s2">spare I know why they despair because of</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.430" end="01:34:50.080" style="s2">bad memes floating around social media</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.200" end="01:34:52.690" style="s2">but do you think that there is more hope</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.080" end="01:34:54.460" style="s2">than despair appropriate and where you</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.690" end="01:34:56.290" style="s2">sit and knowing better than almost</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.460" end="01:34:58.030" style="s2">anybody on earth where these</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.290" end="01:35:00.970" style="s2">technologies really are and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.030" end="01:35:03.820" style="s2">possible yeah I think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.970" end="01:35:06.610" style="s2">reasons to be hopeful now I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.820" end="01:35:09.220" style="s2">say that it&#39;s a done deal and that we</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.610" end="01:35:12.460" style="s2">are you know definitely going to address</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.220" end="01:35:16.360" style="s2">this problem I don&#39;t know if we will but</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.460" end="01:35:18.760" style="s2">there&#39;s so much opportunity and you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.360" end="01:35:20.980" style="s2">I guess my approach and and sort of what</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.760" end="01:35:24.460" style="s2">I would encourage everybody to do is to</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.980" end="01:35:26.620" style="s2">try right if we&#39;re not trying if this is</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.460" end="01:35:28.920" style="s2">a problem that you care about and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.620" end="01:35:31.600" style="s2">not trying you&#39;re not doing what you can</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.920" end="01:35:34.240" style="s2">then the problem definitely won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.600" end="01:35:37.030" style="s2">addressed but if everyone tries everyone</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.240" end="01:35:39.820" style="s2">that cares about this problem tries then</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.030" end="01:35:42.370" style="s2">will I feel very confident that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.820" end="01:35:45.510" style="s2">get to where we need to be so I I remain</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.370" end="01:35:49.120" style="s2">hopeful but I don&#39;t spend my time</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.510" end="01:35:50.770" style="s2">thinking about whether or not we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.120" end="01:35:53.170" style="s2">address this problem of course that</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.770" end="01:35:55.810" style="s2">thought you know does come to me and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.170" end="01:35:58.600" style="s2">do I do have those thoughts but I</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.810" end="01:36:00.070" style="s2">quickly try to refocus my attention on</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.600" end="01:36:02.890" style="s2">doing what I can</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.070" end="01:36:05.530" style="s2">and trying my best the approach I take</p>
