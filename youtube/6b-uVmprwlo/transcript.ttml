<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">coming on the podcast yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.800" end="00:00:41.760" style="s2">wondering to start if you could just</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">give us a bit of an idea of your</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">background what got you interested in in</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">education in particular and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:53.510" style="s2">reforming education which is what a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">of your work seems to be on let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.510" end="00:01:05.390" style="s2">I&#39;m am dyslexic so I was always at odds</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">with school and with no assessment and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.390" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">testing in particular and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:12.740" style="s2">that meant from a young age I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">just take schools as given and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.740" end="00:01:16.410" style="s2">understood learning as something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:19.440" style="s2">kind of took place outside the schools</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.410" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">and so I taught myself music and it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.440" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">mostly interested in being musician</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:25.880" style="s2">until about halfway through college and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">it was actually at that point that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.880" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">became obsessed with certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">philosophy a kind of developmental kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">of evolutionary way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">the human experience I found it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">Emerson and Ken Wilber and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">livanski and Cobb Kaufman and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">bunch of other people I was reading then</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">charles sanders peirce and that allowed</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">me to see that there&#39;s a kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">cosmic function to education as an</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">aspect of human cultural evolution if</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">you understand cultural evolution itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">as continuous with biological and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:10.170" style="s2">cosmological evolution which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">that if you understand the human as</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.170" end="00:02:15.150" style="s2">nested in and evolving nature and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:15.860" style="s2">want to help the human continue to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.150" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">evolve</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.860" end="00:02:21.390" style="s2">you should probably focus on education</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">and this was what John Dewey you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.390" end="00:02:26.900" style="s2">John do we realize this early probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:29.579" style="s2">the most in the most profound way at</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.900" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">soonest after Darwin right because it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.579" end="00:02:34.769" style="s2">was Darwin they got the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:38.340" style="s2">system to start thinking about evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.769" end="00:02:41.550" style="s2">as opposed to a static or cyclical way</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.340" end="00:02:43.750" style="s2">of thinking about stuff so yes that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.550" end="00:02:46.240" style="s2">meant I plugged in education</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.750" end="00:02:48.490" style="s2">not with for an example the desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.240" end="00:02:50.350" style="s2">a teacher although I love teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.490" end="00:02:54.310" style="s2">have loved teachers I&#39;ve benefited</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.350" end="00:02:55.690" style="s2">massively from teaching and teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.310" end="00:02:59.260" style="s2">I also didn&#39;t go in thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.690" end="00:03:00.730" style="s2">schooling in particular or being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.260" end="00:03:02.470" style="s2">principal or thinking about school</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.730" end="00:03:05.410" style="s2">systems I came in very very much as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.470" end="00:03:07.870" style="s2">philosopher and doing basic work in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.410" end="00:03:10.930" style="s2">metaphysics and meta psychology and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.870" end="00:03:12.760" style="s2">work in psychology was developmental</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.930" end="00:03:14.590" style="s2">psychology specifically in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.760" end="00:03:17.830" style="s2">psychometrics and so the first book was</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.590" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2">about how we measure Minds and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.830" end="00:03:22.060" style="s2">social justice issues related with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.750" end="00:03:23.950" style="s2">standardized testing infrastructures and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.060" end="00:03:25.470" style="s2">I run the history of that from the IQ</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.950" end="00:03:27.940" style="s2">tests up through No Child Left Behind</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.470" end="00:03:29.740" style="s2">and then the second book education and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.940" end="00:03:32.440" style="s2">time between worlds continues just with</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.740" end="00:03:35.590" style="s2">that kind of meta systemic reflection on</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.440" end="00:03:40.240" style="s2">education as an issue transcending and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.590" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">including schooling as an issue and when</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.240" end="00:03:44.380" style="s2">you start to look at it that way you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">start to realize that actually education</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.380" end="00:03:49.000" style="s2">itself is tied up in issues of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:50.920" style="s2">civilizational continuity which is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.000" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">say one way to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:57.730" style="s2">civilization is is the continuous</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">intergenerational transmission of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.730" end="00:04:04.660" style="s2">particular kind of skill capacity virtue</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:07.090" style="s2">and when there are rifts in the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.660" end="00:04:09.610" style="s2">of intergenerational transmission such</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.090" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">that the civilization cannot reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.610" end="00:04:14.700" style="s2">itself however Moss thought of this as</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">sociological autobuses</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.700" end="00:04:19.410" style="s2">when the society cannot reproduce itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:21.100" style="s2">through the basic function of Education</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.410" end="00:04:23.970" style="s2">then you have something like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.100" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">civilizational collapse dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">these dynamics have been tracked by a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:31.570" style="s2">bunch of researchers including people</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">like Tainter and Danish Whataburger was</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.570" end="00:04:36.280" style="s2">a colleague of mine so the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:38.650" style="s2">education in civilizational collapse</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.280" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">started to fall into place for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">towards the end of graduate school so</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:45.930" style="s2">that&#39;s mostly where I&#39;m working now is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:50.470" style="s2">thinking about this interface of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.930" end="00:04:52.419" style="s2">metaphysics psychology and politics in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.470" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">this realm of Education and I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.419" end="00:04:57.790" style="s2">loans</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.760" end="00:05:01.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s the versus some of it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.790" end="00:05:04.330" style="s2">brings us to speed yeah I mean based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.930" end="00:05:06.460" style="s2">on some of what you&#39;ve just said and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.330" end="00:05:09.960" style="s2">indeed the title of the recent book</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.460" end="00:05:12.520" style="s2">education in a time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.960" end="00:05:16.170" style="s2">there&#39;s this sense that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:19.420" style="s2">something is is breaking down something</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.170" end="00:05:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s changing that&#39;s what I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.420" end="00:05:22.030" style="s2">bunch of those guys</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.440" end="00:05:25.930" style="s2">Daniel schmuck Dan burger talks about</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.030" end="00:05:29.380" style="s2">that a bunch what do you think it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.930" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">that is perhaps crumbling falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.380" end="00:05:39.070" style="s2">and how is that tied with education I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:43.240" style="s2">mean in a very general sense I talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.070" end="00:05:45.940" style="s2">about it in the book as the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.240" end="00:05:50.280" style="s2">world system and this is a term used by</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.940" end="00:05:53.290" style="s2">Immanuel Wallerstein it was incredible</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.280" end="00:05:56.890" style="s2">historian of economics and politics and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.290" end="00:05:58.950" style="s2">culture and you know when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.890" end="00:06:00.670" style="s2">what&#39;s distinctive about the West and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.950" end="00:06:05.950" style="s2">specifically what&#39;s distinctive about</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.670" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">what happened after about 1600 when</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.950" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">there was a major shift in the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">of industrialization and capitalization</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:19.990" style="s2">which created what Wallerstein describes</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:21.490" style="s2">as the capitalist world system and now</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.990" end="00:06:24.540" style="s2">there have been other world systems that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.490" end="00:06:26.940" style="s2">have not been capitalists and in fact as</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.540" end="00:06:30.130" style="s2">wallerstein shows if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.940" end="00:06:31.960" style="s2">mesopotamia and what we now call the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.130" end="00:06:35.020" style="s2">Middle East and the Indus River Valley</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.960" end="00:06:38.520" style="s2">you see prior to the emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.020" end="00:06:41.640" style="s2">capitalist world system a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.520" end="00:06:43.690" style="s2">coexisting non capitalist world systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.640" end="00:06:45.690" style="s2">and so what that means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.690" end="00:06:48.220" style="s2">capitalist world system did something</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.690" end="00:06:52.360" style="s2">interesting and actually succeeded in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.220" end="00:06:55.690" style="s2">making a global world system as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.360" end="00:06:58.750" style="s2">to a self-contained world system on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.690" end="00:07:01.240" style="s2">same globe with other world systems you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.750" end="00:07:03.640" style="s2">see and so thinking about it in those</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.240" end="00:07:05.020" style="s2">terms actually this is maybe a footnote</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.640" end="00:07:06.120" style="s2">but thinking about in these in these</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:08.310" style="s2">other terms</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.120" end="00:07:09.690" style="s2">helps you think back into cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.310" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">history what it would have been like to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.690" end="00:07:13.580" style="s2">live prior to the emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:16.380" style="s2">capitalist world system where</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.580" end="00:07:19.320" style="s2">intercultural exchange was more like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.380" end="00:07:20.940" style="s2">movement between world systems then like</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.320" end="00:07:22.500" style="s2">a movement between cultures within a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.940" end="00:07:24.060" style="s2">single world system which is what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.500" end="00:07:24.840" style="s2">have now and that&#39;s what people talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.060" end="00:07:27.660" style="s2">about when they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.840" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">multiculturalism and the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.660" end="00:07:35.030" style="s2">that is that it&#39;s like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:36.840" style="s2">system&#39;s contained by capitalism by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.030" end="00:07:39.620" style="s2">infrastructures and dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.840" end="00:07:42.620" style="s2">capitalism and we can get into that but</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.620" end="00:07:45.480" style="s2">which means that culture is now</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.620" end="00:07:46.980" style="s2">different than it used to be and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.480" end="00:07:49.950" style="s2">however most talks about this as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.980" end="00:07:52.370" style="s2">colonialization of the life world which</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.950" end="00:07:54.330" style="s2">didn&#39;t used to be potentially complete</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.370" end="00:07:59.250" style="s2">before the capitalist world system</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.330" end="00:08:00.540" style="s2">achieved its global enclosure and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.250" end="00:08:05.240" style="s2">what that meant means is that for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.540" end="00:08:09.200" style="s2">first time ever a civilization has</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.240" end="00:08:11.010" style="s2">enclosed the entire planet and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.200" end="00:08:13.050" style="s2">unfortunately that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.010" end="00:08:16.979" style="s2">about when I&#39;m talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.050" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">coming apart and so it used to be when</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.979" end="00:08:23.460" style="s2">world systems came untangled there were</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:26.430" style="s2">other world systems thousands of miles</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.460" end="00:08:28.260" style="s2">away that weren&#39;t affected and there</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.430" end="00:08:30.600" style="s2">were ecosystems that had never been</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.260" end="00:08:33.349" style="s2">touched by humans were brought into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.600" end="00:08:36.150" style="s2">dynamics of any world system capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.349" end="00:08:41.510" style="s2">world systems are also world Ecology&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.150" end="00:08:41.510" style="s2">world systems also organize ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.020" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">live within them and so yeah this this</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.050" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">particular one that we&#39;re looking at now</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:51.990" style="s2">and capitalism may not be the right word</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:55.640" style="s2">anymore to be honest with you but it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.990" end="00:09:01.220" style="s2">a it is a totalized infrastructural</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.640" end="00:09:03.450" style="s2">project and it&#39;s a fragmented planetary</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.220" end="00:09:05.730" style="s2">computational stack as has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.450" end="00:09:07.830" style="s2">described by Benjamin Benjamin Bratton</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.730" end="00:09:08.580" style="s2">at the most abstract level and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.580" end="00:09:15.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a planetary system yes but it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.130" end="00:09:19.629" style="s2">not Planetary by transcendental design</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.630" end="00:09:23.269" style="s2">was Planetary by ambition and</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:36.259" style="s2">the perspective of measurement and the</p>

<p begin="00:09:41.350" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">but also you&#39;re living right with it</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.389" end="00:09:50.329" style="s2">when you&#39;re taking a standardized test</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">or in any kind of building that is up to</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">you are in a architectural space that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.680" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">has been standardized by the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:10:02.389" style="s2">world system for you as opposed to an</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.389" end="00:10:07.939" style="s2">cultural transmission alone for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.350" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">so there&#39;s a shift in the relation</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.939" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">between culture and system and is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:13.850" style="s2">shift in the relation between system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:19.129" style="s2">system so that we have one giant system</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.850" end="00:10:21.829" style="s2">where it&#39;s all interconnected and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.129" end="00:10:23.509" style="s2">don&#39;t have what I call a planetary idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.829" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">app ad is a Greek word that means</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.509" end="00:10:26.930" style="s2">education so although we have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:29.689" style="s2">interconnected infrastructure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.930" end="00:10:31.250" style="s2">global and that&#39;s complex statement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.689" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">we can get into that of course it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.250" end="00:10:38.449" style="s2">entirely global Russia China right</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:41.060" style="s2">places that are not but from one another</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.449" end="00:10:43.699" style="s2">perspective there&#39;s nothing outside of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.060" end="00:10:45.920" style="s2">the containment of these largest</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.699" end="00:10:49.310" style="s2">infrastructures there&#39;s not a major</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.920" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">systemic cascade that wouldn&#39;t ricochet</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.310" end="00:10:56.569" style="s2">around the entire planet which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:58.730" style="s2">unprecedented amazing gift of planet</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.569" end="00:11:00.829" style="s2">ization the kind of urgency of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.730" end="00:11:04.790" style="s2">interconnectedness of it all but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.829" end="00:11:06.860" style="s2">the danger of having the world system</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.790" end="00:11:10.430" style="s2">incapsulate the planet is that if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.860" end="00:11:13.699" style="s2">world system fails it&#39;s game over in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.430" end="00:11:15.889" style="s2">way that didn&#39;t used to be true and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.699" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">yeah the measurement infrastructures are</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.889" end="00:11:21.589" style="s2">some of those things that already</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:24.980" style="s2">encircle the planet and our educational</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.589" end="00:11:27.340" style="s2">infrastructures are fragmented and from</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.980" end="00:11:30.190" style="s2">like the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.340" end="00:11:32.980" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the dynamic I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.190" end="00:11:34.930" style="s2">is the lag between technological</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.980" end="00:11:38.110" style="s2">economic interconnection at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.930" end="00:11:41.050" style="s2">planetary level and fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.110" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">nationalistic human capital oriented</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.050" end="00:11:47.020" style="s2">educational systems which have not kept</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:48.250" style="s2">pace with the technological change and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.020" end="00:11:51.090" style="s2">to the extent we&#39;re now at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.250" end="00:11:53.710" style="s2">technology field chains acting back on</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.090" end="00:11:55.420" style="s2">the generational transmission because</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.710" end="00:11:58.120" style="s2">I&#39;m getting answer like the technology</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.420" end="00:11:59.110" style="s2">companies are disrupting the potentials</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.120" end="00:12:02.490" style="s2">of intergenerational transmission</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.110" end="00:12:07.210" style="s2">through predatory and addictive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.490" end="00:12:09.070" style="s2">screen-based cultures so I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.210" end="00:12:14.010" style="s2">rambling that but that it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.070" end="00:12:17.380" style="s2">coming card is big and complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.010" end="00:12:20.680" style="s2">truly complex in like the technical</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.380" end="00:12:22.530" style="s2">sense of that term which means that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.680" end="00:12:25.270" style="s2">is going through some catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.530" end="00:12:27.100" style="s2">bifurcation so that&#39;s what I also kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.270" end="00:12:30.010" style="s2">of mean and this is Wallerstein&#39;s terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.100" end="00:12:33.640" style="s2">he pulls from pretty gene and looks at</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.010" end="00:12:35.410" style="s2">these kind of very complex systems far</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.640" end="00:12:37.690" style="s2">from equilibrium and what they do and he</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.410" end="00:12:39.250" style="s2">says this is what this is what world</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.690" end="00:12:40.990" style="s2">systems look like they&#39;re massively</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.250" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">complex systems that go through</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.990" end="00:12:49.710" style="s2">catastrophic bifurcations or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.290" end="00:12:54.270" style="s2">which means now is a time of incredible</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.710" end="00:12:57.910" style="s2">opportunity as well as incredible danger</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.270" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">so I see mostly it as an educational</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.910" end="00:13:02.770" style="s2">crisis it&#39;s a time that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:05.700" style="s2">understand again what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.770" end="00:13:09.970" style="s2">human and understand again how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.700" end="00:13:13.870" style="s2">instill in the next generations the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.970" end="00:13:17.350" style="s2">things that will constitute the future</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.870" end="00:13:21.660" style="s2">that&#39;s worth living and one very</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.350" end="00:13:24.090" style="s2">different from what&#39;s currently our path</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.660" end="00:13:28.510" style="s2">we just got we into the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.090" end="00:13:32.080" style="s2">basically I think it&#39;s only it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.510" end="00:13:33.910" style="s2">sort of frames a lot of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.080" end="00:13:36.820" style="s2">that we face really well to think of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.910" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">sort of capitalism or maybe even you</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.820" end="00:13:41.160" style="s2">could even call it modernity as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:42.899" style="s2">world-system it sort of makes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.160" end="00:13:45.320" style="s2">sense that we would be facing a climate</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.899" end="00:13:49.740" style="s2">crisis that affects the whole planet and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.320" end="00:13:51.779" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a very good point you</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.740" end="00:13:55.160" style="s2">made about education I&#39;ve heard it said</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.779" end="00:13:56.730" style="s2">that we basically still have</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.160" end="00:14:01.380" style="s2">factory-style</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.730" end="00:14:06.149" style="s2">education we produce children in batches</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.380" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">based on age and the day&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.149" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">the the school if you look at say louie</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:14.579" style="s2">alpha sir he very specifically draws a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:19.350" style="s2">parallel between sort of level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.579" end="00:14:20.820" style="s2">schooling and class that basically the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.350" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">one thing you can obviously be said is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.820" end="00:14:27.510" style="s2">that in sort of Britain nowadays a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:31.500" style="s2">university degree is essentially just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.510" end="00:14:33.089" style="s2">ticket into the middle class and though</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.500" end="00:14:36.089" style="s2">I think I think I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.089" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">very good point about how how we live in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.089" end="00:14:41.610" style="s2">a world that&#39;s moving in leaps and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:44.519" style="s2">bounds and the is now totally</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.610" end="00:14:48.329" style="s2">interconnected education seems to still</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.519" end="00:14:54.540" style="s2">completely resemble what it did in 1850</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.329" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">in many ways yeah I mean in in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.540" end="00:15:00.810" style="s2">places that&#39;s totally true so the way I</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:02.490" style="s2">would frame it is this there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.810" end="00:15:05.550" style="s2">correspondence principle that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.490" end="00:15:07.079" style="s2">talked about in the history of education</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.550" end="00:15:10.410" style="s2">where there&#39;s a correspondence between</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.079" end="00:15:13.800" style="s2">the mode of production in the economy</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.410" end="00:15:15.630" style="s2">and means of relationship and dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.800" end="00:15:18.420" style="s2">relationship in schools and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.630" end="00:15:21.480" style="s2">that notion of the factory school occurs</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.410" end="00:15:53.300" style="s2">seeing another shift in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.830" end="00:15:56.060" style="s2">has to do with move towards taking apart</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.300" end="00:15:58.340" style="s2">the big factory schools and replacing</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.060" end="00:16:00.230" style="s2">them with things that look like startup</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.340" end="00:16:02.330" style="s2">companies this is the charter school</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.860" end="00:16:27.170" style="s2">now the kind of white-collar and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.970" end="00:16:29.410" style="s2">gig economy is being mirrored in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.170" end="00:16:33.190" style="s2">of much more fractured and</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.530" end="00:16:40.430" style="s2">that&#39;s very different from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.420" end="00:16:42.260" style="s2">doing an ideal of getting all the kids</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.430" end="00:16:44.810" style="s2">in a melting pot you&#39;re actually</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.790" end="00:16:58.850" style="s2">the difference there so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.080" end="00:17:01.670" style="s2">difference you know between it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.850" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">just factory schools in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.670" end="00:17:05.420" style="s2">transcend a factory schools with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:09.410" style="s2">movement into white-collar labor some</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.420" end="00:17:11.740" style="s2">time ago and we&#39;re moving into something</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.410" end="00:17:14.449" style="s2">now that looks like this educational</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.740" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">marketplace like a educational gig</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.449" end="00:17:22.630" style="s2">economy and yeah the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:25.339" style="s2">marketization of the educational system</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.630" end="00:17:28.339" style="s2">itself as a dynamic that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.339" end="00:17:29.750" style="s2">see as part of this expansion of the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.339" end="00:17:33.380" style="s2">capitalist world system part of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.750" end="00:17:35.210" style="s2">endgame is that we start to turn into</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.380" end="00:17:41.290" style="s2">markets things that were never</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.210" end="00:17:43.430" style="s2">considered as to be markets and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.290" end="00:17:45.260" style="s2">educational capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.430" end="00:17:47.060" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s a symptom of late</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.260" end="00:17:50.450" style="s2">capitalism that we need to find more and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.060" end="00:17:54.740" style="s2">more realms to commodify to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.450" end="00:17:57.890" style="s2">grow the economy so I&#39;m yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.740" end="00:18:00.890" style="s2">was just saying about how how we</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.890" end="00:18:02.780" style="s2">actually did an episode with I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.890" end="00:18:05.240" style="s2">you remember and with</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.780" end="00:18:06.970" style="s2">guy who asked to remain anonymous um</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.240" end="00:18:09.620" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.970" end="00:18:11.290" style="s2">Irish University professor Eck&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.620" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">University professor and he was</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.290" end="00:18:16.210" style="s2">basically saying about how universities</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">as educational institutions have</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.210" end="00:18:21.980" style="s2">fundamentally changed in Britain oh well</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:24.560" style="s2">in Ireland and you see exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.980" end="00:18:27.290" style="s2">thing in Britain which is that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.560" end="00:18:30.410" style="s2">basically are now geared towards getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.290" end="00:18:32.660" style="s2">students into the university because</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.410" end="00:18:36.580" style="s2">number of students determines funding</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:39.130" style="s2">which in turn determines profits and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.580" end="00:18:42.860" style="s2">this has been completely at the expense</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.130" end="00:18:44.900" style="s2">research and that the university</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.860" end="00:18:48.380" style="s2">management are now very uninterested in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.900" end="00:18:50.470" style="s2">research going on in universities think</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.380" end="00:18:53.920" style="s2">about it that could be an entire</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.340" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">thought and and and research right you</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.830" end="00:19:23.980" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting dynamic i</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">I write about it under the rubric of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:33.230" style="s2">which is the idea that you can apply</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.290" end="00:20:02.300" style="s2">also see that it&#39;s not simply that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.190" end="00:20:05.030" style="s2">transactional relationship takes place</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.300" end="00:20:06.800" style="s2">between the student and the college</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.239" end="00:20:16.950" style="s2">but there&#39;s also this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.220" end="00:20:20.119" style="s2">between the colleges and financial</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.950" end="00:20:23.249" style="s2">services agencies which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.119" end="00:20:26.899" style="s2">where the colleges put the kids in debt</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.249" end="00:20:29.759" style="s2">the colleges are themselves in debt and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.899" end="00:20:32.730" style="s2">you end up creating an idea a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.759" end="00:20:35.659" style="s2">which is like a bubble but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.730" end="00:20:37.889" style="s2">student loan bubble so it&#39;s the works</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.659" end="00:20:41.519" style="s2">like this and it doesn&#39;t have worked in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.889" end="00:20:44.730" style="s2">real estate where the people who build</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.519" end="00:20:47.009" style="s2">the houses get the money from the banks</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.730" end="00:20:50.820" style="s2">to build houses and build them on debt</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.009" end="00:20:52.590" style="s2">and then the people who buy the houses</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.820" end="00:20:55.379" style="s2">of course take mortgages so the houses</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.590" end="00:20:58.169" style="s2">are bought on that were also built on</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.379" end="00:21:01.609" style="s2">debt the same banks give out that debt</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.169" end="00:21:04.590" style="s2">so the contractors pay back their debts</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.609" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">with the money that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.590" end="00:21:12.119" style="s2">bought the houses took from the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:15.359" style="s2">bank so you can see how and this is a of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.119" end="00:21:17.879" style="s2">course a mature economic analysis but</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.359" end="00:21:19.710" style="s2">you can see how this works right where</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.879" end="00:21:21.809" style="s2">the colleges are now in order to pay</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.710" end="00:21:24.269" style="s2">back their debts needing to fill more</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.809" end="00:21:26.460" style="s2">seats they just build a new building</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.269" end="00:21:28.350" style="s2">they need to fill more seats in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.460" end="00:21:30.600" style="s2">pay back those debts putting the kids in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.350" end="00:21:34.409" style="s2">debt in order to pay back the college&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.600" end="00:21:36.359" style="s2">debt and so great were talks but great</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.409" end="00:21:38.190" style="s2">for dogs been made yeah greater talks</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.359" end="00:21:41.429" style="s2">about the dynamic Anna and a few other</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.190" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">people and stricking because it means</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.429" end="00:21:44.119" style="s2">that at the end of the day who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.919" style="s2">shouldering the ultimate debt is the</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.919" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna be able to pay it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.019" end="00:21:56.519" style="s2">very high similar to the mortgage holder</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:22:00.119" style="s2">in the financial bubble holding</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.519" end="00:22:01.889" style="s2">ultimately the end of the debt rope and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.119" end="00:22:04.169" style="s2">their house not being what it actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.889" end="00:22:05.850" style="s2">said it was worth right and that&#39;s how a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.169" end="00:22:07.259" style="s2">bubble bursts when at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.850" end="00:22:10.440" style="s2">we need to cash in there&#39;s value</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.259" end="00:22:12.629" style="s2">somewhere and it&#39;s supposed to be now in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.440" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">the skills of the kids who went through</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.629" end="00:22:17.669" style="s2">their colleges but the economy is not</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.669" end="00:22:21.779" style="s2">cash those skills and you repay the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.230" end="00:22:23.490" style="s2">debts so the student at least in the</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.030" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">start to think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.770" end="00:23:07.310" style="s2">remediating the actual concrete economic</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.080" end="00:23:20.540" style="s2">loan debt the reaction is well that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:42.200" style="s2">things we know it was fine to turn</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.580" end="00:23:44.990" style="s2">education into a purely transactional</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.730" end="00:23:57.710" style="s2">to the same extent but because of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.100" end="00:24:13.940" style="s2">research goes on is is an important</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.470" end="00:24:16.370" style="s2">question and that gets to the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.940" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">civilizational collapse as a function of</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.060" end="00:24:58.940" style="s2">spiral of kind of like the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.640" end="00:25:00.890" style="s2">side of these collapse dynamics and</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.890" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">serious you&#39;ve talked about taking the</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:12.950" style="s2">and this is what I find quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.930" end="00:25:14.870" style="s2">interesting I know you have heard you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.950" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">talk elsewhere I think with Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.870" end="00:25:20.900" style="s2">Thorson about the ways almost like it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.590" end="00:25:24.260" style="s2">used a word meta psychology the theory</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.900" end="00:25:25.820" style="s2">we we have about ourselves and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.260" end="00:25:29.300" style="s2">the way we interact with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.820" end="00:25:33.530" style="s2">with society plays itself out in how we</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.300" end="00:25:35.480" style="s2">do think like education I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.530" end="00:25:39.260" style="s2">if you could perhaps explain what might</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.480" end="00:25:41.240" style="s2">be the theory of self that exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.260" end="00:25:43.640" style="s2">kind of current paradigm as it exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.240" end="00:25:47.180" style="s2">and what might be a better theory of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.640" end="00:25:52.910" style="s2">self and indeed of society going</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.180" end="00:25:56.390" style="s2">forwards that&#39;s really interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.910" end="00:26:00.020" style="s2">know at least there&#39;s two ways to think</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.390" end="00:26:03.260" style="s2">about this you know one is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.020" end="00:26:05.450" style="s2">a there&#39;s a way that were there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.260" end="00:26:08.060" style="s2">that we&#39;re like structurally</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.450" end="00:26:10.490" style="s2">incentivized to understand ourselves by</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.060" end="00:26:12.470" style="s2">virtue of the bureaucracies and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.490" end="00:26:17.090" style="s2">institutions and family systems we find</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.470" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">ourselves in and so that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.090" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">kind of dimension of this issue which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:26.780" style="s2">that when you talk about like a false</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:30.130" style="s2">self and a real self right or kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.780" end="00:26:33.380" style="s2">authentic self in an authentic self or</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.130" end="00:26:37.610" style="s2">persona versus like you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.380" end="00:26:42.410" style="s2">individuated like Union self that sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.610" end="00:26:45.020" style="s2">of duplicity in identity and that who I</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.410" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">show myself to be in society is not who</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.020" end="00:26:50.390" style="s2">I feel myself to be in private right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:52.590" style="s2">those kinds of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.390" end="00:26:54.870" style="s2">need to be surfaced before you start</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.590" end="00:26:57.030" style="s2">talking about like what which self</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.870" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">are we moving into itself are we coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.030" end="00:27:04.130" style="s2">from so you need to locate first the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:06.300" style="s2">question in your own experience yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.130" end="00:27:08.040" style="s2">because I think that would be one way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.300" end="00:27:09.860" style="s2">think about the self or leaving as</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.040" end="00:27:14.810" style="s2">itself that&#39;s just a thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.860" end="00:27:17.700" style="s2">right that&#39;s what the ego is a thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.810" end="00:27:20.190" style="s2">which is to say it&#39;s important one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.700" end="00:27:22.560" style="s2">like the linchpin thought it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.190" end="00:27:25.470" style="s2">center of your self-esteem and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.560" end="00:27:27.180" style="s2">center of your motivation and the center</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.470" end="00:27:29.930" style="s2">of what holds your identity to Gander</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.180" end="00:27:32.310" style="s2">with you know together with boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.930" end="00:27:33.930" style="s2">but at the end of the day it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.310" end="00:27:35.730" style="s2">abstraction and that&#39;s what many</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.930" end="00:27:38.250" style="s2">contemplative traditions are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.730" end="00:27:39.900" style="s2">expose something that&#39;s not real that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.250" end="00:27:42.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a function not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.900" end="00:27:48.120" style="s2">not important to be actually a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.840" end="00:27:50.580" style="s2">dynamic and mature and complex ego but</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.120" end="00:27:53.070" style="s2">there&#39;s still a way in which there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.580" end="00:27:57.450" style="s2">other ways of relating to this question</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.070" end="00:27:59.610" style="s2">of self non-descriptive not parsed in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:02.910" style="s2">semantically and propositional e</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.610" end="00:28:05.280" style="s2">differentiated speech but as lived</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.910" end="00:28:06.990" style="s2">experience and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.280" end="00:28:10.140" style="s2">phenomenological traditions and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.990" end="00:28:12.660" style="s2">begins contemplator traditions and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.140" end="00:28:14.310" style="s2">think because of the nature of half</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.660" end="00:28:16.770" style="s2">civilization is changing the educational</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.310" end="00:28:20.250" style="s2">crisis I raise this question what is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.770" end="00:28:23.550" style="s2">human and so I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.250" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">looking at like some new theory of self</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.550" end="00:28:31.650" style="s2">that&#39;s articulated in language although</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:33.210" style="s2">I think we&#39;re gonna get that I think at</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.650" end="00:28:36.290" style="s2">the end of the day we&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.210" end="00:28:41.940" style="s2">new new certain new possibilities for</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.290" end="00:28:47.100" style="s2">embodied experience of self and which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.940" end="00:28:49.860" style="s2">kind of like a move out of the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.100" end="00:28:52.890" style="s2">linguistically mediated forms of self</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.860" end="00:28:54.840" style="s2">understanding and to move into those</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.890" end="00:29:00.680" style="s2">forms of understanding that are mediated</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.840" end="00:29:00.680" style="s2">by relationship empathy movement</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.909" end="00:29:09.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a dissolve quite abstract and but</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.359" end="00:29:11.799" style="s2">it&#39;s you know the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.210" end="00:29:15.629" style="s2">knowing someone by virtue of their</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.799" end="00:29:18.759" style="s2">resume and knowing someone by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.629" end="00:29:23.229" style="s2">sharing a meal with them right</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.759" end="00:29:27.099" style="s2">so like the abstract ego of modernity is</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.229" end="00:29:30.039" style="s2">like a resume right like it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.099" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">about that front facing persona and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.039" end="00:29:34.210" style="s2">it looks like that&#39;s the commodity</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:36.549" style="s2">fetishism of the identity that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.210" end="00:29:38.229" style="s2">characterizes the self of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.549" end="00:29:40.629" style="s2">which is that you apply the commodity</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.229" end="00:29:44.229" style="s2">form to the self which is then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.629" end="00:29:45.909" style="s2">pretended you got a shelf and you hide</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.229" end="00:29:48.129" style="s2">the whole production process behind it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.909" end="00:29:54.149" style="s2">and you clarify its relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.129" end="00:29:57.749" style="s2">price so you know wage labor</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.149" end="00:30:01.029" style="s2">characterizes the self of modernity and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.749" end="00:30:05.049" style="s2">the selling of myself into the wage</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.029" end="00:30:07.029" style="s2">labor market forces in a sense the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.049" end="00:30:08.379" style="s2">application of commodity form to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.029" end="00:30:12.039" style="s2">self and therefore the truncation</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.379" end="00:30:13.629" style="s2">alienation so so for example this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.039" end="00:30:15.700" style="s2">what I&#39;m getting at if we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.629" end="00:30:17.710" style="s2">the category of wage labor anymore</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.700" end="00:30:20.830" style="s2">because there was something like a basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.710" end="00:30:23.950" style="s2">income guarantee then that would disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.830" end="00:30:26.979" style="s2">not the thought of self but the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.950" end="00:30:29.229" style="s2">experience of self like intergeneration</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.979" end="00:30:32.950" style="s2">there would be something so different to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.229" end="00:30:35.470" style="s2">being brought into an ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.950" end="00:30:37.059" style="s2">social life where there was no category</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.470" end="00:30:39.389" style="s2">of wage labor where the self didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.059" end="00:30:44.039" style="s2">necessarily have to be commodified and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.389" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">presented into the markets as a resume</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.039" end="00:30:49.629" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an example where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:50.979" style="s2">so much gonna it&#39;s probably more that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.629" end="00:30:52.450" style="s2">we&#39;ll figure out which of the theories</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.979" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">of self we&#39;ve already had in which of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.450" end="00:30:58.029" style="s2">the ways of talking about self actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.070" end="00:31:00.669" style="s2">makes sense not that we&#39;re gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.029" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">new novel way of explaining myself in</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.669" end="00:31:04.479" style="s2">fact we&#39;re gonna kind of come to realize</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:06.099" style="s2">what I call like the return to the human</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.479" end="00:31:08.440" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna come to realize what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.099" end="00:31:10.599" style="s2">kind of always been what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.440" end="00:31:13.539" style="s2">tricked out of realizing we are again</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.599" end="00:31:14.050" style="s2">just like thinking that self organizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.539" end="00:31:16.660" style="s2">enable</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.050" end="00:31:20.590" style="s2">educational initiative all volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.660" end="00:31:23.380" style="s2">based right doesn&#39;t quote count but for</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.590" end="00:31:26.400" style="s2">me an LLC that makes a profit the gen</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.380" end="00:31:29.620" style="s2">moves up the GDP that quote does count</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.400" end="00:31:32.070" style="s2">right so it&#39;s kind of like where are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.620" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">places where you can do self creation</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.070" end="00:31:38.890" style="s2">outside of transactional market dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">as more of those become available for</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.890" end="00:31:42.970" style="s2">better and for worse because the economy</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">right which is a safe economy breaks we</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.970" end="00:31:48.010" style="s2">also get that opportunity because then</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:49.930" style="s2">money is not worth anything and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.010" end="00:31:51.100" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck realizing other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.930" end="00:31:54.570" style="s2">thinking about the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.100" end="00:31:58.120" style="s2">people and who we are what we&#39;re worth</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.570" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">what we can do right so if there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.120" end="00:32:07.660" style="s2">to be a D abstraction of the self return</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">to kind of a basic embodied sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.660" end="00:32:15.370" style="s2">human and yeah that&#39;s I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:19.000" style="s2">things that characterizes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.370" end="00:32:22.540" style="s2">crisis and transformation of personality</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.000" end="00:32:25.750" style="s2">and relationship is moments when the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.540" end="00:32:28.090" style="s2">language game breaks down and when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.750" end="00:32:31.300" style="s2">fall into a deeper layer of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.090" end="00:32:37.930" style="s2">and process and it feels like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.300" end="00:32:41.080" style="s2">actually in reality not in some model or</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.930" end="00:32:42.970" style="s2">language you had about it and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.080" end="00:32:44.890" style="s2">going through that like as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.970" end="00:32:47.260" style="s2">where the language isn&#39;t working and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.890" end="00:32:49.570" style="s2">certain realities are beginning to well</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.260" end="00:32:53.020" style="s2">bump up against the you things we use to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.570" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">control them like the weather and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.020" end="00:32:58.060" style="s2">human nervous system and our inner</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:33:01.420" style="s2">nature&#39;s are exhausting our control</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.060" end="00:33:04.060" style="s2">mechanisms and our explanatory capacity</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.420" end="00:33:07.620" style="s2">which means we&#39;re going to be forced</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.060" end="00:33:11.200" style="s2">back to the kind of raw experience of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.620" end="00:33:13.150" style="s2">being human hopefully we will as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.200" end="00:33:24.520" style="s2">done in the past reconstruct some sanity</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.150" end="00:33:25.960" style="s2">out of that to sort of a realization</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.520" end="00:33:27.820" style="s2">that we&#39;ve sort of been tricked into</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.960" end="00:33:29.680" style="s2">thinking that we haven&#39;t had is is very</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.820" end="00:33:32.230" style="s2">because I can certainly think especially</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.680" end="00:33:35.800" style="s2">with this sort of with the analogy of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.230" end="00:33:37.570" style="s2">not-for-profit organisations that most</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.800" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">of I certainly would consider the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.570" end="00:33:42.010" style="s2">volunteering which is not a lot by any</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:43.900" style="s2">means especially in terms of the amount</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.010" end="00:33:46.450" style="s2">of time I&#39;ve spent volunteering prepared</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.900" end="00:33:48.550" style="s2">comments been working I would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.450" end="00:33:51.940" style="s2">think that the volunteering that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.550" end="00:33:56.140" style="s2">done has had a much much bigger effect</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.940" end="00:33:59.290" style="s2">on my idea of myself and my life then</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.140" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">and work but I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.290" end="00:34:04.120" style="s2">I mean paid labour that is that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:07.060" style="s2">done and and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.120" end="00:34:11.920" style="s2">something that a lot of people in my</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.060" end="00:34:15.310" style="s2">generation or probably probably relate</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.920" end="00:34:18.430" style="s2">to that I think people are moving more</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.310" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">and more towards seeing what as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.430" end="00:34:24.640" style="s2">an unfortunate necessity whereas in my</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:27.130" style="s2">parents generation I certainly see in my</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.640" end="00:34:30.490" style="s2">parents that work is kind of you&#39;d as</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.130" end="00:34:33.490" style="s2">the defining aspect of your life that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.490" end="00:34:35.110" style="s2">for I mean I think this is maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.490" end="00:34:39.070" style="s2">true for people who have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.110" end="00:34:43.960" style="s2">professions and you know for example my</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.070" end="00:34:47.110" style="s2">parents you know compute a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.960" end="00:34:50.290" style="s2">define your life other types of work but</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.110" end="00:34:52.690" style="s2">I certainly see in what I&#39;m doing bodies</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.290" end="00:34:54.520" style="s2">their life whereas I think in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.690" end="00:34:57.810" style="s2">my generation a lot of people myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.520" end="00:35:00.460" style="s2">included and the kind of see war is an</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.810" end="00:35:02.110" style="s2">unfortunate necessity so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.460" end="00:35:05.260" style="s2">make money so that you can then go and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.110" end="00:35:07.840" style="s2">do the things right you see is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:12.940" style="s2">defining you right no totally and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.840" end="00:35:15.130" style="s2">uh that is a shift and it is I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.940" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">unfortunate and part of the educational</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.130" end="00:35:20.350" style="s2">crisis right which is that in fact my</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:24.220" style="s2">contribution to civilization right my</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.350" end="00:35:26.980" style="s2">work is an unfortunate necessity what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.220" end="00:35:28.890" style="s2">really do is what I only get a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.980" end="00:35:32.260" style="s2">do with a very small portion of my time</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.890" end="00:35:34.150" style="s2">most of my time I have to spend dealing</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.260" end="00:35:37.720" style="s2">with this unfortunate necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.150" end="00:35:39.700" style="s2">civilization that sucks and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.720" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">experience you get in school right away</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.700" end="00:35:44.650" style="s2">many people</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">cool feels like itself like this job</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.650" end="00:35:48.190" style="s2">you&#39;re eventually gonna have school</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:51.309" style="s2">feels like an unfortunate necessity and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.190" end="00:35:56.740" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of habituated to tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.309" end="00:35:58.030" style="s2">these unfortunate necessity x&#39; and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.740" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">know freud classically wrote</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.030" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">civilization and its discontents and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:06.099" style="s2">know this argument that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:09.849" style="s2">unfortunate necessity this is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.099" end="00:36:15.609" style="s2">that kind of fergan view here that i</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.849" end="00:36:17.559" style="s2">like yes duck we&#39;re stuck in this i i</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.609" end="00:36:20.230" style="s2">don&#39;t think it needs to be that way and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.559" end="00:36:22.329" style="s2">this gets to basic issues of this time</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.230" end="00:36:25.380" style="s2">between worlds and the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.329" end="00:36:28.300" style="s2">create a social system that</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.380" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">participating in doesn&#39;t feel like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.300" end="00:36:34.180" style="s2">unfortunate necessity right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:36.460" style="s2">interesting because there are definitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.180" end="00:36:39.190" style="s2">a Shalom&#39;s within the capitalist world</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.460" end="00:36:41.890" style="s2">system the high ranking cronies as it</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.190" end="00:36:45.849" style="s2">were and some of the meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.890" end="00:36:48.819" style="s2">aristocrats who are freed to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.849" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">that they participates in civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.819" end="00:36:54.930" style="s2">in such a way that it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:57.970" style="s2">unnecessary or unfortunate necessity and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.930" end="00:37:00.130" style="s2">and so that&#39;s interesting that there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.970" end="00:37:03.579" style="s2">places where we can see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.130" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">possible right like where there are like</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.579" end="00:37:09.130" style="s2">these pockets and niches that occur</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:12.250" style="s2">where people are really aligned and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.130" end="00:37:15.430" style="s2">doing work that helps civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.250" end="00:37:17.650" style="s2">baize the bills and allows them to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.430" end="00:37:21.069" style="s2">doing something that doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.650" end="00:37:23.530" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t do it anyway yeah like if</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.069" end="00:37:25.030" style="s2">like if they had unlimited funds that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.530" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">they would still do this that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.030" end="00:37:29.380" style="s2">not just doing it for money right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.790" style="s2">again this is about what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.380" end="00:37:33.940" style="s2">understand yourself outside the context</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.790" end="00:37:37.829" style="s2">of a wage laborer it won&#39;t be to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.940" end="00:37:37.829" style="s2">growing up in school all along</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.859" end="00:37:42.040" style="s2">understanding as you&#39;re growing up that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.609" end="00:37:45.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to eventually work some</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.040" end="00:37:48.130" style="s2">job whether you like it or not there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.079" end="00:38:08.660" style="s2">perpetually like you&#39;re wasting your</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.660" end="00:38:12.470" style="s2">to make money all right that&#39;s it I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.470" end="00:38:17.869" style="s2">an economic reformer I&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.020" end="00:38:20.660" style="s2">you&#39;re sapping the lifeblood out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.869" end="00:38:22.910" style="s2">learning and schooling because of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.660" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">way of conceiving the ultimate goal of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.910" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">dull life and so there&#39;s a cynical</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:33.109" style="s2">acceptance that sets in which I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:35.569" style="s2">some of the younger generation who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.109" end="00:38:38.450" style="s2">kind of like loving the hustle have</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.569" end="00:38:41.480" style="s2">adopted where they&#39;re not particularly</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.240" end="00:39:06.109" style="s2">for your own self-interest and succeed</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.750" end="00:39:08.359" style="s2">by many metrics but ultimately not be</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.030" end="00:39:16.520" style="s2">requires it requires us understanding</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.150" end="00:39:31.900" style="s2">benefits and to create art and other</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.309" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">things that are based on a logic of non</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.900" end="00:39:39.319" style="s2">reciprocated care rather than pure</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:40.790" style="s2">transaction and so that is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.319" end="00:39:44.299" style="s2">characterized civilization that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.790" end="00:39:46.549" style="s2">rule of persuasion over force right the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.299" end="00:39:47.750" style="s2">rule of persuasion over force and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.549" end="00:39:51.829" style="s2">unforced course of the better argument</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.750" end="00:39:54.500" style="s2">rather than violence and that requires</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.829" end="00:39:56.809" style="s2">education so again I&#39;m a broken record</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.500" end="00:40:00.170" style="s2">of staff but I&#39;m an education class word</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.809" end="00:40:01.849" style="s2">that&#39;s what you get it really did</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.170" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">something came up when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.849" end="00:40:07.020" style="s2">about the idea of civilization in</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:09.300" style="s2">perpetuity and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.020" end="00:40:11.430" style="s2">I was thinking about I suppose like if</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.300" end="00:40:14.940" style="s2">there is a meta statement we give to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.430" end="00:40:17.100" style="s2">people about why you&#39;re doing education</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.940" end="00:40:18.690" style="s2">and I just think that I never really got</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.100" end="00:40:20.670" style="s2">that like I don&#39;t think it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.690" end="00:40:22.770" style="s2">particularly well explained to me while</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.670" end="00:40:24.780" style="s2">I went to school other than having the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.770" end="00:40:26.610" style="s2">odd argument with my mum basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.780" end="00:40:28.140" style="s2">saying he said why do I have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.610" end="00:40:31.860" style="s2">school so you can get a good job so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.140" end="00:40:34.050" style="s2">can earn money house right but why do I</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.860" end="00:40:36.540" style="s2">have to do that and then like I remember</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.050" end="00:40:38.250" style="s2">I had a bit well my undergrad years were</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.540" end="00:40:40.230" style="s2">characterized by a bit of existential</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.250" end="00:40:42.660" style="s2">crisis because I very nearly went to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.230" end="00:40:44.340" style="s2">study physics and then I had this moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.660" end="00:40:47.010" style="s2">outside this real intuitive sense like</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.340" end="00:40:49.260" style="s2">no studied classic study ancient</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.010" end="00:40:50.970" style="s2">literature study ancient poetry and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.260" end="00:40:53.010" style="s2">philosophy but the thing is I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.970" end="00:40:55.170" style="s2">have a clue why I wanted to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.010" end="00:40:57.210" style="s2">I spent two and a half three years there</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.170" end="00:40:59.190" style="s2">like well this is really cool but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.210" end="00:41:01.590" style="s2">still don&#39;t know why the I study</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.190" end="00:41:04.530" style="s2">no-one&#39;s explained to me why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.590" end="00:41:07.050" style="s2">studying this or what the vibe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.530" end="00:41:09.330" style="s2">a degree and fortunately I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.050" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">kind of worked it out by the time I</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.330" end="00:41:14.700" style="s2">started my monsters yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:17.580" style="s2">now I feel like I actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.700" end="00:41:20.550" style="s2">the history of Western culture and art</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.580" end="00:41:22.410" style="s2">and that feeds into the Renaissance in</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.550" end="00:41:23.910" style="s2">quite a deep way and that&#39;s cool but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.410" end="00:41:27.150" style="s2">wish someone had told me that from day</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.910" end="00:41:29.730" style="s2">one right well it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.150" end="00:41:32.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.730" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">problem that results from solving a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.040" end="00:41:36.600" style="s2">worse problem right so the modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2">innovation schooling is a result of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.600" end="00:41:39.810" style="s2">separation of church and state</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:42.780" style="s2">right so they&#39;re basically saying like</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.810" end="00:41:45.270" style="s2">hey no no we&#39;re exactly not telling you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.780" end="00:41:46.740" style="s2">the answer about everything yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.270" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">exactly not telling you what it all</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.740" end="00:41:51.030" style="s2">means right and now for a while it used</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:41:53.880" style="s2">to be we&#39;re telling you you&#39;re a citizen</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.030" end="00:41:56.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re you&#39;re an American damn it</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.880" end="00:41:57.870" style="s2">like that was that&#39;s how we solve the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.280" end="00:41:59.970" style="s2">problem of what it all means in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.870" end="00:42:01.950" style="s2">schools but eventually we stop trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.970" end="00:42:04.470" style="s2">answer what it all means all together</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.950" end="00:42:08.070" style="s2">and so that left the students with this</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.470" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">kind of yeah this sense of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.070" end="00:42:13.350" style="s2">unfortunate necessity that&#39;s never fully</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">explained except insofar as its</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.350" end="00:42:19.590" style="s2">instrumental value for future wage labor</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">now you&#39;ll get a couple of teachers cool</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.590" end="00:42:22.460" style="s2">like behind closed doors</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:25.170" style="s2">whisper in your ear and tell you now man</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.460" end="00:42:27.029" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing called like Bill doom</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.170" end="00:42:29.160" style="s2">or like self building or self</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.029" end="00:42:31.109" style="s2">development right that education is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.160" end="00:42:32.309" style="s2">end in itself and then if you build your</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.109" end="00:42:33.420" style="s2">capacities and insights and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.309" end="00:42:35.369" style="s2">understanding you&#39;ll find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.420" end="00:42:37.140" style="s2">contribute and but like there are people</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.369" end="00:42:38.490" style="s2">who are aware of this message but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.140" end="00:42:41.490" style="s2">predominant message is one of no you</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.490" end="00:42:43.380" style="s2">just do school visits they&#39;re like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.490" end="00:42:47.220" style="s2">kind of like a second nature that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.380" end="00:42:51.380" style="s2">created that you just go into and up and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.220" end="00:42:53.400" style="s2">out of and don&#39;t really question it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.380" end="00:42:56.009" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s interesting is that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.400" end="00:42:59.549" style="s2">smartest ones will want an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.009" end="00:43:02.430" style="s2">that question and so we misunderstand I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.549" end="00:43:06.420" style="s2">think attention-deficit sometimes as</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.430" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">actually just the tension produced by</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.420" end="00:43:11.099" style="s2">the answer to that but the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:13.589" style="s2">the answer to that question right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.099" end="00:43:14.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like why am I doing this why am I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.589" end="00:43:16.410" style="s2">doing this why am i doing this why am i</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.910" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">doing this and if no one actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.410" end="00:43:20.339" style="s2">answers that or if all the answers are</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">obviously not enough and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.339" end="00:43:27.930" style="s2">and I know that then there&#39;s in built-up</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:29.640" style="s2">tension in the mind body of an absence</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.930" end="00:43:31.349" style="s2">of an answer to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.640" end="00:43:32.519" style="s2">motivation of how I&#39;m spending most of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.349" end="00:43:36.750" style="s2">my time</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.519" end="00:43:39.269" style="s2">and so I think you know it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.750" end="00:43:40.920" style="s2">many kids are the ad D there are other</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.269" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">issues we&#39;ve got nutritional issues and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.920" end="00:43:44.730" style="s2">a whole bunch of things but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.670" style="s2">clear that where they really care about</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.730" end="00:43:49.619" style="s2">something like for example videogames or</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.670" end="00:43:51.779" style="s2">friendships or music or other things</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.619" end="00:43:56.039" style="s2">they&#39;ll actually get a lock in effect</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.779" end="00:43:58.559" style="s2">where you can tear them away and so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.039" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">shows that there&#39;s a pent-up desire to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.559" end="00:44:03.559" style="s2">actually really operate on the world and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:06.630" style="s2">to focus when there&#39;s a sense of why</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.559" end="00:44:08.670" style="s2">when it when the my motivation and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.630" end="00:44:12.740" style="s2">motivation of what I&#39;m doing aligns and</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.670" end="00:44:16.109" style="s2">it all feels right and I can do it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.740" end="00:44:18.599" style="s2">when that happens in schools and kids</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.109" end="00:44:20.509" style="s2">still can&#39;t focus then we can start</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.599" end="00:44:23.880" style="s2">talking about a problem with their brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.509" end="00:44:25.950" style="s2">but until we answer that question and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.880" end="00:44:27.809" style="s2">stop that loop of why am I doing this</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.950" end="00:44:30.390" style="s2">why am I doing this really stop that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.809" end="00:44:32.460" style="s2">loop to say you&#39;re doing this because we</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.390" end="00:44:34.730" style="s2">are humans because this is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.460" end="00:44:39.230" style="s2">our civilization because we value this</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.730" end="00:44:41.570" style="s2">XYZ and until we do that and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.230" end="00:44:45.650" style="s2">very hard to actually expect these kids</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.570" end="00:44:47.810" style="s2">to to try you know them that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.650" end="00:44:51.470" style="s2">about this the smartest most reflective</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.810" end="00:44:53.540" style="s2">most abstract and complex and some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.470" end="00:44:56.450" style="s2">the ones most wanting to benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.540" end="00:44:58.310" style="s2">help civilization are the ones who will</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.450" end="00:45:00.350" style="s2">be in school scratching their heads like</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.310" end="00:45:05.660" style="s2">Henry David Thoreau thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.350" end="00:45:08.360" style="s2">is all this around me and in general</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.660" end="00:45:10.580" style="s2">their response is not enough like</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.360" end="00:45:14.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not not coherent enough not</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.580" end="00:45:16.700" style="s2">forthcoming enough and many cases</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.110" end="00:45:19.340" style="s2">blatant lie because a lot of these kids</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.700" end="00:45:21.890" style="s2">know that there&#39;s no job waiting for me</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.340" end="00:45:23.960" style="s2">dude like look at these kids who were</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.890" end="00:45:26.210" style="s2">coming out of school where they go to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.960" end="00:45:28.550" style="s2">work like let&#39;s be realistic here</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.210" end="00:45:30.080" style="s2">like principal or whoever is telling me</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.550" end="00:45:31.490" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go get a great job like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.080" end="00:45:33.470" style="s2">be realistic about what the job</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.490" end="00:45:36.470" style="s2">prospects look like for degrees like</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.470" end="00:45:38.780" style="s2">mine versus the dead I&#39;m incurring</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.470" end="00:45:42.140" style="s2">coming on and so there&#39;s a basic problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.780" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">that we can&#39;t say good true and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.140" end="00:45:46.970" style="s2">beautiful things about the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">situation we&#39;re putting the youth in and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.970" end="00:45:50.690" style="s2">they know it and so of course we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:53.840" style="s2">paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.690" end="00:45:55.730" style="s2">oh they&#39;re paying a lot of attention to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.840" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">other things just not to you and not to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.730" end="00:46:01.850" style="s2">school until YouTube and they&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:04.280" style="s2">attention to social media and all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.850" end="00:46:06.080" style="s2">of things so again this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.280" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">dynamic of the educational crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.080" end="00:46:11.990" style="s2">what I call a legitimacy crisis which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:14.650" style="s2">the absence or inability to secure</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.990" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">political legitimacy or investment in</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.650" end="00:46:21.410" style="s2">the project of cooperation which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:24.380" style="s2">Society and that&#39;s one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.410" end="00:46:26.120" style="s2">education has to do or the center for</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.380" end="00:46:28.760" style="s2">the center falls apart and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.120" end="00:46:32.660" style="s2">intergenerational rift which is what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.760" end="00:46:36.140" style="s2">started off kind of talking about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.660" end="00:46:37.700" style="s2">so that&#39;s heavy you know he gets right</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.140" end="00:46:39.740" style="s2">back to your and I experienced it in</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.700" end="00:46:41.030" style="s2">school too but as I said I was just like</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.740" end="00:46:44.750" style="s2">sick and so I had already kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.030" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">not identified with school and so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.750" end="00:46:49.060" style="s2">lucked out</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:51.640" style="s2">but if I really wanted to succeed by</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.060" end="00:46:54.069" style="s2">virtue of the tests in high school and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.640" end="00:46:55.450" style="s2">the SAT and a few other things but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.069" end="00:46:57.640" style="s2">really wanted to succeed in that way I</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.450" end="00:46:59.500" style="s2">would have been destroyed before I had</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.640" end="00:47:00.730" style="s2">an opportunity to discover my gifts and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.500" end="00:47:03.310" style="s2">it was those gifts that allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.730" end="00:47:06.339" style="s2">get up and eventually into higher</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.310" end="00:47:09.730" style="s2">education in like upper echelon kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.339" end="00:47:12.430" style="s2">Harvard style but I snuck in basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.730" end="00:47:16.089" style="s2">I&#39;m telling you guys because I made</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.430" end="00:47:17.829" style="s2">relationships with key professors I had</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.089" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">no GPA because I went to a school that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.829" end="00:47:22.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t have tests and grades and true</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:28.089" style="s2">College which is now falling apart and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.180" end="00:47:29.890" style="s2">dying and I also you know bombed the GRE</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.089" end="00:47:32.140" style="s2">I&#39;m because I&#39;m just like psycho</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.890" end="00:47:33.640" style="s2">terrible test taker so by normal</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.140" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">standards of the educational system I</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.640" end="00:47:41.650" style="s2">was a failure and kind of always did</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:43.710" style="s2">just mediocre enough and so that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.650" end="00:47:46.060" style="s2">how I&#39;m basically perceived by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.710" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">standards and measures of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.060" end="00:47:51.339" style="s2">traditional system I managed to find</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:54.430" style="s2">niches and get through by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.339" end="00:47:57.940" style="s2">basically you know luck and grace I</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.430" end="00:48:02.619" style="s2">would say more so than my own tenacity I</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.940" end="00:48:06.579" style="s2">certainly you know felt like it was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.619" end="00:48:08.829" style="s2">gift rather than anything else but most</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.579" end="00:48:10.599" style="s2">people in my situation who reflect as</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.829" end="00:48:13.240" style="s2">early an age as I did about how the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.599" end="00:48:16.300" style="s2">whole thing is feels like it&#39;s rigged</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.240" end="00:48:18.819" style="s2">against me or something like that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.300" end="00:48:21.339" style="s2">never would end up getting into graduate</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.819" end="00:48:23.710" style="s2">school or anything of that nature just</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.339" end="00:48:26.730" style="s2">by virtue of how the cookie crumbles</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.710" end="00:48:30.130" style="s2">so I think yeah where we are in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.730" end="00:48:32.290" style="s2">we are false positives and false</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.130" end="00:48:33.849" style="s2">negatives in the sorting mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.290" end="00:48:35.230" style="s2">the educational system which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.849" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">that many of our best and brightest are</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.230" end="00:48:40.780" style="s2">not getting found and getting the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:43.660" style="s2">resources they need and many of our most</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.780" end="00:48:46.510" style="s2">conventional kind of growth thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.660" end="00:48:49.300" style="s2">kind of game a success oriented ones are</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.510" end="00:48:53.460" style="s2">getting rising through the bureaucracies</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.300" end="00:48:57.160" style="s2">and into positions of power and prestige</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.460" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">and so yeah we are that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.160" end="00:49:00.619" style="s2">educational</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:01.730" style="s2">is also their capability crisis can we</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.619" end="00:49:03.829" style="s2">get the right people with the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.730" end="00:49:06.289" style="s2">capabilities into the right positions in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.829" end="00:49:07.609" style="s2">civilization so there doesn&#39;t break and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.289" end="00:49:09.559" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing the education</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.609" end="00:49:11.990" style="s2">system is supposed to do it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.559" end="00:49:13.789" style="s2">route those people oh you&#39;re the truly</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.990" end="00:49:15.710" style="s2">responsible highly capable a reflective</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.789" end="00:49:17.960" style="s2">one you should be in that position right</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.710" end="00:49:20.569" style="s2">oh you&#39;re the political power hungry one</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.960" end="00:49:22.039" style="s2">who can&#39;t actually do abstract thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.569" end="00:49:25.760" style="s2">you should be in this position but if we</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.039" end="00:49:26.390" style="s2">flip those and the power-hungry simple</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.760" end="00:49:29.059" style="s2">thinker</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.390" end="00:49:31.099" style="s2">who&#39;s manipulative gets put in a highly</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.059" end="00:49:32.029" style="s2">responsible high capacity position and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.099" end="00:49:33.319" style="s2">the person who&#39;s actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.029" end="00:49:34.940" style="s2">responsible and very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.319" end="00:49:37.940" style="s2">incapacitated puts in a low</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.940" end="00:49:40.029" style="s2">responsibility lower so that happens and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.940" end="00:49:43.369" style="s2">it&#39;s happening almost systematically</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.029" end="00:49:47.180" style="s2">and so that&#39;s not again bad sign that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.369" end="00:49:52.339" style="s2">bad sign for educational systems in</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.180" end="00:49:55.160" style="s2">particular I suddenly remember what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.339" end="00:49:58.279" style="s2">was in school kind of having a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.160" end="00:50:00.589" style="s2">psychology almost to basically like I go</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.279" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">to school and I do my homework and I try</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.589" end="00:50:04.220" style="s2">to do well on pests more or less</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:10.069" style="s2">entirely just so that people don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.220" end="00:50:13.010" style="s2">angry at me don&#39;t do that that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.069" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">motivation for you yeah good job 10</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.010" end="00:50:16.430" style="s2">years 15 years so now&#39;s not actually a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">real motivation give me what I know</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.430" end="00:50:19.579" style="s2">about a lesson development and their</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">brain and the frontal cortex they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.579" end="00:50:23.690" style="s2">actually able to think on decade-long</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:25.910" style="s2">timelines but they can think about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.690" end="00:50:28.970" style="s2">weekend and yeah and not getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.910" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">grounded and so that ends up being where</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.970" end="00:50:33.319" style="s2">the rubber hits the road with motivation</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:34.789" style="s2">in schooling usually early it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.319" end="00:50:36.680" style="s2">have to do my homework because my</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.789" end="00:50:39.619" style="s2">parents are gonna take away my xbox if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.680" end="00:50:41.569" style="s2">don&#39;t exactly I know you know it took on</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.619" end="00:50:43.309" style="s2">the one hand you can see this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.569" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">thinking in terms of how do you get a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.309" end="00:50:49.940" style="s2">child to do homework that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:52.490" style="s2">functionalist sort of like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.940" end="00:50:55.160" style="s2">objective how do we force him to do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.490" end="00:50:58.339" style="s2">instead of like if you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.160" end="00:50:59.900" style="s2">similar logic to I mean yeah this kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.339" end="00:51:02.180" style="s2">it makes a lot of sense I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.900" end="00:51:04.309" style="s2">similar logic to sort of wage labor</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.180" end="00:51:07.010" style="s2">which is hmm we have all these dogs that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.309" end="00:51:09.770" style="s2">no one really wants a together trailer</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.010" end="00:51:11.180" style="s2">society so that some people have to do</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.040" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">interesting why is the explanation</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.720" end="00:51:21.560" style="s2">enjoyable the Xbox is actually enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:23.570" style="s2">because of the way the videogame is</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.560" end="00:51:26.690" style="s2">designed where you get the thrill of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.570" end="00:51:29.000" style="s2">learning and success yeah and like they</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.690" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">did a lot of research so no one actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.000" end="00:51:32.930" style="s2">has to use external motivation to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:36.440" style="s2">you to play xbox because they did</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.930" end="00:51:38.810" style="s2">literally research in the doughnuts that</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.930" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">sequencing so that the experience of the</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.350" end="00:52:07.790" style="s2">success that comes from learning so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.300" end="00:52:09.370" style="s2">video games have actually captured the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.790" end="00:52:11.980" style="s2">attention and learning mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.370" end="00:52:15.890" style="s2">through good research and development of</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.890" end="00:52:24.290" style="s2">failed to do that and now they could</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:27.040" style="s2">have if they had let&#39;s say maybe twice</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.040" end="00:52:31.880" style="s2">the video game industry is just twice</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.500" end="00:52:35.690" style="s2">which would be like some very small</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.880" end="00:52:38.510" style="s2">fraction of let&#39;s say a defense industry</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.690" end="00:52:40.250" style="s2">spending right so there&#39;s a failure of</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.510" end="00:52:41.570" style="s2">imagination about what&#39;s possible I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.250" end="00:52:43.910" style="s2">think with public schooling and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.570" end="00:52:45.950" style="s2">ultimately my book is about getting a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.910" end="00:52:47.990" style="s2">very different kind of educational</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.950" end="00:52:50.590" style="s2">system based around educational hub</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.970" end="00:53:16.600" style="s2">think we have to think outside of the</p>
