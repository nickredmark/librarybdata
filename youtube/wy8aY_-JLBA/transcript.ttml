<p begin="00:00:09.490" end="00:00:16.359" style="s2">we can find new ways to all understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.450" end="00:00:18.630" style="s2">one another rebel wisdom is an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.359" end="00:00:22.150" style="s2">conversation the main topics of it are</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.630" end="00:00:25.210" style="s2">the challenge of sense making the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.150" end="00:00:26.499" style="s2">sense that our sense making institutions</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.210" end="00:00:29.109" style="s2">are breaking down at an ever-increasing</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.499" end="00:00:31.060" style="s2">rate this sense that there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.109" end="00:00:33.070" style="s2">neglected perspectives and ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.060" end="00:00:35.470" style="s2">also the that that a lot of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.070" end="00:00:37.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve run society is breaking down and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.470" end="00:00:39.070" style="s2">these I we need to find new ideas from</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.270" end="00:00:40.690" style="s2">somewhere this is something I think is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.070" end="00:00:43.840" style="s2">being increasingly obvious to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.690" end="00:00:47.260" style="s2">that something about society is is off</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.840" end="00:00:50.590" style="s2">and being increasingly recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.260" end="00:00:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s off and the only way out is to to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.590" end="00:00:54.070" style="s2">bring in some new ideas some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.960" end="00:00:55.240" style="s2">ideas that have been sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.070" end="00:00:58.450" style="s2">fringe of the culture and have never</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.240" end="00:01:00.520" style="s2">been part of the culture and we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.450" end="00:01:02.200" style="s2">lucky that some of the speakers are</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.520" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">bringing the speakers we have here are</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.200" end="00:01:09.159" style="s2">bringing some of those perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:12.280" style="s2">we&#39;re poised in a way for catastrophe or</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.159" end="00:01:15.100" style="s2">transformation and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.280" end="00:01:16.690" style="s2">becoming more and more clear and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.100" end="00:01:18.340" style="s2">a lot of people are intuitive that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.690" end="00:01:19.690" style="s2">there&#39;s very different ways that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.340" end="00:01:21.010" style="s2">that that&#39;s showing up and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.690" end="00:01:23.409" style="s2">different narrative about how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.010" end="00:01:26.409" style="s2">showing up but I think we all sense that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.409" end="00:01:29.260" style="s2">something shifting an old way is coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.409" end="00:01:32.110" style="s2">to an end and something new could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.260" end="00:01:34.120" style="s2">born as a journalist I&#39;m very familiar</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.110" end="00:01:37.299" style="s2">and driven by this idea of speaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.120" end="00:01:39.340" style="s2">truth to power in the social media age a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.299" end="00:01:42.070" style="s2">lot of this power is kind of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.340" end="00:01:43.510" style="s2">its its social shaming it&#39;s the power of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.070" end="00:01:46.119" style="s2">the mob it&#39;s the power of not being able</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.510" end="00:01:47.890" style="s2">to to say certain things how do we think</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.119" end="00:01:49.330" style="s2">in public if every time we sort of don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.890" end="00:01:51.159" style="s2">express ourselves perfectly or we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.330" end="00:01:53.440" style="s2">give enough context that we&#39;re attacked</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.159" end="00:01:57.310" style="s2">and we kind of learn not to say certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.440" end="00:01:59.080" style="s2">things so this there is something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.310" end="00:02:00.820" style="s2">needs to happen with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.080" end="00:02:02.170" style="s2">increased polarization especially driven</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.820" end="00:02:04.479" style="s2">by social media that we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.170" end="00:02:05.890" style="s2">spaces to have these conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.479" end="00:02:07.990" style="s2">we feel that we&#39;re not able to express</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.890" end="00:02:10.300" style="s2">and to make mistakes and to say things</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.990" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">wrong to be challenged and to to not</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.300" end="00:02:15.159" style="s2">feel that that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:16.360" style="s2">career ending there is a what the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.159" end="00:02:19.239" style="s2">that we need to talk about for sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.360" end="00:02:23.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a definite what to be described</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">but the how is as important the how is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.159" end="00:02:29.110" style="s2">why we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:31.150" style="s2">is this event it&#39;s not enough to come</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.110" end="00:02:33.099" style="s2">out these problems intellectually it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.150" end="00:02:34.900" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t work we need to come at it</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.099" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">with an understanding of that physiology</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.900" end="00:02:39.549" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a few useful models one</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">is polyvagal theory which talks about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.549" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">the vagus nerve and its role in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:48.549" style="s2">nervous systems role in effectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:51.099" style="s2">putting us into either a defensive mode</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.549" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">where we feel under threat and we shut</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.099" end="00:02:56.049" style="s2">down we start thinking differently we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:57.909" style="s2">less open to new ideas and we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.049" end="00:02:59.260" style="s2">defending ourselves and that that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.909" end="00:03:00.760" style="s2">know we can see that when we fall into</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.260" end="00:03:01.989" style="s2">an ideological position or a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.760" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">fixed position it&#39;s like not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.989" end="00:03:06.549" style="s2">budging it&#39;s not safe to budge so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:10.299" style="s2">need to understand how we can let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.549" end="00:03:13.209" style="s2">hack our bodies and come into a more</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.299" end="00:03:15.700" style="s2">relaxed exploratory mode and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.209" end="00:03:18.430" style="s2">we&#39;re also going to be using some</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.700" end="00:03:22.090" style="s2">techniques today to help us get into</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.430" end="00:03:24.370" style="s2">that mode help us relax help us activate</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.090" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">our parasympathetic nervous system which</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.370" end="00:03:29.560" style="s2">is the rest and digest is the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.849" style="s2">of the sympathetic nervous system where</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.560" end="00:03:34.840" style="s2">we&#39;re feeling in fight or flight or</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.849" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">freeze and we know that from that space</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.840" end="00:03:38.829" style="s2">for the fight-or-flight we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:40.870" style="s2">productive generative conversation it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.829" end="00:03:43.959" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t work we have to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.870" end="00:03:45.819" style="s2">space of relaxation and curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.959" end="00:03:48.639" style="s2">there&#39;s also another really key term</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.819" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">we&#39;re not entirely sure in that space</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.639" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">what the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.819" end="00:03:56.980" style="s2">I just like to ask you each to talk for</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.730" end="00:04:00.280" style="s2">a couple of minutes about what you want</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.980" end="00:04:02.590" style="s2">to achieve it&#39;s a little hard to put my</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.280" end="00:04:04.180" style="s2">finger on but I do think based on what</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.590" end="00:04:08.349" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen over the last two years that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.180" end="00:04:10.750" style="s2">there is some sort of a reorganization</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.349" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">of alliances there&#39;s an awakening</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.750" end="00:04:16.539" style="s2">happening and a change in allegiances</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">where people are realizing that those</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.539" end="00:04:21.280" style="s2">that have traditionally been their</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">allies may not be natural allies and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.280" end="00:04:24.849" style="s2">people that they have viewed with</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:28.060" style="s2">suspicion may be closer to them than</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.849" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">they had expected the problem is in</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.060" end="00:04:33.789" style="s2">order for those alliances to function</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:35.740" style="s2">you have to learn how people on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.789" end="00:04:38.229" style="s2">other side of them actually think and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.740" end="00:04:41.259" style="s2">this is very perilous the remedy</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.229" end="00:04:43.270" style="s2">involves us talking to each other enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.259" end="00:04:46.270" style="s2">that we begin to understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.270" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">other person&#39;s cognitive model is and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.270" end="00:04:51.099" style="s2">see the hope for bootstrapping our way</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:54.940" style="s2">out of the predicament that we humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.099" end="00:04:57.820" style="s2">are in that hope arises from our hearing</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.940" end="00:05:00.419" style="s2">each other enough to develop a shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.820" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">model that will allow us to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.419" end="00:05:07.180" style="s2">provocative things that are true and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">then act on the basis of that we all</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.180" end="00:05:12.610" style="s2">could use more humanizing of each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:14.860" style="s2">we are we&#39;re all someone&#39;s deplorable</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.610" end="00:05:20.860" style="s2">and probably right</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.860" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">if you describe any brief brief ideology</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.860" end="00:05:27.849" style="s2">to which we appear to subscribe and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:31.090" style="s2">think the greatest failures in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.849" end="00:05:34.270" style="s2">communication happen when we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.090" end="00:05:36.070" style="s2">allowed those ideas about each other to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.270" end="00:05:38.050" style="s2">get in the way of actually remembering</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.070" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">that every single person that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.050" end="00:05:45.849" style="s2">interact with is just as human and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:48.220" style="s2">sometimes brave and sometimes scared and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.849" end="00:05:51.460" style="s2">sometimes certain and sometimes quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.220" end="00:05:56.099" style="s2">uncertain as the being that you are in</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.460" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">your own head every single one of us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.099" end="00:06:01.240" style="s2">what I have seen is the biggest failures</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:05.340" style="s2">of communication</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.240" end="00:06:10.449" style="s2">bethey when mod rule came to our campus</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.340" end="00:06:12.340" style="s2">it was clear that there was dehumanizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.449" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">that happened first so the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.340" end="00:06:19.030" style="s2">conversations we can have in which we</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:21.310" style="s2">look people in the eyes and learn learn</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.030" end="00:06:22.569" style="s2">the human on the other side the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.310" end="00:06:26.770" style="s2">likely we are to be able to take that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.569" end="00:06:29.880" style="s2">out into the world and not view anyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.770" end="00:06:33.940" style="s2">no matter what their views may be as</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.880" end="00:06:37.800" style="s2">caricature first would be a hope that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.940" end="00:06:41.050" style="s2">can each of us be supported and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.800" end="00:06:44.620" style="s2">discovering more deeply and be brought</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.050" end="00:06:46.949" style="s2">into more insight into that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">the larger story of the desires</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.949" end="00:06:55.539" style="s2">specifically to hold and to be renewed</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:07:00.970" style="s2">in our hope in the context of that</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.970" end="00:07:07.659" style="s2">revolves perhaps feeling a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.509" end="00:07:10.750" style="s2">there being an insight that is larger</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.659" end="00:07:13.539" style="s2">than ourselves that is also present I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.750" end="00:07:18.870" style="s2">would like to see people go away feeling</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.539" end="00:07:18.870" style="s2">a little more confident in being able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.930" end="00:07:24.969" style="s2">close reports a little I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.909" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">extraordinary that when I was growing up</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.969" end="00:07:30.940" style="s2">and I&#39;m much older than anybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.320" style="s2">50s and 60s it seemed to me that we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.940" end="00:07:35.289" style="s2">entering an era in which there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.320" end="00:07:37.479" style="s2">enormous freedom and dig it was and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.289" end="00:07:39.719" style="s2">it&#39;s rather paradoxical that we now find</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.479" end="00:07:42.070" style="s2">ourselves in one of the more constrained</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.719" end="00:07:47.020" style="s2">intellectual environments I never saw</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.070" end="00:07:51.699" style="s2">this coming and I think that being able</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.020" end="00:07:54.669" style="s2">to take an unpopular position should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.699" end="00:07:58.630" style="s2">something we can all do without fear of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.669" end="00:08:01.630" style="s2">being dehumanized I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.630" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">nothing that cannot be said it&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.630" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">in which it said so I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:08.320" style="s2">should censor content I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:10.120" style="s2">send some manner and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.320" end="00:08:11.180" style="s2">everything can be said as long as people</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.120" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">say it in a respect</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.180" end="00:08:15.139" style="s2">away and one of my very strong beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:17.810" style="s2">is competition is certainly part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.139" end="00:08:19.550" style="s2">history of all life but equally</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.810" end="00:08:22.280" style="s2">important or I would say more about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.550" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">collaboration and that actually all life</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.280" end="00:08:26.810" style="s2">is a matter of collaboration your body</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:29.180" style="s2">is a lot of bacteria that decided</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.810" end="00:08:31.610" style="s2">altruistically to get together and serve</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.180" end="00:08:34.190" style="s2">a common purpose everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.610" end="00:08:37.310" style="s2">living does so because it collaborates</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.190" end="00:08:39.430" style="s2">and I would like us to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.310" end="00:08:41.690" style="s2">collaborate on things that are true and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.430" end="00:08:43.520" style="s2">beautiful and if we do that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.690" end="00:08:46.850" style="s2">might get ourselves out of the hole we</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.520" end="00:08:48.529" style="s2">dug ourselves into it&#39;s important to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.850" end="00:08:50.029" style="s2">people into smaller groups because we</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.529" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">have 150 people here attending the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.029" end="00:08:53.990" style="s2">summit and in a group of that size it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:56.149" style="s2">really difficult to create that level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.990" end="00:08:57.800" style="s2">intimacy and connection and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.149" end="00:09:00.770" style="s2">understanding that you get in a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.800" end="00:09:02.600" style="s2">group of say 10 where we can really get</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.770" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">a sense of even in a day we can get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.600" end="00:09:05.720" style="s2">sense of the other people in the group</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">we can get a sense of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.720" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">bringing who they are and we build a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">certain trust and a word we use as</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.250" style="s2">coherence where we&#39;re a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:14.990" style="s2">of a coherence with one another I</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.250" end="00:09:16.520" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re saying you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.990" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">understand what I&#39;m saying you might not</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.520" end="00:09:19.550" style="s2">agree with me but at least we&#39;re meeting</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:21.620" style="s2">each other as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.550" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">so so on one level of surround intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.620" end="00:09:24.770" style="s2">and the other level that&#39;s around it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:28.790" style="s2">much easier to have a conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.770" end="00:09:32.360" style="s2">smaller the group gets as Ali said we</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.790" end="00:09:33.950" style="s2">spent the morning building building up</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.360" end="00:09:35.690" style="s2">to what we&#39;re going to do now sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.950" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">got to know each other a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.690" end="00:09:42.500" style="s2">our small groups and made some</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:44.810" style="s2">connections and that&#39;s to build up the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">the safety and the connection to do what</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.810" end="00:09:49.760" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do now and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">about before about sort of feeling how</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.760" end="00:09:52.790" style="s2">feelings stifled around certain topics</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:54.339" style="s2">and certain things that were allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.790" end="00:09:56.540" style="s2">express and we&#39;re not allowed to express</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.339" end="00:09:58.790" style="s2">certainly kind of made much worse by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.540" end="00:10:01.400" style="s2">kind of low bandwidth of social media is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.790" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">a real is a real issue that thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.400" end="00:10:05.630" style="s2">public has become very dangerous because</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:08.450" style="s2">things can be taken out of context and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.630" end="00:10:11.100" style="s2">for that reason we are going to turn the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.450" end="00:10:14.180" style="s2">cameras off now</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.100" end="00:10:17.009" style="s2">we shut off the cameras in the main room</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.180" end="00:10:18.660" style="s2">because the invitation to the speakers</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.009" end="00:10:20.820" style="s2">and everyone else was to have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.660" end="00:10:22.860" style="s2">conversation around things we don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.820" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">comfortable talking about in public and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.860" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">that felt much easier to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:29.009" style="s2">cameras off so right now that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:31.130" style="s2">what everyone&#39;s doing here the speakers</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.009" end="00:10:33.209" style="s2">modeled that up on stage and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.130" end="00:10:35.970" style="s2">discussed a variety of topics that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.209" end="00:10:37.980" style="s2">aren&#39;t really we&#39;re not able to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.970" end="00:10:39.569" style="s2">easily in public either through social</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.980" end="00:10:41.819" style="s2">pressure or because there are quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.569" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">complex but but mainly because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.819" end="00:10:47.100" style="s2">stifled in some sense by a mob mentality</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:49.350" style="s2">that we&#39;re afraid to activate in order</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.100" end="00:10:50.699" style="s2">to really kind of reach truth with one</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.350" end="00:10:52.199" style="s2">another we have to kind of take that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.699" end="00:10:55.019" style="s2">risk to not really have a fully-formed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.199" end="00:10:57.509" style="s2">idea to not quite know the you know have</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.019" end="00:11:00.930" style="s2">a sense of something but not quite there</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.509" end="00:11:03.000" style="s2">and also to be able to keep a balance in</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.930" end="00:11:04.649" style="s2">ourselves of monitoring our own</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.000" end="00:11:07.079" style="s2">responses and reactions so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.649" end="00:11:08.310" style="s2">be calm we can listen properly even if</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.079" end="00:11:10.110" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about or listening to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.310" end="00:11:14.540" style="s2">really challenging idea that that might</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.110" end="00:11:14.540" style="s2">be so different to what we think</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:20.330" style="s2">topics the speakers were you know they</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.200" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">got a heavy territory which is great and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.330" end="00:11:26.080" style="s2">a lot to reflect on and I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:29.150" style="s2">motivated you know without that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.080" end="00:11:31.610" style="s2">panic so that that healthy sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.150" end="00:11:33.110" style="s2">urgency leaving this session today it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.610" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">been great for giving people a real</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.020" end="00:11:50.980" style="s2">bigger questions of our age we nominally</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.410" end="00:11:54.140" style="s2">share a language but because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.980" end="00:11:57.470" style="s2">we live that language is a blunt</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.140" end="00:11:59.270" style="s2">instrument and so events like this that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.470" end="00:12:01.220" style="s2">caused people to look at how they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.270" end="00:12:03.980" style="s2">communicating what it is that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.220" end="00:12:07.279" style="s2">convey and in what way they might reach</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.980" end="00:12:11.060" style="s2">across unbridgeable gaps more</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:14.089" style="s2">effectively these are perhaps the key to</p>
