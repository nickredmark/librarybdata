<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.629" style="s2">hello welcome to today&#39;s solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.460" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">raising today we are tackling a more</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.629" end="00:00:10.980" style="s2">complex topic comfortable topic of</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:13.019" style="s2">prisons and I honestly don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.980" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">we are gonna come up with this topic was</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.019" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">chosen before the murder of George Floyd</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">so I want to reiterate that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:20.670" style="s2">probably going to be talking about race</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">because I can&#39;t imagine getting through</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.670" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">talking about prisons without I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">you have done it on service but a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:28.769" style="s2">solution are we seen we spend an hour</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">talking about that topic we spend 15</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.769" end="00:00:31.710" style="s2">minutes talking about what it currently</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:34.219" style="s2">looks like what we like what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.710" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">like about it what&#39;s working what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.219" end="00:00:38.309" style="s2">15 minutes talking about our beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:39.690" style="s2">version of a future that we would love</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.309" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">to see happen and they don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.690" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">match and then we spend half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:46.680" style="s2">talking about what we could do with</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:48.750" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 and prisons</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">is a hard one to tackle with that but</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:53.460" style="s2">I&#39;m interested to see what we could come</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:56.460" style="s2">up with that moves that forward in any</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.460" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">way and it what it is today so if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.460" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">would like to start sharing what how</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:08.010" style="s2">they see the prison system right now and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">I can always start future I mean I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.010" end="00:01:11.610" style="s2">always start to but I said pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">always do so I&#39;m and I&#39;m waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.610" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">somebody else to jump in for a change</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:19.560" style="s2">all right I will I could quit and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">okay so prisons oh my goodness but just</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.560" end="00:01:24.150" style="s2">because I was actually prepared to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">about racism and I was also like there</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">is a disproportionate amount of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:29.549" style="s2">people in prison there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">disproportionate amount of black people</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.549" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">in the state&#39;s disproportional amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">First Nations in Canada and I&#39;m sure in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">the states as well and there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:40.020" style="s2">lot of people with neurodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">a lot of people with mental illness a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.020" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">lot of people with physical disabilities</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">in prison per the population basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">it is the position of prison is to keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">people away from society and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">good part of that I don&#39;t want murderers</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">and rapists running around amongst us</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s also now we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">think about them and they&#39;re away and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">who we put in that category right but</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">it&#39;s smoking a joint you got you there</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:10.489" style="s2">in some places and the level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:13.700" style="s2">criminality as well as our we are our</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.489" end="00:02:15.770" style="s2">criminals in prison so they can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:17.629" style="s2">punished or they therefore reform</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.770" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think we can do both and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.629" end="00:02:21.170" style="s2">I think we concentrate on punishment</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">there&#39;s of course the whole funnel</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.170" end="00:02:24.860" style="s2">leading into the prison system and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:27.319" style="s2">funnel leading out of the prison system</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.860" end="00:02:29.830" style="s2">who gets there is all of the stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.319" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">the racism and disability and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.830" end="00:02:34.849" style="s2">classism for sure and then when you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:36.950" style="s2">out have any criminal records like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.849" end="00:02:37.790" style="s2">already had a hard time now you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.950" end="00:02:39.380" style="s2">prison and now you have a criminal</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.790" end="00:02:41.420" style="s2">record now you can&#39;t vote and have a say</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.380" end="00:02:43.069" style="s2">in anything and so although prison is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.420" end="00:02:44.599" style="s2">kind of what we&#39;re focusing this on I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.069" end="00:02:46.459" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can talk about it without</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.599" end="00:02:50.060" style="s2">the funnel going in and the funnel you</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.459" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">know as well and so that is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.060" end="00:02:54.799" style="s2">what I want to share on prisons is of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.880" end="00:02:57.049" style="s2">course the criminal justice system whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.799" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">legal like it pertains to everything but</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.049" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">who else would like to share adequate</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.660" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a few things actually which</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.860" end="00:03:08.599" style="s2">occurred to me while you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:10.280" style="s2">so yeah the notion of the record is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.599" end="00:03:13.790" style="s2">really is a really important thing right</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.280" end="00:03:15.650" style="s2">it&#39;s such a it&#39;s such a handicap for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.790" end="00:03:18.230" style="s2">rest of your life once you&#39;re stamped as</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.650" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">a criminal of any kind and certain types</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.230" end="00:03:22.549" style="s2">of criminal in particular and so it it</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:24.470" style="s2">almost removes any possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.549" end="00:03:25.880" style="s2">redemption and rehabilitation and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.470" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">turning your life around kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.880" end="00:03:31.579" style="s2">right so there that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:33.769" style="s2">something and what it&#39;s for is also a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.579" end="00:03:35.569" style="s2">really interesting question is it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.769" end="00:03:36.650" style="s2">punish people like take their freedom</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.569" end="00:03:37.880" style="s2">away from them and lock them up as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:42.049" style="s2">form of punishment for their wrongdoing</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.880" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">or is it to keep dangerous people away</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.049" end="00:03:47.359" style="s2">from society at large right now I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.900" end="00:03:50.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit of both the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.359" end="00:03:52.069" style="s2">punishment thing yeah I guess I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.359" end="00:03:55.069" style="s2">depriving someone of their liberty is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.069" end="00:03:56.450" style="s2">pretty serious punishment and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.069" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">to me ought to be reserved for pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.450" end="00:04:01.190" style="s2">serious crimes and the type of poems</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">where you can&#39;t have that person</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.190" end="00:04:03.799" style="s2">wandering around inside you know it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">seems to me the punishment fitting the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.799" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">crime so if you steal something from</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:08.269" style="s2">someone then you go and do a few day&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:10.190" style="s2">work for them in order to repay the debt</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.269" end="00:04:11.930" style="s2">and also you now form a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.190" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">within this possibility of forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.930" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">and and what&#39;s it calls earn as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.290" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">process as a name for this process</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.420" end="00:04:22.840" style="s2">I can&#39;t think of it&#39;ll come to me at</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.710" end="00:04:26.060" style="s2">some point so yeah that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.840" end="00:04:28.250" style="s2">and my final point is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.060" end="00:04:29.690" style="s2">I&#39;m Jude Jubilee alluded to this but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.250" end="00:04:31.160" style="s2">just want to expand on it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.690" end="00:04:32.360" style="s2">is you know when you really put someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.160" end="00:04:34.100" style="s2">in prison you can kind of forget well</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.360" end="00:04:35.660" style="s2">they&#39;re a bad person we put them in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.100" end="00:04:38.410" style="s2">prison they&#39;ve done their time they come</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.660" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">out blah blah blah blah blah but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.410" end="00:04:44.780" style="s2">social circumstances which will have led</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:46.520" style="s2">them to some degree or another you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.780" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">argue about to what degree but to some</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.520" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">degree or other to commit those crimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:51.500" style="s2">in the first place I mean it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">almost universal that people who abuse</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.500" end="00:04:55.760" style="s2">their children were themselves abused as</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:57.980" style="s2">children right and so you know things</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.760" end="00:05:00.260" style="s2">like this is it is it actually right at</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.980" end="00:05:02.390" style="s2">all to consider the person perpetrating</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.260" end="00:05:05.290" style="s2">the crime as a criminal when so often</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.390" end="00:05:07.700" style="s2">actually they are victims just</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.290" end="00:05:11.690" style="s2">recreating the cycle you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.700" end="00:05:13.490" style="s2">mean and and so yeah I I will get onto</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.690" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">this later on but it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:17.060" style="s2">the emphasis is entirely in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:18.440" style="s2">place you know that you put all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.060" end="00:05:20.390" style="s2">blame on the person who committed the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.440" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">act and none of the blame it&#39;s all on</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.390" end="00:05:25.310" style="s2">the society that that produced that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:26.540" style="s2">person right that&#39;s that&#39;s it that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.310" end="00:05:32.260" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.540" end="00:05:34.970" style="s2">I guess I&#39;ll go um I have to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.260" end="00:05:38.840" style="s2">most of what both of you have said and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.970" end="00:05:42.290" style="s2">also like to add that for me I believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.840" end="00:05:44.650" style="s2">that our education system also adds to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.290" end="00:05:47.030" style="s2">this because you&#39;re you start to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.650" end="00:05:49.490" style="s2">graded or either you&#39;re good or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.030" end="00:05:51.950" style="s2">bad at a very young age and we start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.490" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">have a complex about that as it you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.950" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">you internalize it and you think you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:58.790" style="s2">bad and then you start to feel like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.310" end="00:06:00.830" style="s2">don&#39;t fit in in this a group or the rich</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.790" end="00:06:03.950" style="s2">people or the sporty people or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.830" end="00:06:05.930" style="s2">so then you kind of start associating</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.950" end="00:06:09.740" style="s2">yourself with the bad people or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.930" end="00:06:12.020" style="s2">which often can be taken and you can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.740" end="00:06:14.210" style="s2">taken advantage of because you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.020" end="00:06:16.130" style="s2">you young you still are impressionable</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.210" end="00:06:19.640" style="s2">but you have these powerful people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.130" end="00:06:24.140" style="s2">maybe have their own records that will</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.640" end="00:06:25.580" style="s2">try to use you to meet their needs in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.140" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">way because they think you&#39;re young</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.580" end="00:06:31.190" style="s2">you&#39;ll you know go to juvie you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">out you&#39;ll be fine but in reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.190" end="00:06:36.650" style="s2">just at the beginning of that whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:39.350" style="s2">system and and you can&#39;t it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.650" end="00:06:42.440" style="s2">difficult to get out of it I mean almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.350" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">impossible I agree with so much that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.440" end="00:06:47.170" style="s2">guys have already said and I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.170" style="s2">hear what dr. Noah has to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.260" end="00:06:57.650" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I have anything to add yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.230" end="00:06:59.790" style="s2">but when I do I&#39;ll say thanks Joshua I</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.650" end="00:07:01.410" style="s2">well Eric was talking I definitely had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.790" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">few other things come up one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.410" end="00:07:07.470" style="s2">the privatization of prisons Sheridan</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">actually suggested on the posting game</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.470" end="00:07:11.640" style="s2">be that that was kind of like that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:13.860" style="s2">could maybe have would I like an</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.640" end="00:07:15.270" style="s2">integral prison right and although part</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.860" end="00:07:16.830" style="s2">of my brain started running and I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.270" end="00:07:21.480" style="s2">like oh and not be awesome right got</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.830" end="00:07:23.760" style="s2">organic Gardens and the prisoner the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.480" end="00:07:25.320" style="s2">prison has a monopoly over your life and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.760" end="00:07:28.140" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to choose which prison you</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.320" end="00:07:31.380" style="s2">go to and therefore even if you made one</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.140" end="00:07:32.940" style="s2">beautiful you&#39;re not actually solving it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.380" end="00:07:34.770" style="s2">because the person doesn&#39;t get to choose</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.940" end="00:07:36.420" style="s2">right there isn&#39;t competition in prisons</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.770" end="00:07:39.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s the judges who decide where</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.420" end="00:07:42.180" style="s2">you go and that is is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.240" end="00:07:45.420" style="s2">there&#39;s supreme power that isn&#39;t checked</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.180" end="00:07:46.440" style="s2">the prison guards the prison what is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.420" end="00:07:47.700" style="s2">person in charge of the prison the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.440" end="00:07:49.890" style="s2">prison I can&#39;t remember what the name is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.700" end="00:07:51.150" style="s2">and the judges and how much morning</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.890" end="00:07:52.590" style="s2">hey it&#39;s funny I didn&#39;t hear you because</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.150" end="00:07:55.500" style="s2">you&#39;re a mute but I thought it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.590" end="00:07:57.990" style="s2">bitter in it as well as the fact that no</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.500" end="00:08:00.270" style="s2">matter how perfect your criminal justice</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.990" end="00:08:03.750" style="s2">system is there&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.270" end="00:08:05.730" style="s2">innocent people in prison and so we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.750" end="00:08:08.370" style="s2">to treat our prison population as</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.730" end="00:08:10.590" style="s2">they&#39;re innocent like duty and so if</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.370" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">we&#39;re punishing them right we know that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.590" end="00:08:13.710" style="s2">somewhat amongst them is innocent we</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:15.780" style="s2">can&#39;t really have a prison system where</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.710" end="00:08:17.880" style="s2">absolutely there&#39;s nobody in it and like</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.780" end="00:08:19.590" style="s2">if we have one at all it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.880" end="00:08:21.660" style="s2">there&#39;s no innocent people in it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.590" end="00:08:26.970" style="s2">guilty people running around free also</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.660" end="00:08:29.730" style="s2">right yeah yes absolutely and then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.970" end="00:08:32.280" style="s2">media and bias like we&#39;re seeing even we</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.730" end="00:08:32.820" style="s2">talk about education that the prison</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.280" end="00:08:35.430" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.820" end="00:08:38.310" style="s2">funnel into the prison system that our</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.430" end="00:08:40.530" style="s2">prison that our cops are racist and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.310" end="00:08:42.300" style="s2">ableist and classist and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.530" end="00:08:45.390" style="s2">it comes from a lot of what the media</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:47.070" style="s2">that they watch we see right now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.390" end="00:08:48.450" style="s2">a lot of hate crime towards Asians and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.070" end="00:08:53.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of hate crime even towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.450" end="00:08:55.890" style="s2">nurses and doctors and that&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.640" end="00:08:57.330" style="s2">months right of dealing with a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.890" end="00:09:00.330" style="s2">that you feel they&#39;re somehow</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.330" end="00:09:02.819" style="s2">responsible for doing that for decades</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.330" end="00:09:05.100" style="s2">for centuries like we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.819" end="00:09:07.199" style="s2">did overnight and yet the media plays</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.100" end="00:09:09.149" style="s2">into it the unconscious bias plays into</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.199" end="00:09:10.589" style="s2">it when you see someone perpetrate a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.149" end="00:09:12.899" style="s2">crime against you and then you start</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.589" end="00:09:15.509" style="s2">saying that people like that are in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.899" end="00:09:17.489" style="s2">category and therefore all those people</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.509" end="00:09:19.319" style="s2">are that makes somewhat sense when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.489" end="00:09:20.549" style="s2">your own your own world right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.319" end="00:09:23.069" style="s2">Olivia you&#39;re in a tribe you next to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.549" end="00:09:24.809" style="s2">another tribe those members there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.069" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">evolutionary reason we have that and at</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.809" end="00:09:31.559" style="s2">the same time our media feeds that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:33.299" style="s2">so seeing even if you never encounter</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.559" end="00:09:35.309" style="s2">let&#39;s say a black person in real life</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.299" end="00:09:37.379" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna rob you you encounter them</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.309" end="00:09:39.479" style="s2">time and time and time again on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.379" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">media doing that and so you start to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.479" end="00:09:43.949" style="s2">form these subconscious bias that those</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:45.779" style="s2">people are bad and those people are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.949" end="00:09:48.179" style="s2">problem even if you&#39;ve never encountered</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.779" end="00:09:52.049" style="s2">one and so there&#39;s this subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.179" end="00:09:53.459" style="s2">bias that comes in that we had that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.049" end="00:09:54.809" style="s2">again we have to kind of correct</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.459" end="00:09:55.979" style="s2">everything all at once it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.809" end="00:09:58.049" style="s2">prison system right it&#39;s the education</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.979" end="00:09:59.369" style="s2">it&#39;s the media it&#39;s all of it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.049" end="00:10:01.289" style="s2">political system it&#39;s how do we hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.369" end="00:10:03.569" style="s2">police accountable but I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.289" end="00:10:04.829" style="s2">get too broad for it but I did want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.569" end="00:10:08.879" style="s2">just say that that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.829" end="00:10:11.639" style="s2">that came up I just wanted to quickly</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.879" end="00:10:14.819" style="s2">add I completely agree with it being I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.639" end="00:10:18.389" style="s2">do not believe that prison system should</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.819" end="00:10:20.609" style="s2">be for profit in any way I just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.389" end="00:10:22.649" style="s2">sickening I feel the same about health</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.609" end="00:10:24.659" style="s2">care but I&#39;m much more concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.649" end="00:10:27.119" style="s2">the prison system because they can keep</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.659" end="00:10:28.949" style="s2">you trapped in this system any little</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.119" end="00:10:31.019" style="s2">thing you do wrong there and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.949" end="00:10:35.729" style="s2">making all this money off you and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.019" end="00:10:37.949" style="s2">paying for that a couple of judges who</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.729" end="00:10:39.899" style="s2">have been found guilty of taking</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.949" end="00:10:41.909" style="s2">backhanders from prison companies in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.899" end="00:10:43.589" style="s2">order to send kids to jail who really</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.909" end="00:10:44.869" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t agree had tiny nothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.589" end="00:10:47.100" style="s2">offenses you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.869" end="00:10:48.419" style="s2">they&#39;ve ended up spending years there</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.100" end="00:10:49.919" style="s2">and the prison companies made millions</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.419" end="00:10:50.999" style="s2">out there yeah I know but this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.919" end="00:10:52.439" style="s2">exactly what happens when you start</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.999" end="00:10:56.039" style="s2">swing center by sending people to jail</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.439" end="00:10:59.249" style="s2">right inevitable are we mainly talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.039" end="00:11:01.889" style="s2">about the u.s. here no prison system in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.249" end="00:11:03.989" style="s2">Canada though I don&#39;t I don&#39;t you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.889" end="00:11:05.459" style="s2">clients of prisons exist in many other</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.989" end="00:11:07.019" style="s2">places in the world I mean they probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.459" end="00:11:08.609" style="s2">do in stuff but yeah I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.019" end="00:11:10.379" style="s2">that he but I it&#39;s not a widespread</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.609" end="00:11:11.489" style="s2">thing certainly not in the UK we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.379" end="00:11:14.189" style="s2">have prisons</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.489" end="00:11:16.150" style="s2">although that said that said young</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.189" end="00:11:18.010" style="s2">offenders institutions and detentions</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.150" end="00:11:20.680" style="s2">and things like that not not secure you</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.010" end="00:11:22.060" style="s2">know not not category one two or three</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.680" end="00:11:24.790" style="s2">prisons but anything below that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.060" end="00:11:28.090" style="s2">believe can be private public</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.790" end="00:11:30.460" style="s2">partnerships kind of thing so whenever</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.090" end="00:11:32.590" style="s2">you when you whenever you have an organ</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.460" end="00:11:34.390" style="s2">of government that&#39;s privatized it</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.590" end="00:11:37.780" style="s2">really gets this inertia to its where</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.390" end="00:11:39.310" style="s2">like it&#39;s now there&#39;s people who&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.780" end="00:11:40.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a big corporation whose</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.310" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">existence depends on this thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.780" end="00:11:47.380" style="s2">continuing to happen and in fact depends</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:49.750" style="s2">on this thing growing so like it just</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.380" end="00:11:51.910" style="s2">the more government privatizes its</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.750" end="00:11:53.560" style="s2">functions the more immobile it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.910" end="00:11:55.180" style="s2">and they&#39;re less flexible it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.560" end="00:11:57.070" style="s2">so that&#39;s something we need to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.180" end="00:11:58.680" style="s2">about like what is going to happen to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.070" end="00:12:01.060" style="s2">the private prison system are they gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.680" end="00:12:02.560" style="s2">it&#39;s so hard to bankrupt a large</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.060" end="00:12:04.540" style="s2">business like that they have so much</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:08.950" style="s2">power for lobbying and for everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.540" end="00:12:10.420" style="s2">like if we&#39;re not gonna if we if we do</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.950" end="00:12:11.950" style="s2">want to take them down that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.420" end="00:12:13.210" style="s2">difficult if we don&#39;t want to take them</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.950" end="00:12:14.940" style="s2">down then we need to figure out some</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.210" end="00:12:19.320" style="s2">other way that some other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.940" end="00:12:19.320" style="s2">business that they can convert into I</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.210" end="00:12:27.700" style="s2">personally fully okay with them going</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.230" end="00:12:29.650" style="s2">bankrupt I know like the oil and gas</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.700" end="00:12:31.300" style="s2">industry I&#39;m not unlike those are people</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.650" end="00:12:33.100" style="s2">who don&#39;t mean my country right who</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.300" end="00:12:34.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have an education they make</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.100" end="00:12:35.830" style="s2">hundreds of thousands or a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.270" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">thousand dollars a year there is nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.830" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">else for them to transition into and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:41.350" style="s2">feel really badly for them I feel zero</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:46.660" style="s2">like oh no the shareholders are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.350" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">prisoner funny like Naaman and I realize</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.660" end="00:12:50.950" style="s2">that but like no shareholder ever should</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:52.180" style="s2">make a penny off of somebody else being</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.950" end="00:12:54.120" style="s2">in prison there should be no</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.180" end="00:12:57.370" style="s2">shareholders that&#39;s a ridiculous system</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.120" end="00:12:58.510" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not saying that I would don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.370" end="00:13:03.370" style="s2">want them to go bankrupt</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.510" end="00:13:05.710" style="s2">of course they do but even even without</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.370" end="00:13:07.960" style="s2">even without private prisons there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.710" end="00:13:09.520" style="s2">still incentive in the system to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.960" end="00:13:11.770" style="s2">incarcerate people right because you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.520" end="00:13:13.090" style="s2">have the whole time taking the UK as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.770" end="00:13:15.250" style="s2">example right you have the home office</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.090" end="00:13:16.600" style="s2">which gets however many hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.250" end="00:13:18.400" style="s2">millions of pounds a year it gets from</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.600" end="00:13:20.890" style="s2">the from the chart from the Treasury in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.400" end="00:13:22.570" style="s2">order to finance it&#39;s under there now if</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.890" end="00:13:24.100" style="s2">it starts so reduce the prison</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.570" end="00:13:25.450" style="s2">population well now is going to get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.100" end="00:13:26.950" style="s2">smaller budget right in the civil</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.450" end="00:13:27.670" style="s2">servants in the minister won&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.950" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">you know they</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.670" end="00:13:32.470" style="s2">they want a bigger budget every year</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">they growing so you know even even when</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.470" end="00:13:37.240" style="s2">there is not profit to be made from its</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:39.790" style="s2">incentives exist to expand the prison</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.240" end="00:13:41.470" style="s2">service incarcerate more people so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.790" end="00:13:43.300" style="s2">the Minister can say look we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.470" end="00:13:50.230" style="s2">tough on crime all that kind of bollocks</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.300" end="00:13:51.850" style="s2">you know what I mean it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.230" end="00:13:53.620" style="s2">the difference between the education</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.850" end="00:13:55.060" style="s2">system but it comes with a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.620" end="00:13:59.050" style="s2">things but like a teacher a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.060" end="00:14:00.580" style="s2">superintendent doesn&#39;t go around talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.050" end="00:14:02.050" style="s2">about birth control or not birth control</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.580" end="00:14:04.090" style="s2">right like they don&#39;t increase their</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.050" end="00:14:05.380" style="s2">it&#39;s just however much the population</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.090" end="00:14:07.180" style="s2">had a baby that&#39;s what they kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.380" end="00:14:08.260" style="s2">to deal with when they turn five that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.180" end="00:14:09.880" style="s2">what any people are in the education</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.260" end="00:14:11.620" style="s2">system and yet of course they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.880" end="00:14:14.020" style="s2">problems of classroom sizes and all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.620" end="00:14:16.420" style="s2">other stuff that comes with budgets but</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.020" end="00:14:17.380" style="s2">if we did judge jails based on what</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.420" end="00:14:18.070" style="s2">they&#39;re actually there to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.380" end="00:14:21.520" style="s2">theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.070" end="00:14:23.320" style="s2">right which is through this ism I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.520" end="00:14:25.570" style="s2">say the word how many criminals recommit</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.320" end="00:14:27.220" style="s2">crimes when they get out and that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.570" end="00:14:28.120" style="s2">what you actually got your budget on you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.220" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">know what I mean like if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.120" end="00:14:34.410" style="s2">shareholder you get it you get a bonus</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:34.410" style="s2">based on how hard are you doing your job</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.250" end="00:14:43.450" style="s2">sense of structure where you incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.930" end="00:14:47.140" style="s2">a low recidivism rate right you had a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.450" end="00:14:50.050" style="s2">clear problem if you manager a low</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.140" end="00:14:52.540" style="s2">recidivism rate then the prisons are not</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.050" end="00:14:54.550" style="s2">going to want people to be incarcerated</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.540" end="00:14:56.950" style="s2">again once they get out even if they</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.550" end="00:15:00.190" style="s2">commit crimes well but they could but</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.950" end="00:15:01.780" style="s2">the hopefully the prison system is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.190" end="00:15:03.100" style="s2">separate entity from the criminal</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.780" end="00:15:04.510" style="s2">justice system which actually puts</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.100" end="00:15:05.950" style="s2">people in the prisons in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.510" end="00:15:07.960" style="s2">right and so the prison actually has</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.950" end="00:15:11.110" style="s2">nothing to do with who gets sent back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.960" end="00:15:13.090" style="s2">prison or not but if they do get sent</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.110" end="00:15:14.470" style="s2">back to a prison any prison there and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.090" end="00:15:16.060" style="s2">tracks back to the first prison they</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.470" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">were in right are this person has</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.060" end="00:15:21.130" style="s2">recommitted a time therefore you get a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:22.780" style="s2">cut in your future payment or a penalty</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.130" end="00:15:26.470" style="s2">or you don&#39;t get your bonus or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.780" end="00:15:28.090" style="s2">it might be and if you&#39;re I&#39;m absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.470" end="00:15:31.180" style="s2">certain there would be incentives that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.090" end="00:15:33.250" style="s2">would break it that&#39;s because there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.180" end="00:15:36.550" style="s2">there are ways but I do like that I do</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.250" end="00:15:38.530" style="s2">like that oh is that someone graduates</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.550" end="00:15:40.100" style="s2">from your prison system and then ends up</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.530" end="00:15:42.590" style="s2">back up in the prison system</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.100" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">on you and what what percentage does</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.590" end="00:15:46.580" style="s2">this prism have a recidivism versus this</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.540" end="00:15:49.550" style="s2">one versus this one and looking at those</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.580" end="00:15:50.960" style="s2">type of information but the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.550" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">just do we have butts in the seat</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.960" end="00:15:54.830" style="s2">because we get X amount per prisoner and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:57.770" style="s2">yeah you want it and then judges are on</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.830" end="00:16:00.110" style="s2">the board and like shareholders of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.770" end="00:16:01.460" style="s2">things and so the more prisoners they</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.110" end="00:16:04.910" style="s2">send to those prisons the more money</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.460" end="00:16:08.120" style="s2">they get that is just a clear corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.910" end="00:16:09.980" style="s2">violation and I just started to realize</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.120" end="00:16:11.960" style="s2">it sorry which means you are they</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.980" end="00:16:17.060" style="s2">incentivized to maintain ten conditions</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.960" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">in the prison which encouraged people to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.060" end="00:16:19.670" style="s2">commit more crimes when they get out the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:21.830" style="s2">other side you don&#39;t make them incapable</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.670" end="00:16:23.480" style="s2">of living any kind of life other than a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.830" end="00:16:25.370" style="s2">life of crime when they get out so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.480" end="00:16:26.900" style="s2">they recommit offenses so they come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.370" end="00:16:30.860" style="s2">to jail so that you get future profits</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.900" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">you know I mean there&#39;s two things which</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.860" end="00:16:39.080" style="s2">occur to me which I think lead us nicely</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:42.260" style="s2">into the next section if I may so first</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.080" end="00:16:44.600" style="s2">thing is if prisons were not based</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.260" end="00:16:47.380" style="s2">primarily around taking your freedom</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.600" end="00:16:49.430" style="s2">away but were based primarily around</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.380" end="00:16:51.290" style="s2">retraining you so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.430" end="00:16:53.330" style="s2">retraining you and and dealing with your</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.290" end="00:16:56.120" style="s2">shifts so such that you might be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.330" end="00:16:58.070" style="s2">constructive member of the society how</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.120" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">about if you weren&#39;t locked up right so</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.070" end="00:17:01.730" style="s2">you turn up in the morning you go home</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:03.170" style="s2">in the evening fails to do that then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.730" end="00:17:04.490" style="s2">can&#39;t then you get locked up right there</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.170" end="00:17:06.290" style="s2">you get arrest and you get locked up but</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.490" end="00:17:07.990" style="s2">give prisoners the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.290" end="00:17:10.520" style="s2">actually turn up and do a day of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.990" end="00:17:12.260" style="s2">whatever the training is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.520" end="00:17:14.329" style="s2">assuming it&#39;s meaningful and my second</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.260" end="00:17:18.050" style="s2">point and this this is the big one</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.329" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">really is to reclassify not just in name</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.050" end="00:17:22.329" style="s2">but in the way that we think about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:24.800" style="s2">and the way that we interact with it we</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.329" end="00:17:27.620" style="s2">designate the criminal justice system as</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.800" end="00:17:29.900" style="s2">the conflict resolution or this conflict</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.620" end="00:17:31.160" style="s2">little dispute resolution service or</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.900" end="00:17:33.470" style="s2">something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.160" end="00:17:35.300" style="s2">in recognition of the fact that even</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.470" end="00:17:36.710" style="s2">good people actually in good faith come</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.300" end="00:17:39.260" style="s2">into conflict from time to time right</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.710" end="00:17:41.990" style="s2">and and you know having mechanisms in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.260" end="00:17:44.180" style="s2">the in the society at every level to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.990" end="00:17:46.220" style="s2">deal with this right you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.180" end="00:17:48.980" style="s2">within the family unit and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.220" end="00:17:50.270" style="s2">training exists at school and outside of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.980" end="00:17:52.940" style="s2">school and there&#39;s Public Information</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.610" end="00:19:28.720" style="s2">um this is a weird one for me because</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.050" end="00:19:30.790" style="s2">this this area of society it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.720" end="00:19:33.790" style="s2">exist in my vision of the future like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.790" end="00:19:35.560" style="s2">that we have a place we put people we</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.790" end="00:19:37.990" style="s2">don&#39;t want to deal with I do think</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.560" end="00:19:39.250" style="s2">there&#39;s probably a very tiny subsection</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.990" end="00:19:40.840" style="s2">of our population that no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.250" end="00:19:43.210" style="s2">great their nutrition and parenting and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.840" end="00:19:44.680" style="s2">everything as might be people who we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.210" end="00:19:47.740" style="s2">still murderers so rapists still need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.680" end="00:19:48.670" style="s2">be not in society those will be way less</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.740" end="00:19:50.170" style="s2">than what they are now and they still</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.670" end="00:19:51.610" style="s2">need to have dignity they still might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.170" end="00:19:53.230" style="s2">innocent they still might be like they</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.610" end="00:19:55.560" style="s2">still have to have a quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.230" end="00:19:59.380" style="s2">that they would want to participate in I</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.560" end="00:20:01.150" style="s2">think having if there are prisons having</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.380" end="00:20:04.030" style="s2">them run by the prisoners without it</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.150" end="00:20:06.100" style="s2">being Anarchy having them look at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.030" end="00:20:08.770" style="s2">budget what do we want to eat right like</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.100" end="00:20:11.080" style="s2">if we have three dollars per mouth to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.770" end="00:20:12.850" style="s2">feed per meal how much can we garden and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.080" end="00:20:14.770" style="s2">do things that add to that right how can</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.850" end="00:20:17.080" style="s2">we make sure everyone has has that have</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.770" end="00:20:18.490" style="s2">them actually work together deal with</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.080" end="00:20:22.890" style="s2">conflict to deal with how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.490" end="00:20:25.870" style="s2">these decisions made and looking I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.890" end="00:20:27.550" style="s2">looking at when you&#39;re in a prison</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.870" end="00:20:29.260" style="s2">system that you basically need to join a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.550" end="00:20:32.680" style="s2">gang and like looking at like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.260" end="00:20:34.810" style="s2">what is the how can we bring in actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.680" end="00:20:36.700" style="s2">conflict resolution and governance that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.810" end="00:20:37.810" style="s2">they want to be part of and have it be</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.700" end="00:20:40.180" style="s2">it is something that they can keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.810" end="00:20:42.130" style="s2">reiterating have it be iterative so it</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.180" end="00:20:44.170" style="s2">can it can grow and they can they can</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.130" end="00:20:46.540" style="s2">learn from it because then our prison</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.170" end="00:20:48.220" style="s2">coming out of the prison system they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.540" end="00:20:50.740" style="s2">be better than the rest of us you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.220" end="00:20:52.300" style="s2">like how often do I get the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.740" end="00:20:53.590" style="s2">participation of how I&#39;ve liked coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.300" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">together with a group of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.590" end="00:20:56.650" style="s2">society when are we gonna eat how are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.990" style="s2">going to bring that cost down how are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.650" end="00:21:00.160" style="s2">going to to do that how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.990" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">one of the other things that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.160" end="00:21:03.370" style="s2">belongs in the last section when Eric</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:05.890" style="s2">was talking was that a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.370" end="00:21:07.770" style="s2">criminal justice system is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.890" end="00:21:09.990" style="s2">human nature</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.770" end="00:21:11.490" style="s2">in its natural state like that when</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.990" end="00:21:14.580" style="s2">we&#39;re under stress we go through fight</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.490" end="00:21:17.730" style="s2">flight or freeze flight is hit and run</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.580" end="00:21:19.110" style="s2">right fight is like any kind of violence</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.730" end="00:21:20.250" style="s2">that comes out of it and it&#39;s like is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.110" end="00:21:22.710" style="s2">that right do I want to just give</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.250" end="00:21:24.210" style="s2">everyone a pass no but I do want to own</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.710" end="00:21:25.710" style="s2">that that&#39;s your nervous system if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.210" end="00:21:27.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have any option but to fight we</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.710" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">need to give you another option we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.270" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">to give you other avenues so that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:33.179" style="s2">moment&#39;s a decision grows and you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:35.460" style="s2">other things to do I know mine is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.179" end="00:21:37.649" style="s2">freebies and shut down I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.460" end="00:21:40.500" style="s2">choice in that luckily it&#39;s not illegal</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.649" end="00:21:41.909" style="s2">like luckily it&#39;s not illegal to shut</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.500" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">down so it&#39;s like if I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.909" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">respond I&#39;m not going to jail for it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:47.850" style="s2">probably unless I&#39;m with a cop they</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">really need me to respond in the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.850" end="00:21:54.539" style="s2">they want but I have other privileges</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:56.220" style="s2">safe from that so yes my version of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.539" end="00:21:58.890" style="s2">beautiful future is there are no prisons</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.220" end="00:22:01.020" style="s2">and we deal with the in and the out in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.890" end="00:22:02.429" style="s2">much more beautiful way that there we</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.020" end="00:22:04.110" style="s2">don&#39;t have police officers we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.429" end="00:22:06.809" style="s2">conflict resolution officers depending</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.110" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">on what the crisis is how do we respond</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.809" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">to it and what does that look like and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:11.669" style="s2">think it is something we do from that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:16.260" style="s2">from the ground up and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.669" end="00:22:20.039" style="s2">exactly what that looks like but I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.260" end="00:22:22.950" style="s2">we have I think a decent starting point</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.039" end="00:22:25.409" style="s2">actually is is already in existence I</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.950" end="00:22:27.330" style="s2">mean the notion of common law if it here</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.409" end="00:22:29.490" style="s2">- right I mean I I know it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.330" end="00:22:31.230" style="s2">captured in many ways by politics and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.490" end="00:22:35.340" style="s2">money I get that but but the notion</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.230" end="00:22:37.110" style="s2">itself of you know trial in a place</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.340" end="00:22:39.090" style="s2">where all arguments are heard and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.110" end="00:22:41.580" style="s2">decision is made by a jury of your peers</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.090" end="00:22:45.929" style="s2">right and a punishment is decided on by</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.580" end="00:22:47.640" style="s2">a experienced judge member of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.929" end="00:22:49.620" style="s2">community whatever you know is that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.640" end="00:22:51.240" style="s2">model something along those lines seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.620" end="00:22:53.159" style="s2">to me to be very fair because you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.240" end="00:22:54.659" style="s2">you then have a record of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.159" end="00:22:56.789" style="s2">thing that has gone before so what does</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.659" end="00:22:58.350" style="s2">the size society deem in general to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.789" end="00:23:00.330" style="s2">an appropriate punishment or an</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.350" end="00:23:01.980" style="s2">appropriate form of retribution or</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.330" end="00:23:05.279" style="s2">penance or whatever for this for this</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.980" end="00:23:07.289" style="s2">particular transgression but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.279" end="00:23:09.210" style="s2">updatable right as time goes on and the</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.580" end="00:23:19.169" style="s2">right and and and sentencing also should</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.399" end="00:23:20.549" style="s2">you know can involve and involve the</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.580" end="00:23:35.280" style="s2">is a regular feature of daily life right</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.429" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">that it is a privilege to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:38.790" style="s2">process of keeping a society running</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:41.630" style="s2">smoothly and healthy and keeping</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.790" end="00:23:45.000" style="s2">relations constructive between people by</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.630" end="00:23:47.010" style="s2">participating in the fair process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.000" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">conflict resolution right and by</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.010" end="00:23:51.660" style="s2">participating in it you will understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:53.730" style="s2">yourself when you arrive in conflict you</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.660" end="00:23:55.559" style="s2">know how am I I better deal with this so</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.730" end="00:23:59.820" style="s2">that I turned up in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.559" end="00:24:01.429" style="s2">jury so we could spend less time in jury</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.820" end="00:24:03.900" style="s2">that would actually a really good metric</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.429" end="00:24:08.940" style="s2">I want to give Josh one Shilo a chance</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.900" end="00:24:12.600" style="s2">to share their vision of a future so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.940" end="00:24:14.340" style="s2">yeah I really liked the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.600" end="00:24:15.960" style="s2">prioritizing conflict resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.340" end="00:24:18.870" style="s2">restorative justice over a punitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.960" end="00:24:20.070" style="s2">justice Stoller&#39;s justice thank you</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.870" end="00:24:23.549" style="s2">that&#39;s the term that was looking cool</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.070" end="00:24:27.179" style="s2">thank you yeah if if there is a if</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.549" end="00:24:30.210" style="s2">there&#39;s someone who&#39;s just so some so</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.179" end="00:24:32.220" style="s2">like dysfunctional and that they that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.210" end="00:24:33.990" style="s2">their community can&#39;t handle them then</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.220" end="00:24:37.290" style="s2">maybe some kind of state institution</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.990" end="00:24:38.700" style="s2">would be a good idea now I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.290" end="00:24:40.200" style="s2">that the right thing for that state</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.700" end="00:24:41.669" style="s2">institution to do would be to punish</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.200" end="00:24:46.620" style="s2">this person I think it would be to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.669" end="00:24:48.630" style="s2">rehabilitate them and right now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.620" end="00:24:51.480" style="s2">have the therapeutic technologies to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.630" end="00:24:53.130" style="s2">rehabilitate everybody who&#39;s capable of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.480" end="00:24:56.309" style="s2">ribbing rehabilitated we can basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.130" end="00:24:59.610" style="s2">only do the easiest cases but if we um</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.309" end="00:25:03.780" style="s2">if we just like get much better at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.610" end="00:25:05.820" style="s2">make better technologies etc we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.780" end="00:25:08.820" style="s2">able to rehabilitate a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.820" end="00:25:10.980" style="s2">amount of people and the better we get</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.820" end="00:25:12.840" style="s2">the more people we can rehabilitate like</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.980" end="00:25:15.059" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like a rehabilitated</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.840" end="00:25:16.650" style="s2">tubule or not I think it&#39;s about how</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.059" end="00:25:18.990" style="s2">difficult it is to rehabilitate this</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.650" end="00:25:20.429" style="s2">person and how much time and energy it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.990" end="00:25:22.440" style="s2">will take like maybe there&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.429" end="00:25:26.040" style="s2">who&#39;s so difficult to rehabilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.440" end="00:25:27.929" style="s2">you need a team of 20 um 20</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.040" end="00:25:30.450" style="s2">psychologists working all the time to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.929" end="00:25:32.250" style="s2">figure out how to do it but even even if</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.450" end="00:25:34.770" style="s2">that was necessary for some people I</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.250" end="00:25:37.620" style="s2">think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.770" end="00:25:39.390" style="s2">it should be done unless the society</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.620" end="00:25:42.419" style="s2">just does not have the resources to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.390" end="00:25:43.950" style="s2">it so that&#39;s the other case what if the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.419" end="00:25:47.840" style="s2">society just simply doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.950" end="00:25:50.850" style="s2">resources to rehabilitate some people</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.840" end="00:25:53.789" style="s2">and they also can&#39;t be led out into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.850" end="00:25:57.650" style="s2">general Society for those people if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.789" end="00:26:02.520" style="s2">really can&#39;t rehabilitate them and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.650" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">Australia that&#39;s the case there no no no</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.520" end="00:26:05.250" style="s2">I was just saying that&#39;s what Australia</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:06.570" style="s2">was for that&#39;s exactly what we used to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.250" end="00:26:11.159" style="s2">do was dump all of those people in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.570" end="00:26:13.559" style="s2">Australia I think I would actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.159" end="00:26:15.899" style="s2">very cautious about this because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.559" end="00:26:17.669" style="s2">I don&#39;t wouldn&#39;t trust the the US for</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.899" end="00:26:19.500" style="s2">example I don&#39;t I&#39;m against the death</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.669" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">penalty in the US just simply because I</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.500" end="00:26:23.370" style="s2">don&#39;t trust the government to administer</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:25.860" style="s2">it properly are there&#39;s too many</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.370" end="00:26:28.020" style="s2">innocent people who get in trouble etc</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.860" end="00:26:29.309" style="s2">but if I actually trusted the government</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.020" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">then I would think that the death</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.309" end="00:26:33.240" style="s2">penalty is a good idea for people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:36.029" style="s2">can&#39;t be who the society does not have</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.240" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">the means to rehabilitate and also you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.029" end="00:26:39.809" style="s2">don&#39;t want in the general sphere because</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:42.090" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re just keeping them</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.809" end="00:26:44.309" style="s2">around and you you don&#39;t have the means</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.090" end="00:26:47.270" style="s2">to help him and you can&#39;t let them out</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.309" end="00:26:47.270" style="s2">so what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.149" end="00:27:01.529" style="s2">a secure island somewhere would be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.850" end="00:27:03.029" style="s2">maybe but yeah maybe if you collect</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.529" end="00:27:04.350" style="s2">Rissa tea and internet and TV and blah</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.029" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">blah blah blah blah yeah they could</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.350" end="00:27:08.039" style="s2">still as Jubilee said before have some</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:09.659" style="s2">sort of quality of life some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.039" end="00:27:11.850" style="s2">dignity some sort of self-determination</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.659" end="00:27:13.230" style="s2">but they&#39;re not a threat to anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.850" end="00:27:14.970" style="s2">right there in the middle of the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.230" end="00:27:18.270" style="s2">thousands of miles away from anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.970" end="00:27:21.149" style="s2">can&#39;t do any harm right okay yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.270" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">work says hey we don&#39;t need to agree on</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.149" end="00:27:24.570" style="s2">it because I don&#39;t agree on on the death</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:26.340" style="s2">penalty but I love how even though that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.570" end="00:27:29.190" style="s2">little piece yeah that could work I love</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.340" end="00:27:33.409" style="s2">it um Shilo do you have anything you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.190" end="00:27:36.990" style="s2">would like to add to the session yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.409" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">like like you Jubilee I feel like there</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.990" end="00:27:43.159" style="s2">is we need to there&#39;s systemic change</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:46.020" style="s2">that has to happen because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.159" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">driven by money one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.020" end="00:27:50.280" style="s2">either we have enough finances or</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:52.580" style="s2">to make money off people that is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.280" end="00:27:55.080" style="s2">only measurement that we measure our</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.580" end="00:27:58.650" style="s2">countries our communities with is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.080" end="00:28:00.750" style="s2">they are financially wealthy or not</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.650" end="00:28:03.480" style="s2">that&#39;s like our one measurement so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.750" end="00:28:06.650" style="s2">really believe we need a universal</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.480" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">humanitarian well system that actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.650" end="00:28:10.800" style="s2">gives people value on all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.940" end="00:28:14.030" style="s2">different levels including our</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.800" end="00:28:16.860" style="s2">communities and I really believe that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.030" end="00:28:20.220" style="s2">beginning the process in your community</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.860" end="00:28:24.900" style="s2">where you okay this is a very personal</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.220" end="00:28:27.720" style="s2">thing for me I it&#39;s really hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.900" end="00:28:34.200" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna say it I committed a crime</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.720" end="00:28:35.820" style="s2">when I was young teenager and it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.200" end="00:28:39.750" style="s2">kind of like I was saying earlier like</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.820" end="00:28:42.270" style="s2">you get judged for so long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.750" end="00:28:44.910" style="s2">growing up through your community your</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.270" end="00:28:47.970" style="s2">school and I felt like I really needed</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.910" end="00:28:50.580" style="s2">to like make my presence known in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.970" end="00:28:53.490" style="s2">bad group because I wasn&#39;t fitting into</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.580" end="00:28:55.770" style="s2">the good group let&#39;s say and so I went</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.490" end="00:28:57.120" style="s2">and decided to steal some alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.770" end="00:28:58.620" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s cool to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.120" end="00:29:03.720" style="s2">alcohol with your friends when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.620" end="00:29:05.340" style="s2">teenager so I went to like well I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.720" end="00:29:06.840" style="s2">homeless so I stayed with people but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.340" end="00:29:09.420" style="s2">went to their neighbor&#39;s house and stole</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.840" end="00:29:11.670" style="s2">some booze with some friends and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.420" end="00:29:15.420" style="s2">stashed it and then the next day we went</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.670" end="00:29:17.310" style="s2">to get it and the cops caught us and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.420" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">know they played good kept bad cop there</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.310" end="00:29:22.050" style="s2">at each of us they&#39;re like they said it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:23.700" style="s2">was you they said it was you so we all</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.050" end="00:29:27.090" style="s2">admitted that yeah we sold it from this</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.700" end="00:29:30.210" style="s2">house well I ended up getting a felony</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.090" end="00:29:32.760" style="s2">conviction for that stealing alcohol as</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.210" end="00:29:36.120" style="s2">a teenager before I could even drive so</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.760" end="00:29:38.550" style="s2">I had a felony on my record mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.120" end="00:29:43.500" style="s2">I&#39;m white I&#39;m you know white middle</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.550" end="00:29:45.390" style="s2">class let&#39;s say I tried to ignore the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.500" end="00:29:46.530" style="s2">fact that I yes I went through juvie</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.390" end="00:29:47.910" style="s2">all this I didn&#39;t really try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.530" end="00:29:49.650" style="s2">acknowledge the fact I couldn&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.910" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t really understand the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.650" end="00:29:54.210" style="s2">power of a vote at the time when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:30:00.999" style="s2">teenager so what&#39;s my point here my</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.210" end="00:30:04.779" style="s2">point is I feel like I was able to just</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.999" end="00:30:06.609" style="s2">hide that from society and from myself I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.779" end="00:30:08.679" style="s2">never processed it I felt like a really</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.609" end="00:30:10.569" style="s2">bad person I knew the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.679" end="00:30:15.129" style="s2">stole from I felt really guilty but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.569" end="00:30:17.589" style="s2">never had to confront them like there</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.129" end="00:30:19.479" style="s2">was a woman a grandmother in the house I</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.109" end="00:30:35.529" style="s2">terrified and I feel like a better</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.609" end="00:30:39.249" style="s2">solution would have been me having to</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.249" end="00:30:42.429" style="s2">thing I did not mean to terrify you I</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.429" end="00:30:50.639" style="s2">idiots at school and I was so wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.469" end="00:30:53.609" style="s2">if I could have met her face to face</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.639" end="00:30:56.739" style="s2">done work for her right you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.609" end="00:30:59.619" style="s2">provided some sort of support for her</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.739" end="00:31:01.029" style="s2">she was needy she was an elderly woman</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.619" end="00:31:05.349" style="s2">stuck in a home I could have done</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.029" end="00:31:07.359" style="s2">something to help her and make a real</p>

<p begin="00:31:12.489" end="00:31:16.989" style="s2">chance to give you and you a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.319" end="00:31:19.689" style="s2">be forgiven and you know the slates have</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.989" end="00:31:21.879" style="s2">been wiped clean I actually wipe the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.689" end="00:31:23.259" style="s2">slate clean you know whereas you are</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.879" end="00:31:24.759" style="s2">obviously still suffering from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.259" end="00:31:26.619" style="s2">memory of it right you felt shame your</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.759" end="00:31:28.329" style="s2">whole life as a well you know you that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.619" end="00:31:30.549" style="s2">that burden could have been lifted from</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.329" end="00:31:33.069" style="s2">you I mean I don&#39;t you most likely she</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.549" end="00:31:34.989" style="s2">probably remember it right most likely</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.069" end="00:31:36.339" style="s2">but you know who knows maybe she&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.989" end="00:31:38.589" style="s2">you know she was terrified at the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.339" end="00:31:41.649" style="s2">maybe she is long term so who knows who</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.589" end="00:31:43.599" style="s2">knows but yeah it can all be gone it can</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.649" end="00:31:45.729" style="s2">all go away that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.599" end="00:31:47.799" style="s2">restorative justice is all about and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.729" end="00:31:49.959" style="s2">think you can start really young cuz we</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.799" end="00:31:51.849" style="s2">make mistakes I mean because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.959" end="00:31:53.379" style="s2">know yet when we&#39;re young we make</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.849" end="00:31:54.609" style="s2">mistakes because we don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.379" end="00:31:56.919" style="s2">result is that&#39;s why we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.609" end="00:31:59.919" style="s2">mistakes and you can start very young</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.919" end="00:32:02.259" style="s2">and help people make correct decisions</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.919" end="00:32:03.729" style="s2">and there&#39;s we don&#39;t need this prison</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.259" end="00:32:06.519" style="s2">system and and maybe like you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.729" end="00:32:09.069" style="s2">saying there is a smaller system but</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.519" end="00:32:12.609" style="s2">maybe we can still participate as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.069" end="00:32:14.500" style="s2">community and volunteer to be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.609" end="00:32:16.510" style="s2">this small system that needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.500" end="00:32:20.520" style="s2">to help rehabilitate people that seem to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.510" end="00:32:23.140" style="s2">be unrevealed we can&#39;t do that for and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.520" end="00:32:26.910" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.140" end="00:32:29.560" style="s2">wealth in our interconnectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.910" end="00:32:31.480" style="s2">helping one another I feel like that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.560" end="00:32:33.400" style="s2">a place that we could really grow and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.480" end="00:32:35.950" style="s2">build that I&#39;m sorry I probably didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.400" end="00:32:37.390" style="s2">need to go so personal but it does still</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.950" end="00:32:38.980" style="s2">affect me and I&#39;m sure that does all</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.390" end="00:32:40.600" style="s2">these people that are dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.980" end="00:32:42.490" style="s2">when I think it was a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.600" end="00:32:43.060" style="s2">story to sure to share Shiloh I think it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.490" end="00:32:45.070" style="s2">was perfect</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.060" end="00:32:48.340" style="s2">um I think we can have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.070" end="00:32:50.200" style="s2">conversation on time so we should have</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.340" end="00:32:52.210" style="s2">been arrested and weren&#39;t or you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.200" end="00:32:54.340" style="s2">any vice versa and that whole like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.210" end="00:32:55.870" style="s2">know my experiences are I&#39;m like I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.340" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">have been in prison several times if I</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.870" end="00:33:00.900" style="s2">didn&#39;t have my white sweet girl you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:03.490" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t do anything wrong privileged</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.900" end="00:33:04.930" style="s2">literate like constantly I&#39;m like you</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.490" end="00:33:06.280" style="s2">don&#39;t even know you should probably be</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.930" end="00:33:09.040" style="s2">following me around the grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.280" end="00:33:12.550" style="s2">and not that other person in my in my</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.040" end="00:33:16.780" style="s2">times of youth and that those are</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.550" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">important conversations like that I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.780" end="00:33:20.230" style="s2">a heart for people who have a criminal</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">drug to have a criminal record because I</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.230" end="00:33:23.500" style="s2">know I could have one but then other</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.970" end="00:33:25.030" style="s2">people who that happens to it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.500" end="00:33:27.190" style="s2">they somehow feel that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.030" end="00:33:28.840" style="s2">privilege gives them permission that no</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.190" end="00:33:29.740" style="s2">I did well I didn&#39;t get arrested for it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.840" end="00:33:31.930" style="s2">right so you must have been even worse</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.740" end="00:33:33.310" style="s2">you must have done even worse things if</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.930" end="00:33:36.010" style="s2">you not only did them but got arrested</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.310" end="00:33:37.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s like right no cuz the cops find</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.010" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">your smoking pot and you know bring it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.630" end="00:33:42.130" style="s2">home to your parents and still I do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:45.490" style="s2">steal and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s the one time</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.130" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">one time thing it&#39;s you transition into</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.490" end="00:33:51.790" style="s2">the next part which is the the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:55.470" style="s2">what we could actually do to improve our</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.790" end="00:33:57.940" style="s2">prison system with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.470" end="00:33:59.920" style="s2">$100,000 whether that is concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.940" end="00:34:03.460" style="s2">again on like Canada of the UK the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.920" end="00:34:06.280" style="s2">United States or globally depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.460" end="00:34:08.020" style="s2">10,000 and I did not have an idea for</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.280" end="00:34:11.260" style="s2">this but during the conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.020" end="00:34:13.510" style="s2">Shila just shared I actually have a idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.260" end="00:34:15.750" style="s2">but I want to see if anyone else has an</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.510" end="00:34:15.750" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.379" end="00:34:29.700" style="s2">I mean uncle account under the current</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.809" end="00:34:31.319" style="s2">system a victim is required right there</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.700" end="00:34:37.349" style="s2">needs to be someone who has been harmed</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.319" end="00:34:40.919" style="s2">in some way too so I mean it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.349" end="00:34:42.929" style="s2">that a community level one could figure</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.919" end="00:34:45.480" style="s2">out something along the lines of rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.929" end="00:34:50.519" style="s2">than going to the police and reporting</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.480" end="00:34:52.679" style="s2">this as a crime can we sit around a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.519" end="00:34:53.940" style="s2">table and hash it out between us and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.679" end="00:34:55.019" style="s2">know what I mean something like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.940" end="00:34:56.369" style="s2">so that that guy I mean that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.019" end="00:34:58.289" style="s2">require really any money it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.369" end="00:35:06.450" style="s2">requires effort it requires effort is</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.289" end="00:35:09.059" style="s2">what it requires and I think it requires</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.450" end="00:35:11.160" style="s2">a neutral space in your community to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.059" end="00:35:13.289" style="s2">able to do that which most communities</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.160" end="00:35:22.140" style="s2">in America really don&#39;t have that mutual</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.289" end="00:35:24.630" style="s2">space where people can come together one</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.140" end="00:35:27.630" style="s2">of the things I thought about when Shilo</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.630" end="00:35:29.670" style="s2">it was was sharing her story was what</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.630" end="00:35:31.650" style="s2">would be really powerful is getting I</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.670" end="00:35:33.690" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be 10,000 honestly a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.650" end="00:35:36.809" style="s2">hundred a thousand people together out</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.690" end="00:35:39.029" style="s2">of any there&#39;s a crime right you stole</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.809" end="00:35:41.250" style="s2">domestic violence whatever the crime is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.029" end="00:35:43.849" style="s2">getting people who&#39;ve committed that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.250" end="00:35:47.940" style="s2">crime who went to prison for that crime</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.849" end="00:35:50.519" style="s2">together to kompis solutions not for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.940" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">prison but for right like I was involved</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.519" end="00:35:53.430" style="s2">in domestic violence what would that</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:54.869" style="s2">have looked like where no one went to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.430" end="00:35:57.150" style="s2">prison right what would it look like to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.869" end="00:35:59.160" style="s2">deal with that in a family unit without</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.150" end="00:36:00.359" style="s2">ignoring it but actually doing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.160" end="00:36:01.740" style="s2">having the people who actually been in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.359" end="00:36:04.349" style="s2">that moment been in that fight flight or</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.740" end="00:36:06.150" style="s2">freeze and chosen fight right what does</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.349" end="00:36:07.619" style="s2">that look like to de-escalate what does</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.150" end="00:36:10.410" style="s2">it look like to give people a solution</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.619" end="00:36:11.940" style="s2">that isn&#39;t prison for that and same as</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.410" end="00:36:13.529" style="s2">stealing same with any of it right like</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.940" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">why are you stealing why are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.529" end="00:36:16.529" style="s2">that and then looking at what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:19.710" style="s2">something that could be in place to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.529" end="00:36:22.259" style="s2">bring that crime level down right have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.710" end="00:36:23.730" style="s2">have mediation have conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.259" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t go through the court system</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.730" end="00:36:28.319" style="s2">but has an option because the issues</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:31.170" style="s2">also you need both the victim and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.319" end="00:36:33.150" style="s2">perpetrator or whatever wording is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.170" end="00:36:34.829" style="s2">agree right and restorative</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.150" end="00:36:36.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like if one person wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.829" end="00:36:37.740" style="s2">regular dress and what a computed</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.420" end="00:36:40.589" style="s2">injustice and the other person wants</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.740" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">restorative who wins right and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.589" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">well maybe the victim I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">gets to choose right that was part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:49.859" style="s2">what I wanted to put in the last section</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:52.020" style="s2">but maybe this is um and I have ideas</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.859" end="00:36:54.089" style="s2">because when we say a jury of your peers</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.020" end="00:36:56.849" style="s2">you actually get to choose who those</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.089" end="00:36:58.589" style="s2">peers are so you know anything like I</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.849" end="00:37:00.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know who my peers would be but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.589" end="00:37:02.849" style="s2">would know if they&#39;re not on the jury</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.660" end="00:37:04.859" style="s2">right if I&#39;m a black man and the entire</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.849" end="00:37:06.900" style="s2">jury looks like white people well no I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.859" end="00:37:09.029" style="s2">actually wanted a jury of black people</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.900" end="00:37:11.460" style="s2">if I can voice that I should be given it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.029" end="00:37:13.410" style="s2">because of a if the jury of black people</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.460" end="00:37:16.079" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t find me guilty you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.410" end="00:37:17.849" style="s2">that that seems that is the jury of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.079" end="00:37:21.180" style="s2">peers and that&#39;s honestly what white</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.849" end="00:37:22.500" style="s2">people get anyway like that level of oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.180" end="00:37:23.849" style="s2">you look like my cousin and you look</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.500" end="00:37:26.309" style="s2">like my brother I&#39;ll give you a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.849" end="00:37:29.160" style="s2">more leeway and so to have a jury of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.309" end="00:37:31.710" style="s2">your actual peers is and then oh like</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.160" end="00:37:34.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like well I&#39;m a murderer I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.710" end="00:37:36.569" style="s2">do a bunch of murderers I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.410" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">far it goes but that eats just</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.569" end="00:37:41.270" style="s2">articulated and then to be in the court</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:50.579" style="s2">system what is and isn&#39;t considered</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.270" end="00:37:53.069" style="s2">acceptable a jury of your peers I really</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.579" end="00:37:55.859" style="s2">like that idea of the option to choose</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.069" end="00:37:58.789" style="s2">if you want to go restorative justice or</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.859" end="00:38:01.140" style="s2">punitive justice and and you as the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.789" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">person that committed the crime get to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.140" end="00:38:06.809" style="s2">kind of choose that and then following</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:08.670" style="s2">that with you know a metric system that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.809" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">follows them through their life to help</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.670" end="00:38:16.559" style="s2">them not recommit finding ways I feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:18.690" style="s2">like part of this humanitarian system I</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.559" end="00:38:20.910" style="s2">think of is our interconnectedness and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.690" end="00:38:23.309" style="s2">the ability for people that commit</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.910" end="00:38:26.250" style="s2">crimes to go into their community and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.309" end="00:38:29.279" style="s2">ask for help and ask like I&#39;m struggling</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.250" end="00:38:30.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t have a job you know whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.279" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">reason they&#39;re different things are and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.690" end="00:38:35.880" style="s2">find different maybe mentors in their</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">community to help them step up to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.880" end="00:38:40.799" style="s2">next level so that we&#39;re always we</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:42.900" style="s2">realize we&#39;re always learning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.799" end="00:38:44.970" style="s2">always improving and giving those people</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.900" end="00:38:45.930" style="s2">the opportunity to do that and with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.970" end="00:38:48.660" style="s2">hand like</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.930" end="00:38:53.660" style="s2">helping them it&#39;s so hard on your own to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.660" end="00:38:55.980" style="s2">figure out just morale he&#39;s clean</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.660" end="00:38:58.319" style="s2">especially when your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.980" end="00:39:00.780" style="s2">isn&#39;t fully developed which is right</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.319" end="00:39:02.910" style="s2">they crowed the adults you get to vote</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.780" end="00:39:06.059" style="s2">as a teen your prefrontal cortex is</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.910" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">until you&#39;re what 23 24 and so heaven</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.059" end="00:39:09.980" style="s2">for bit and then like 15 6 general</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:12.569" style="s2">commits a crime we try them as an adult</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.980" end="00:39:13.559" style="s2">that&#39;s not the right direction like</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.569" end="00:39:15.900" style="s2">that&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.559" end="00:39:18.569" style="s2">I know I did decisions at 15 or 16 I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.900" end="00:39:20.069" style="s2">a very smart 15 or 16 year old and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.569" end="00:39:22.980" style="s2">still did things that I&#39;m like what were</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.069" end="00:39:26.099" style="s2">you thinking and like you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.980" end="00:39:30.869" style="s2">about neurodiversity or mental illness I</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.099" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">mean we&#39;re holding people trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.869" end="00:39:38.040" style="s2">hell basically who just just never had</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:41.730" style="s2">an opportunity I totally I just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.040" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">believe what we do to people I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.730" end="00:39:47.309" style="s2">know how to change like if we have this</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:50.819" style="s2">$100,000 or whatever I mean it just</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.309" end="00:39:54.869" style="s2">seems like such a huge thing to change</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.819" end="00:39:56.819" style="s2">but we have to you just here&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.869" end="00:39:58.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like it feels like the only way we</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.819" end="00:40:01.890" style="s2">could possibly tackle prisons is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.650" end="00:40:04.589" style="s2">systemically and systemic change is hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.890" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">and difficult and so it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.589" end="00:40:07.109" style="s2">throw up your hands there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:09.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re having the solution</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.109" end="00:40:11.670" style="s2">raising is there&#39;s always something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.000" end="00:40:13.950" style="s2">can be done right now that it&#39;s absolute</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.670" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">like I have a ton of ideas sparking for</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.950" end="00:40:19.349" style="s2">this for this space like we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:21.180" style="s2">because judges are any time they make a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.349" end="00:40:23.670" style="s2">verdict any time they it&#39;s on public</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.180" end="00:40:25.650" style="s2">record well we could have a database of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.670" end="00:40:28.260" style="s2">that we could see what cops sent who to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.650" end="00:40:29.849" style="s2">prison what judges sent who to prison we</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.260" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">can see the blatant racism when it</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.849" end="00:40:33.510" style="s2">happens and because it&#39;s public we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:34.829" style="s2">need their permission that you know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.510" end="00:40:36.299" style="s2">I mean if we have enough other people</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.829" end="00:40:38.760" style="s2">when I have an interaction with a cop I</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.299" end="00:40:41.369" style="s2">just plug it right did they pull me over</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.760" end="00:40:41.880" style="s2">yes no didn&#39;t I get a ticket yes no was</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.369" end="00:40:44.250" style="s2">I speeding</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.880" end="00:40:46.349" style="s2">yes I don&#39;t know yes no right like what</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:49.829" style="s2">was actually there you need more people</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.349" end="00:40:50.819" style="s2">than like if we need more data so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.829" end="00:40:52.559" style="s2">more people are putting doubt in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.819" end="00:40:54.420" style="s2">system the better it is but to be able</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.559" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">to showcase those kind of things to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.420" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">able to there was a anytime anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:40:59.960" style="s2">wants to chime in to take off from you</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:03.510" style="s2">cuz I&#39;ll just run through</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.960" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">there was a what is it called The Good</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.510" end="00:41:09.560" style="s2">Wife and there&#39;s a spin-off called The</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:11.849" style="s2">Good Life or good law or something and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.560" end="00:41:13.320" style="s2">one of the people in it I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.849" end="00:41:15.089" style="s2">which which where there&#39;s a spin-off or</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.320" end="00:41:17.310" style="s2">not but he brought an app he was in</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.089" end="00:41:20.369" style="s2">prison he wrote an app that was helping</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.310" end="00:41:22.170" style="s2">prisoners navigate the legal system from</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.369" end="00:41:23.609" style="s2">within the prison so when when the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.170" end="00:41:25.349" style="s2">prison does something wrong to you and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.609" end="00:41:27.420" style="s2">you need to request tampons when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.349" end="00:41:28.950" style="s2">need to like this is the this is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.420" end="00:41:30.150" style="s2">process you go through and it helps you</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.950" end="00:41:32.220" style="s2">go through the process you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.150" end="00:41:34.440" style="s2">get outside counsel this app is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.220" end="00:41:36.420" style="s2">your outside counsel and the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.440" end="00:41:37.589" style="s2">bought it and put it on and because they</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.420" end="00:41:40.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t want their jobs we take it over</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.589" end="00:41:41.970" style="s2">so they bought it made it not exist and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.200" end="00:41:44.070" style="s2">what I understand something like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.970" end="00:41:46.170" style="s2">this is a fictional it&#39;s actually very</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.070" end="00:41:47.940" style="s2">powerful to be able to help to be able</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.170" end="00:41:49.320" style="s2">to bring prisoners together after they</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.940" end="00:41:51.089" style="s2">get out to start their own worker</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.320" end="00:41:54.869" style="s2">cooperatives so it doesn&#39;t matter if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.089" end="00:41:57.089" style="s2">have a criminal background that we know</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.869" end="00:41:58.770" style="s2">because no one asks an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.089" end="00:42:00.300" style="s2">right if you hire a plumber you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.770" end="00:42:04.079" style="s2">ask them for their criminal record check</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.060" end="00:42:18.060" style="s2">on that&#39;s like their whole mission but</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.500" end="00:42:19.560" style="s2">then you have to be accepted for that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.060" end="00:42:21.270" style="s2">group if there was always a way to start</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.560" end="00:42:22.470" style="s2">a worker cooperative what can you learn</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.089" end="00:42:58.950" style="s2">is like our problem and when we see it</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.609" end="00:42:59.940" style="s2">on mass scale and see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.950" end="00:43:01.410" style="s2">but they&#39;re not having heat they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.940" end="00:43:02.790" style="s2">letting let out drink Obed they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.410" end="00:43:04.589" style="s2">you know they&#39;re in their cells 24 3</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.790" end="00:43:06.180" style="s2">hours a day whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.589" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">that were able to just witness it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.180" end="00:43:10.770" style="s2">hopefully come up with things from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:13.490" style="s2">bottom up that hold the top down powers</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.770" end="00:43:13.490" style="s2">accountable</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.340" end="00:43:32.700" style="s2">everybody else&#39;s on me yeah okay I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.900" end="00:43:34.950" style="s2">have solutions but I did just two other</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.700" end="00:43:36.300" style="s2">things I want to bring up one is that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.950" end="00:43:39.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know about other countries but in</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.300" end="00:43:41.310" style="s2">the u.s. about half of the people in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.210" end="00:43:43.170" style="s2">jails are haven&#39;t even been tried yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.310" end="00:43:49.560" style="s2">they&#39;re awaiting trial and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.170" end="00:43:51.030" style="s2">afford bail yeah so just fixing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.560" end="00:43:53.370" style="s2">justice system won&#39;t fix the prison</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.030" end="00:43:54.950" style="s2">system there&#39;s different the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.370" end="00:43:57.360" style="s2">I want to point out is that another</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.950" end="00:43:58.830" style="s2">incentive for imprisoning people is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.360" end="00:44:01.050" style="s2">you get cheap labor you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.830" end="00:44:07.190" style="s2">pay prisoners minimum wage so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.050" end="00:44:09.960" style="s2">stuff is made by prisoners at tracking</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.190" end="00:44:11.970" style="s2">what the is made by prisoners like</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.960" end="00:44:13.320" style="s2">my lingeries me buy them or something</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.970" end="00:44:14.610" style="s2">right and how much did they get paid per</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.320" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">hour because there&#39;s learning a skill</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.610" end="00:44:19.470" style="s2">and then there&#39;s just slave labor and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:21.060" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty clear which ones which</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.470" end="00:44:24.150" style="s2">and so Italy don&#39;t II met their fire</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.060" end="00:44:25.620" style="s2">fighting for a dollar a day know if</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.150" end="00:44:26.700" style="s2">they&#39;re learning how to fire fight and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.620" end="00:44:28.620" style="s2">they can do it on the other end they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.700" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">volunteering to do they&#39;re volunteering</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.620" end="00:44:31.380" style="s2">to do that to feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:33.180" style="s2">contributing that&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.380" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">route than like oh you get it all or a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.180" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">day so you can you know buy things from</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:39.810" style="s2">the canteen um and just making sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">everyone in person has a buddy right not</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.810" end="00:44:44.130" style="s2">a like a pen pal someone who like okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:45.810" style="s2">well even if you don&#39;t have a witness on</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.130" end="00:44:47.670" style="s2">the outside I will be your witness check</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.810" end="00:44:49.440" style="s2">and you pass if there&#39;s people on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.670" end="00:44:50.850" style="s2">outside witnessing and prisoners sign up</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.440" end="00:44:52.200" style="s2">for that and you don&#39;t check in for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.850" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">week and we throw up the red alert</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.200" end="00:44:55.800" style="s2">they&#39;re in or Dineen like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:58.350" style="s2">there&#39;s ways we can we can have power</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.800" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">without remember what y&#39;all just said</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.350" end="00:45:05.970" style="s2">that I wanted to everyone just as body</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:08.010" style="s2">system that&#39;s a brilliant idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.970" end="00:45:09.210" style="s2">where every prisoner has somebody on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.010" end="00:45:10.890" style="s2">outside that they communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.210" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">regularly and if the person on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.890" end="00:45:13.950" style="s2">outside doesn&#39;t hear from them or ever</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:15.690" style="s2">they can raise an alarm of some kind wow</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.950" end="00:45:17.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a really really good idea and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.690" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">they confide in them and the letters</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.130" end="00:45:20.490" style="s2">don&#39;t get read by the prison something</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:22.110" style="s2">like that is a really good idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.490" end="00:45:24.540" style="s2">why it was there people in prison who</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.110" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">haven&#39;t been tried tracking that right</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.540" end="00:45:27.180" style="s2">how long is this person been in well</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:29.730" style="s2">look if you were white you could have</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.180" end="00:45:31.050" style="s2">the $10,000 bail having bail bonds that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.730" end="00:45:32.520" style="s2">aren&#39;t bail bonds right they were like</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.050" end="00:45:33.809" style="s2">look we can see we can see you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.520" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">upstanding member of society</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.809" end="00:45:37.500" style="s2">we will front you the money right like</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:39.540" style="s2">like this isn&#39;t the bail bonds having</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.500" end="00:45:41.010" style="s2">alternative solutions to this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.540" end="00:45:43.980" style="s2">ridiculous that you&#39;re sitting in prison</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.010" end="00:45:46.020" style="s2">and that you are then a you&#39;re earning</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.980" end="00:45:47.490" style="s2">money for the prison instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.020" end="00:45:50.369" style="s2">able to provide for your family when</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.490" end="00:45:52.140" style="s2">you&#39;re probably not even guilty and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.369" end="00:45:55.950" style="s2">poverty that&#39;s keeping you they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.140" end="00:45:57.300" style="s2">your crime and even if it was how do we</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.950" end="00:45:59.400" style="s2">you know do everything else we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.300" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">about that just owning that those things</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.400" end="00:46:03.450" style="s2">exist and then how do we track them</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:05.430" style="s2">who&#39;s in prison and how long have they</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.450" end="00:46:07.890" style="s2">been there this is not a speedy justice</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.430" end="00:46:09.900" style="s2">system even if they committed the crime</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.890" end="00:46:11.490" style="s2">how bad is it on the outside right if</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.900" end="00:46:13.530" style="s2">they were murdering raping yeah I kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.490" end="00:46:15.390" style="s2">of want them locked up right but like if</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.530" end="00:46:17.190" style="s2">they&#39;re they smoked a joint</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.390" end="00:46:18.930" style="s2">oh no heaven forbid they do that well</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.190" end="00:46:22.339" style="s2">they wait I wait trial right like what</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.930" end="00:46:25.500" style="s2">is the what is the level of I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.339" end="00:46:28.890" style="s2">because of course race honey classism</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.500" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">come into it can you before is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.890" end="00:46:32.250" style="s2">so many different solutions like and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:34.170" style="s2">seems like you need to do all of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.250" end="00:46:36.809" style="s2">they&#39;re all connected like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.170" end="00:46:39.270" style="s2">something to do with the $10,000 is set</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.809" end="00:46:41.670" style="s2">up a foundation that that that gives</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.270" end="00:46:50.490" style="s2">grants to people who are trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.670" end="00:46:54.809" style="s2">this prison system yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.490" end="00:46:58.140" style="s2">I also think that we could help the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.809" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">justice system reduce its caseload if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.140" end="00:47:03.210" style="s2">were doing community justice at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:05.250" style="s2">lowest end maybe that could help reduce</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.210" end="00:47:09.140" style="s2">the amount of people that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.250" end="00:47:13.380" style="s2">seen in courts therefore helping that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.140" end="00:47:15.180" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know I think I feel like if</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.380" end="00:47:17.190" style="s2">we can come together better as a society</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.180" end="00:47:19.740" style="s2">and support one another and spend it</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.190" end="00:47:21.180" style="s2">just competing with each other then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.740" end="00:47:24.030" style="s2">have this opportunity to really change</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.180" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">you realize that our value is connected</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.030" end="00:47:28.380" style="s2">with one another&#39;s value in our</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:32.270" style="s2">community and therefore trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.380" end="00:47:39.210" style="s2">people improve giving them opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.270" end="00:47:40.020" style="s2">yeah having a I&#39;m having a better</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.210" end="00:47:42.030" style="s2">alternative</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.020" end="00:47:45.320" style="s2">the system is definitely very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.030" end="00:47:48.450" style="s2">towards dismantling the prison system</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.320" end="00:47:51.660" style="s2">but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.450" end="00:47:52.950" style="s2">because let&#39;s say a community tries to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.660" end="00:47:55.080" style="s2">have a better alternative they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.950" end="00:47:57.360" style="s2">to do community justice but there&#39;s cops</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.080" end="00:48:01.860" style="s2">still patrolling still arresting people</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.360" end="00:48:03.240" style="s2">still incarcerating people and the cops</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.860" end="00:48:05.010" style="s2">don&#39;t give a about their their</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.240" end="00:48:08.550" style="s2">community justice the cops just want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.010" end="00:48:10.830" style="s2">fill their quotas or whatever you need</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.550" end="00:48:14.040" style="s2">to have a better alternative but you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.830" end="00:48:17.910" style="s2">also need to try to change that it on</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.040" end="00:48:20.730" style="s2">defund the police at like proportionally</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.910" end="00:48:24.060" style="s2">to making the better alternative that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.730" end="00:48:24.540" style="s2">your alternative oh that&#39;s replace the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.060" end="00:48:27.840" style="s2">police</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.540" end="00:48:32.610" style="s2">I completely agree and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.840" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">having a humanitarian well system we</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.610" end="00:48:37.350" style="s2">also I mean the police are actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.510" style="s2">using that as well and therefore there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.350" end="00:48:41.550" style="s2">a record of the interactions and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.510" end="00:48:44.340" style="s2">more accountable then because our our</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.550" end="00:48:47.880" style="s2">interactions with the police or more at</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.340" end="00:48:48.840" style="s2">a community equal face-to-face level so</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.880" end="00:48:50.850" style="s2">we&#39;re getting to know them better</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.840" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing our improvements we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.850" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">seeing where they&#39;re acting and act</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:59.130" style="s2">you&#39;re incorrectly their abuse I just</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:49:01.590" style="s2">feel like having our metrics on it would</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.130" end="00:49:03.600" style="s2">be help a different type of metrics like</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.590" end="00:49:08.010" style="s2">yeah not just the camera that they can</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.600" end="00:49:09.600" style="s2">turn on or off the origin of policing in</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.010" end="00:49:11.580" style="s2">the I mean again it&#39;s not like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.600" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">anymore but the origin of policing in UK</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.580" end="00:49:16.830" style="s2">it was by consent right you know people</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:18.570" style="s2">from the community volunteered to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.830" end="00:49:20.190" style="s2">know be of service to those that needed</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.570" end="00:49:24.210" style="s2">help kind of thing and it was and it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.190" end="00:49:26.850" style="s2">all all originated in and was done with</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.210" end="00:49:28.770" style="s2">the consent of the community and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.850" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">people and again this feels like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.770" end="00:49:33.480" style="s2">ancient notion but it seems to be one</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:39.960" style="s2">worth resurrecting and see if it can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.480" end="00:49:43.170" style="s2">invigorated I feel like this is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.960" end="00:49:44.520" style="s2">not the place when 10 minutes left but</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.170" end="00:49:47.550" style="s2">like what I&#39;m when I&#39;m struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.520" end="00:49:49.830" style="s2">leadership in the game be space and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.550" end="00:49:50.940" style="s2">the game be people aren&#39;t like policing</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.830" end="00:49:52.350" style="s2">themselves right like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.940" end="00:49:52.910" style="s2">moderating themselves they need someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.350" end="00:49:54.770" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.910" end="00:49:56.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s a truth to that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.770" end="00:49:58.490" style="s2">also like there&#39;s a truth to that in</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.570" end="00:50:00.020" style="s2">this conversation of like restorative</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.490" end="00:50:03.910" style="s2">justice is the community taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.020" end="00:50:07.160" style="s2">in a very beautiful way at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.910" end="00:50:08.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a community justice that is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.160" end="00:50:11.420" style="s2">like that which is you know like lynch</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.870" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">mobs and and that level of life right so</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.420" end="00:50:15.650" style="s2">so how do you make sure there is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:18.650" style="s2">where we&#39;re not just kicking people out</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.650" end="00:50:20.090" style="s2">to kick them out and we&#39;re not like how</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.650" end="00:50:22.490" style="s2">do we not leave it up to a central</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.090" end="00:50:23.780" style="s2">authority to do restored to do justice</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.490" end="00:50:25.670" style="s2">because when it&#39;s at a central authority</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.780" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really easy to put everything on</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.670" end="00:50:29.840" style="s2">them right you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:31.220" style="s2">arrested enough of the criminals and at</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.840" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">the same time you&#39;re arresting too many</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.220" end="00:50:34.280" style="s2">right because those are for two</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:35.570" style="s2">different people so it&#39;s like they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.280" end="00:50:37.430" style="s2">make everyone happy whereas together</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.570" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like what is the crime rate what</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.430" end="00:50:41.810" style="s2">crimes are actually crimes and can we</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:44.030" style="s2">bring those down why are people stealing</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.810" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">why are people in so much conflict that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.030" end="00:50:47.270" style="s2">they feel they need to commit violence</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:49.490" style="s2">how do we keep bringing that down and</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.270" end="00:50:51.080" style="s2">although you&#39;re right we need all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.490" end="00:50:53.750" style="s2">these things in place that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.080" end="00:50:56.120" style="s2">about any single one of them would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.750" end="00:50:57.530" style="s2">powerful and what&#39;s even more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.120" end="00:51:00.050" style="s2">is that ten thousand people know they</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.530" end="00:51:02.510" style="s2">can get together to create them they do</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.050" end="00:51:04.250" style="s2">create all of them not just one of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.510" end="00:51:06.410" style="s2">and so if we had a way to track the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.250" end="00:51:08.510" style="s2">judges and track the the police officers</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.410" end="00:51:10.220" style="s2">to know if they&#39;re being races and a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.510" end="00:51:12.050" style="s2">to buddy up with the prison&#39;s the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.220" end="00:51:13.610" style="s2">in prison to watch and witness and help</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.050" end="00:51:15.260" style="s2">them improve life while they&#39;re in there</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.610" end="00:51:16.850" style="s2">and a way to help them have jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.260" end="00:51:19.190" style="s2">vote and have a real decent life on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.850" end="00:51:21.350" style="s2">way out all of that can take place and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.190" end="00:51:22.610" style="s2">and I want to help that even though I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.350" end="00:51:23.780" style="s2">not involved in that criminal justice</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.610" end="00:51:25.220" style="s2">system right I mean I don&#39;t I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.780" end="00:51:27.140" style="s2">prisoner I&#39;ve never had any of my loved</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.220" end="00:51:29.750" style="s2">ones be a prisoner and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.140" end="00:51:31.340" style="s2">even without anyone&#39;s involvement from</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.750" end="00:51:33.290" style="s2">the outside they could do it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.340" end="00:51:35.390" style="s2">right just people who&#39;ve been through</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.290" end="00:51:38.750" style="s2">the prison system could create something</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.390" end="00:51:41.960" style="s2">to witness done better they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.750" end="00:51:44.810" style="s2">an outside force to do it and there&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.960" end="00:51:51.800" style="s2">I&#39;m going on I try the bug source</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.810" end="00:51:54.470" style="s2">raising it general that brings a couple</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.800" end="00:51:57.980" style="s2">things to my mind Jubilee I I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.470" end="00:52:01.430" style="s2">if you just got 10,000 people that were</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.980" end="00:52:03.110" style="s2">incarcerated to put their $10 each in</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.430" end="00:52:04.850" style="s2">and come up with this gun you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.110" end="00:52:06.710" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that have been</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.850" end="00:52:09.050" style="s2">supporting themselves to start</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.710" end="00:52:13.390" style="s2">foundation that thang could that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.050" end="00:52:17.480" style="s2">pretty powerful also I wanted to say I</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.390" end="00:52:20.300" style="s2">personally feel that money and the lack</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.480" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">of money is almost the bottom-line issue</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.300" end="00:52:24.320" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean it like everybody</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:29.750" style="s2">commits a crime because the money but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.320" end="00:52:33.619" style="s2">mean like pop communities that have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.750" end="00:52:35.240" style="s2">lot of poverty they have to if people</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.619" end="00:52:36.740" style="s2">are in work they have to be at work</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.240" end="00:52:38.780" style="s2">they&#39;re usually really low wage jobs</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.740" end="00:52:40.339" style="s2">they have to be at work maybe both the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.780" end="00:52:44.270" style="s2">parents if there&#39;s only one parent that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.339" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">parent has to be at work so in my mind I</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.270" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">feel like needing less money instead of</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:53.540" style="s2">more money is really key like if we</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:57.380" style="s2">could find a way to reduce the need for</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.540" end="00:52:59.240" style="s2">money to constantly be inflated and</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.380" end="00:53:03.170" style="s2">people always need more more to pay</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.240" end="00:53:05.119" style="s2">their rent or whatever it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.170" end="00:53:06.740" style="s2">like then where people can have an</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.119" end="00:53:08.270" style="s2">opportunity to participate in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.740" end="00:53:10.910" style="s2">community because what happens is they</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.270" end="00:53:12.320" style="s2">can&#39;t participate in train to help</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.910" end="00:53:14.330" style="s2">people in their community because</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.320" end="00:53:16.339" style="s2">they&#39;re strapped they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.330" end="00:53:18.560" style="s2">a moment to they&#39;re stressed out their</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.339" end="00:53:23.210" style="s2">kids are stressed out it&#39;s hard to be me</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.560" end="00:53:24.770" style="s2">or in a world that says money like five</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.210" end="00:53:26.300" style="s2">dollars it&#39;s nothing anymore twenty</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.770" end="00:53:27.770" style="s2">dollars is nothing in fifty bucks that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.300" end="00:53:31.550" style="s2">nothing a hundred dollars nothing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.770" end="00:53:34.730" style="s2">like oh my gosh anything sorry I know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.550" end="00:53:38.260" style="s2">have to the idea there being a pool of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.730" end="00:53:40.280" style="s2">money but the prisoners themselves have</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.260" end="00:53:42.920" style="s2">like they&#39;ve chosen to put it in there</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.280" end="00:53:44.660" style="s2">but also because there&#39;s the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.920" end="00:53:46.580" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to pay prisoners well</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.660" end="00:53:48.230" style="s2">while they&#39;re in prison because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.580" end="00:53:48.740" style="s2">a better employment in prison you go to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.230" end="00:53:50.270" style="s2">prison</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.740" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a ridiculous assumption but</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.270" end="00:53:53.330" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s an assumption that instead</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:55.339" style="s2">of saying well we have to pay these</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.330" end="00:53:56.060" style="s2">people only a dollar an hour to fight</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.339" end="00:53:57.560" style="s2">fires</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.060" end="00:53:58.849" style="s2">there could be a way to get the best</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.560" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">aware it&#39;s like they get to choose</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.849" end="00:54:03.140" style="s2">whether they&#39;re there and the money</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:04.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t saved by the prison and paint it</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.140" end="00:54:06.830" style="s2">you don&#39;t I mean like some horrific</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.310" end="00:54:08.720" style="s2">capitalist prison system but is instead</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.830" end="00:54:10.520" style="s2">paid to a funds that they can then</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:12.200" style="s2">decide when they get out are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.520" end="00:54:13.369" style="s2">loan it to chip the prisoners right are</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.200" end="00:54:15.080" style="s2">they gonna pay it back is it going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.369" end="00:54:16.730" style="s2">like a micro plan this is gonna be that</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.080" end="00:54:18.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like right you&#39;re paying it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.730" end="00:54:19.930" style="s2">not minimum wage but five ten dollars an</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.890" end="00:54:21.970" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.930" end="00:54:23.620" style="s2">and this is that would be again top-down</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.970" end="00:54:25.390" style="s2">be like convincing the prison system do</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.620" end="00:54:26.920" style="s2">that but if they came from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.390" end="00:54:28.690" style="s2">10,000 prisoners coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.920" end="00:54:30.040" style="s2">same we&#39;re putting on $10 in for</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.690" end="00:54:32.610" style="s2">deciding this they didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.040" end="00:54:35.590" style="s2">powerful force to lobby with and say</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.610" end="00:54:36.910" style="s2">right we have another solution it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.590" end="00:54:38.740" style="s2">paying them a dollar an hour and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.910" end="00:54:41.230" style="s2">not giving them the money directly that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.740" end="00:54:42.910" style="s2">is they get a tiny bit and the pool gets</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.230" end="00:54:44.200" style="s2">it and we have the month which has its</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.910" end="00:54:47.790" style="s2">own corruption and hierarchy everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.200" end="00:54:50.290" style="s2">else but I have to go but are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.790" end="00:54:53.740" style="s2">maybe we could continue this an athlete</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.870" end="00:56:05.940" style="s2">like why don&#39;t we just do it part of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.050" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">is we don&#39;t have 10,000 people right so</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.850" end="00:56:59.370" style="s2">once we figure it out um yeah Shiloh and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.730" end="00:57:03.570" style="s2">Eric what were your most powerful things</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.370" end="00:57:07.740" style="s2">they came up with meeting right now</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.740" end="00:57:11.490" style="s2">powerful things you think could be in</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.090" end="00:57:12.810" style="s2">place right now well not right now we</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.490" end="00:57:17.810" style="s2">would take time to code them but you</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.810" end="00:57:21.030" style="s2">know now it&#39;s super tough question to</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.810" end="00:57:24.290" style="s2">pick one cuz I kind of like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.030" end="00:57:28.350" style="s2">all of them being a part of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.290" end="00:57:29.940" style="s2">about you Eric yeah I mean something</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.350" end="00:57:31.770" style="s2">around the idea of restorative justice</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.940" end="00:57:33.540" style="s2">where as I said right at the start you</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.770" end="00:57:35.070" style="s2">know taking the whole word justice and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.540" end="00:57:38.690" style="s2">criminal out of the equation you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.070" end="00:57:40.650" style="s2">what I mean and recharacterizing it as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.690" end="00:57:42.900" style="s2">you know there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.650" end="00:57:45.660" style="s2">getting into planet and by conflict I</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.900" end="00:57:47.550" style="s2">mean things like you know stealing from</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.660" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">people as well right that&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.550" end="00:57:50.430" style="s2">conflict isn&#39;t it you&#39;ve deprived them</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:51.690" style="s2">of something they&#39;re pissed off about it</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.430" end="00:57:54.840" style="s2">right now you&#39;re in conflict with each</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.690" end="00:57:55.109" style="s2">other so you know their prize up and</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.840" end="00:57:57.239" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.109" end="00:57:59.489" style="s2">up and down the scale and the more you</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.239" end="00:58:01.079" style="s2">can knit stuff in the bud you know what</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.489" end="00:58:03.690" style="s2">I mean deal with it early the less it</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.079" end="00:58:05.819" style="s2">becomes big stuff that needs to be dealt</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.690" end="00:58:08.339" style="s2">with further down the road so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.819" end="00:58:10.559" style="s2">I&#39;m all-in on there and I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.339" end="00:58:12.920" style="s2">push back on a common wish I think might</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.559" end="00:58:15.390" style="s2">have been both of you actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.920" end="00:58:17.730" style="s2">like the choice between restorative</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.390" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">justice and punitive justice and I I</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.730" end="00:58:21.299" style="s2">disagree because if somebody wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:23.489" style="s2">down the road of units of justice</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.299" end="00:58:24.809" style="s2">they&#39;ll the next question is well what</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.489" end="00:58:26.069" style="s2">is it you want you know what I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.809" end="00:58:28.380" style="s2">mean assuming that they are found guilty</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.069" end="00:58:30.210" style="s2">what punishment is it you want answer</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.380" end="00:58:31.769" style="s2">and you know that conversation is part</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.210" end="00:58:34.019" style="s2">of the restorative justice system they</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.769" end="00:58:35.940" style="s2">sort of say the punishment can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.019" end="00:58:37.470" style="s2">part of that process right if this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.940" end="00:58:39.239" style="s2">what emerges from the process is this</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.470" end="00:58:41.160" style="s2">Merson stuff as a punishment and this</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.239" end="00:58:43.789" style="s2">person gets to say yes good I feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.160" end="00:58:47.069" style="s2">better now well so be it right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.789" end="00:58:48.960" style="s2">that remains an option so yeah I either</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.069" end="00:58:51.809" style="s2">the restorative justice is a big</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.960" end="00:58:53.940" style="s2">umbrella and if punishment is a part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.809" end="00:58:57.720" style="s2">the arrangement then as I say that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.940" end="00:59:02.039" style="s2">is that is scope don&#39;t I mentioned for</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.720" end="00:59:03.180" style="s2">that in particular I don&#39;t um I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.039" end="00:59:05.849" style="s2">agree with what I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.180" end="00:59:08.069" style="s2">Nessus like I don&#39;t and I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.849" end="00:59:09.690" style="s2">victims the victims using the whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.069" end="00:59:11.160" style="s2">it&#39;s punishment or restorative there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.690" end="00:59:12.390" style="s2">lot of issues with that because then if</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.160" end="00:59:13.739" style="s2">I steal from someone who&#39;s into</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.390" end="00:59:14.999" style="s2">restorative justice I get less of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.739" end="00:59:17.039" style="s2">punishment than if I steal for someone</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.999" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">who&#39;s not it&#39;s like the victims the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.039" end="00:59:20.369" style="s2">you got something stolen but like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">person who stole depending on who you</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.369" end="00:59:24.450" style="s2">stole from they get to choose which path</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">does your whole life right we see it all</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.450" end="00:59:27.660" style="s2">the time and it wouldn&#39;t someone&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:30.269" style="s2">I mean friends with my with the person I</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.660" end="00:59:32.099" style="s2">was victimized and that&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.269" end="00:59:34.109" style="s2">story but it&#39;s not the common place and</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.099" end="00:59:35.849" style="s2">so that person gets less of a punishment</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.109" end="00:59:37.739" style="s2">for everyone else gets more right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.849" end="00:59:40.440" style="s2">based on who they kind of chose luckily</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.739" end="00:59:43.829" style="s2">is their victim but necessarily right I</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.440" end="00:59:45.599" style="s2">mean you know you take the example of</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.829" end="00:59:46.859" style="s2">someone steal someone&#39;s wallet right</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.599" end="00:59:48.299" style="s2">someone leaves their wallet lying on a</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.859" end="00:59:49.739" style="s2">table and someone steals is they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.299" end="00:59:51.450" style="s2">assaulted them right they just pinched</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.739" end="00:59:54.299" style="s2">their wallet and it&#39;s a cheap nasty</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.450" end="00:59:55.559" style="s2">plastic wallet and they say there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.299" end="00:59:57.509" style="s2">money in it and they just throw it away</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.559" end="01:00:00.029" style="s2">right in the wallets gone now you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.509" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">in now in a punitive judge you if you to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.029" end="01:00:03.989" style="s2">go to court for that</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:06.150" style="s2">they would be there probably probation</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.989" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">maybe something like that right whereas</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.150" end="01:00:10.079" style="s2">in the restorative justice</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.160" end="01:00:11.700" style="s2">situation once you actually get into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.079" end="01:00:13.530" style="s2">case you find that in that cheap plastic</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.700" end="01:00:15.539" style="s2">wallet was a photograph of the girl&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.530" end="01:00:17.280" style="s2">brother who died three years ago and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.539" end="01:00:19.799" style="s2">the thing can&#39;t be replaced right and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:21.240" style="s2">she&#39;s traumatized and grieving over the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.799" end="01:00:25.940" style="s2">loss of this they even though it has no</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.240" end="01:00:25.940" style="s2">monetary value whatsoever and now the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.660" end="01:00:32.430" style="s2">retribution is the wrong word the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.450" end="01:00:34.950" style="s2">balancing the the rebalancing shall we</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.430" end="01:00:38.039" style="s2">say of this situation may involves very</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.950" end="01:00:39.480" style="s2">very much more than the simple probation</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.039" end="01:00:40.650" style="s2">they would have got in the pew statistic</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.480" end="01:00:43.140" style="s2">so this is what I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.650" end="01:00:46.500" style="s2">restorative justice can can can make the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.140" end="01:00:49.079" style="s2">context of the thing front and center</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.500" end="01:00:50.280" style="s2">you know the the actuality of the actual</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.079" end="01:00:52.980" style="s2">thing that actually happened to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.280" end="01:00:56.190" style="s2">actual people you know that makes that</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.980" end="01:00:57.660" style="s2">the the the thing right and if everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.190" end="01:00:59.970" style="s2">went through a story of justice I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.660" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">agree but the issue is that that person</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.970" end="01:01:03.809" style="s2">who lost their brothers pitt photo right</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:05.880" style="s2">or loved ones photo could be the person</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.809" end="01:01:07.079" style="s2">who&#39;s like it&#39;s only a photo my brother</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.880" end="01:01:08.760" style="s2">would have wanted me to do the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.079" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">restorative part and chosen that one and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.760" end="01:01:12.030" style="s2">the one who lost well I had to get a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:14.430" style="s2">noob license you understand a convenient</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.030" end="01:01:15.089" style="s2">memory it&#39;s not necessarily about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.430" end="01:01:17.549" style="s2">impact</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.089" end="01:01:20.309" style="s2">oh that&#39;s restorative justice it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.549" end="01:01:21.930" style="s2">my how much I feel I was impacted and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.309" end="01:01:26.789" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily the truth because I</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.930" end="01:01:28.770" style="s2">think that&#39;s my point is so that if</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.789" end="01:01:30.420" style="s2">everyone&#39;s restorative justice then okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.770" end="01:01:32.490" style="s2">that&#39;s the path but if the victim</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.420" end="01:01:34.049" style="s2">chooses whether restorative or this then</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.490" end="01:01:37.410" style="s2">it comes up with all of the will then</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.049" end="01:01:39.450" style="s2">the person committing the crime is its</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.410" end="01:01:41.220" style="s2">luck whether the person you perpetrated</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.450" end="01:01:43.230" style="s2">on is gonna choose punitive or sorta</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.220" end="01:01:44.309" style="s2">it&#39;s just the point that I was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.230" end="01:01:46.200" style="s2">make but I don&#39;t think I actually got to</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.309" end="01:01:48.930" style="s2">we are past the hour though I would like</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.200" end="01:01:50.160" style="s2">to say that the my most powerful thing I</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.930" end="01:01:51.660" style="s2">think we could do the ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.160" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">people hundred thousand is to ask people</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.660" end="01:01:54.210" style="s2">who committed crimes how the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:55.559" style="s2">conversation about what would have got</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.210" end="01:01:57.630" style="s2">like what would have been in place to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.559" end="01:02:00.329" style="s2">not because it&#39;s powerful information</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.630" end="01:02:01.710" style="s2">and I would love to see that happen but</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.329" end="01:02:03.660" style="s2">I also think one of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.710" end="01:02:05.609" style="s2">things 10,000 evil could do together to</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.660" end="01:02:08.250" style="s2">help the criminal justice system in</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.609" end="01:02:11.010" style="s2">general is start tracking judges and</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.250" end="01:02:13.710" style="s2">police officers for their racist or lack</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.010" end="01:02:15.420" style="s2">thereof and and be able to see more</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.710" end="01:02:17.579" style="s2">easily when someone gets shot well look</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.420" end="01:02:19.940" style="s2">at their long history of you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.579" end="01:02:21.900" style="s2">this was an isolated event or not</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.940" end="01:02:25.619" style="s2">because that also like when</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.900" end="01:02:28.260" style="s2">a black person experiences something in</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.619" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">the world it&#39;s gonna appear to them that</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.260" end="01:02:32.670" style="s2">it&#39;s racist and the question is with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:36.089" style="s2">person perpetrating it do it to a person</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.670" end="01:02:37.950" style="s2">who&#39;s not black or not and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.089" end="01:02:39.690" style="s2">know that without the data you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.950" end="01:02:42.119" style="s2">know that based on the black person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.690" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">experience right well the cop said X</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.119" end="01:02:45.720" style="s2">they&#39;re racist no did they say that to</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:47.940" style="s2">all of the like did they also say that</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.720" end="01:02:49.380" style="s2">to way like it takes data to actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.940" end="01:02:51.329" style="s2">see it and I don&#39;t even think the cop</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.380" end="01:02:54.089" style="s2">would know right they would need to see</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.329" end="01:02:56.220" style="s2">their own data and say oh my god you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.089" end="01:02:58.069" style="s2">right I do pourable I pull over black</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.220" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">people more than I love white people</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.069" end="01:03:02.520" style="s2">with that right like and then I give</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:05.549" style="s2">them tickets more often I didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.520" end="01:03:07.440" style="s2">know right like it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.549" end="01:03:09.089" style="s2">mean it&#39;s nefarious in fact it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.440" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">more dangerous when it&#39;s not because you</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.089" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know it is but anyway I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:13.829" style="s2">so I&#39;m sure I can serve you know my</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:15.329" style="s2">conversation that I think tracking the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.829" end="01:03:17.609" style="s2">data so that that information is there</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.329" end="01:03:18.990" style="s2">as well as having conversations of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.609" end="01:03:20.460" style="s2">people who&#39;ve been in it and having them</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.990" end="01:03:22.289" style="s2">generate the solutions</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.460" end="01:03:23.609" style="s2">howdy not because the reason I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.289" end="01:03:24.630" style="s2">want to move forward with doing this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.609" end="01:03:25.319" style="s2">there&#39;s only four of us having this</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.630" end="01:03:27.240" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.319" end="01:03:29.309" style="s2">there aren&#39;t 10,000 of us having</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.240" end="01:03:30.210" style="s2">thousands of us or just the option for</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.309" end="01:03:32.099" style="s2">thousands of people to have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.210" end="01:03:33.420" style="s2">conversation and then listing those</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.099" end="01:03:35.069" style="s2">conversations and picking the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.420" end="01:03:37.470" style="s2">powerful best solution and moving</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.069" end="01:03:39.510" style="s2">forward together as 10,000 with that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.470" end="01:03:41.640" style="s2">I think a very powerful once we figure</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.510" end="01:03:44.369" style="s2">even a tiny bit of that out everything</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.640" end="01:03:48.150" style="s2">happens rapidly Charlie what do you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.369" end="01:03:49.920" style="s2">think is the most powerful umm I love</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.150" end="01:03:51.779" style="s2">this idea of tracking as well I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.920" end="01:03:55.069" style="s2">that would be very helpful but I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.779" end="01:03:58.230" style="s2">it would be pretty helpful as well if we</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.069" end="01:04:00.089" style="s2">required people except for maybe murder</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.230" end="01:04:02.549" style="s2">and read or I don&#39;t know even that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.089" end="01:04:04.349" style="s2">think anyone that commits a crime maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.549" end="01:04:06.869" style="s2">they have to start with restorative</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.349" end="01:04:08.609" style="s2">justice with their first three crimes</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.869" end="01:04:10.920" style="s2">and hopefully there isn&#39;t a fourth one</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.609" end="01:04:13.109" style="s2">or whatever and then they start to go</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.920" end="01:04:15.660" style="s2">into the punitive system at least that</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.109" end="01:04:17.880" style="s2">would give an opportunity for because I</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.660" end="01:04:20.279" style="s2">like the idea and just straight-up</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.880" end="01:04:24.270" style="s2">restorative justice and from the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.279" end="01:04:26.970" style="s2">beginning and I love the idea of making</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.270" end="01:04:29.130" style="s2">like I think what we lack in society is</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.970" end="01:04:31.200" style="s2">making those connections and so as Eric</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.130" end="01:04:33.210" style="s2">was saying once you start to have that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:35.099" style="s2">human and interaction with someone and</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.210" end="01:04:37.410" style="s2">start to see their what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.099" end="01:04:38.940" style="s2">it&#39;s drastically different than just</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.410" end="01:04:41.400" style="s2">knowing you&#39;ve done a crime and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.940" end="01:04:44.609" style="s2">trying to either hide it or ignore it or</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.400" end="01:04:50.640" style="s2">whatever or distance yourself from it it</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.609" end="01:04:52.769" style="s2">makes it&#39;s just a huge difference - Eric</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.640" end="01:04:55.739" style="s2">did you share yours he said he said you</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.769" end="01:04:56.970" style="s2">kind of not really very clear but</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.739" end="01:05:00.239" style="s2">something is something around that</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.970" end="01:05:02.670" style="s2">notion you know as I was saying before</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.239" end="01:05:04.829" style="s2">and this comes back to what both of you</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.670" end="01:05:06.239" style="s2">are also saying earlier on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.829" end="01:05:07.890" style="s2">something like I remember reading a</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.239" end="01:05:09.930" style="s2">stack a while ago and it may not be</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.890" end="01:05:13.109" style="s2">quite right but it&#39;s something like 90%</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.930" end="01:05:15.630" style="s2">of all crimes are either crimes of</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.109" end="01:05:17.009" style="s2">acquisition or are drug related you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.630" end="01:05:18.450" style="s2">crimes of acquisition the thefts</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.009" end="01:05:20.599" style="s2">robberies fraud you know I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.450" end="01:05:24.180" style="s2">trying to get something off someone else</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.599" end="01:05:25.619" style="s2">it&#39;s so 90% or more are crimes of</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.180" end="01:05:29.160" style="s2">acquisition and drug relation which</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.619" end="01:05:30.839" style="s2">means that less than 10% are violent</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.160" end="01:05:32.329" style="s2">crimes murders rapes in fact a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.839" end="01:05:34.529" style="s2">violent crimes are associated with</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.329" end="01:05:36.089" style="s2">stealing from people right armed</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.529" end="01:05:38.670" style="s2">robberies muggings that kind of thing a</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.089" end="01:05:42.989" style="s2">lot of that is sort of just aggravated</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.670" end="01:05:44.099" style="s2">kinds of acquisition and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.989" end="01:05:45.930" style="s2">with what you were saying if you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.099" end="01:05:48.420" style="s2">change the landscape where people no</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.930" end="01:05:49.950" style="s2">longer are desperate enough to commit</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.420" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">crimes in order to get stuff that they</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.950" end="01:05:53.489" style="s2">need and I listen I get it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:05:56.039" style="s2">that sometimes it is just greed as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.489" end="01:05:58.319" style="s2">but nevertheless greed is incentivized</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.039" end="01:06:00.180" style="s2">right having more stuff to get all</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.319" end="01:06:02.579" style="s2">Staters this is all incentivizing the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.180" end="01:06:04.410" style="s2">society so none of this really has you</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.579" end="01:06:07.079" style="s2">all said earlier on goes away without</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.410" end="01:06:12.210" style="s2">everything else also changing at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.079" end="01:06:14.519" style="s2">same time and I think yeah we try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.210" end="01:06:17.910" style="s2">instead that helping people not have</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.519" end="01:06:19.769" style="s2">that need for more and more money is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.910" end="01:06:21.420" style="s2">solution so it&#39;s like figuring out food</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.769" end="01:06:23.279" style="s2">finger no clothing figuring out shelter</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.420" end="01:06:25.499" style="s2">and energy and education without needing</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.279" end="01:06:28.109" style="s2">to put out more money helps with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.499" end="01:06:29.519" style="s2">prison system right like it actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.109" end="01:06:31.619" style="s2">bigger away than tackling the prison</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.519" end="01:06:33.569" style="s2">system yeah the prison system is a bad</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.619" end="01:06:35.190" style="s2">now and we need to tackle it so like</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.569" end="01:06:37.619" style="s2">having different people working on all</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.190" end="01:06:39.329" style="s2">of these different fronts everything you</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.619" end="01:06:43.799" style="s2">come about and there&#39;s new things as</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.329" end="01:06:46.130" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about yeah all right we&#39;re</p>
