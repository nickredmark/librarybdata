<p begin="00:00:00.210" end="00:00:06.060" style="s2">all right welcome to the board meeting I</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:08.370" style="s2">don&#39;t think we need to number them the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.060" end="00:00:10.710" style="s2">world Friday I don&#39;t know what number</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.370" end="00:00:12.389" style="s2">this is our third or fourth but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.710" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">we&#39;re moving forward that&#39;s all that</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:17.840" style="s2">matters and when someone else joins they</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">can just jump in wherever but they are</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.840" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">this one doesn&#39;t have usually tells us</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:23.340" style="s2">how many people are on but I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:25.800" style="s2">that here maybe it&#39;s cause no one&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.340" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">or it&#39;s also different YouTube and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:34.489" style="s2">Facebook and periscope are all slightly</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">different in stream your idea how was I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.489" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">have a we had committed last week to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:42.690" style="s2">comparing notes I think on the scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">was a scheduler specific or was it just</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.690" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">all of the features and benefits</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">features the goal was mostly the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:51.960" style="s2">scheduler because that&#39;s the the piece</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">we kind of know we need but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.960" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">other ideas we can also discuss all</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">right yeah my brain likes to do it all</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">as opposed to you know which pieces are</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">just the scheduler but I had it broken</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">down I was trying to do it the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">individual piece of like what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">individual account needs and then what</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">like the system needs and then it kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:14.100" style="s2">of got broken down further into what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:16.350" style="s2">individual Ike what we need before</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.100" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">someone comes from India cafe during the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.350" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">idea cafe and then after the voting and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">then a bit of the individual and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">one so it&#39;s like six different things</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">that aren&#39;t quite right some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.710" end="00:01:35.299" style="s2">all interconnected but were you able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">sit down with it this week or I was not</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.299" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">but I think as we go through your ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">I will be reminded of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:48.119" style="s2">thought of earlier so I think will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:50.600" style="s2">good okay so the time zone coordination</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.119" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">is a big one just being able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.600" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">coordinate between time zones that I get</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">it in my time zone and you get it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">your time zone and then because we might</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">want to try different iterations of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">the idea cafe is having having the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">ability to play with the time slot where</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:12.730" style="s2">it starts and goes for a duration right</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.730" end="00:02:17.799" style="s2">consistently set up to be a half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">but maybe we want it to go past like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.799" end="00:02:20.890" style="s2">don&#39;t want to cut people off at half an</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:22.540" style="s2">hour because often you&#39;re still in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.890" end="00:02:23.950" style="s2">middle of the sentence you&#39;re still kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.540" end="00:02:26.950" style="s2">of winding down at the end of half an</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.950" end="00:02:28.180" style="s2">hour and so potentially based on what</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.950" end="00:02:29.739" style="s2">people are using this for they might</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.180" end="00:02:31.480" style="s2">want to go for an hour time slot or</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.739" end="00:02:33.069" style="s2">maybe even a four hour time slot if</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.480" end="00:02:36.090" style="s2">they&#39;re working at with a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.069" end="00:02:38.709" style="s2">group on something so just being able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.090" end="00:02:41.019" style="s2">so then that was just notes in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.709" end="00:02:43.900" style="s2">particular the individual piece for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.019" end="00:02:45.459" style="s2">individual accounts I have here that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.900" end="00:02:48.040" style="s2">individual to put in their total</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.459" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">availability so kind of like we did with</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.040" end="00:02:51.700" style="s2">the doodle poll right like right across</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:54.489" style="s2">the board here&#39;s our like my</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.700" end="00:02:56.769" style="s2">availability and so the scheduler to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.489" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">able to compare those and then schedule</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.769" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">people write that if it&#39;s gonna be more</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:05.140" style="s2">broad be put in the topics of interest</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:07.060" style="s2">that I want to be alerted to if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.140" end="00:03:09.640" style="s2">something in my availability that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.060" end="00:03:11.560" style="s2">available to me right I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.640" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">especially if it gets big it&#39;s Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:14.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to be in I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:15.549" style="s2">know every time there&#39;s a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.440" end="00:03:17.620" style="s2">but I want to know when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.549" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">conversations the people that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.620" end="00:03:21.430" style="s2">interested in or the topics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:25.319" style="s2">interested in they&#39;re within my time</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.430" end="00:03:27.970" style="s2">frame and then the invitation piece that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.319" end="00:03:30.099" style="s2">they need to be able to get the link so</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.970" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">in the especially the beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.099" end="00:03:33.730" style="s2">where we&#39;re not Facebook people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:36.430" style="s2">going to know to check it so to be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.730" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">to email them right to be able to say to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.430" end="00:03:40.269" style="s2">be able to connect them on their phones</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:43.329" style="s2">or email a way for them to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.269" end="00:03:45.160" style="s2">know yes we&#39;ve scheduled you now for a 2</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.329" end="00:03:46.989" style="s2">p.m. one and possibly I&#39;m just this just</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.160" end="00:03:48.849" style="s2">coming to me now that I think we all</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.989" end="00:03:50.230" style="s2">have a slightly different tell me I do</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.849" end="00:03:53.230" style="s2">want me to slow down by the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.230" end="00:03:58.269" style="s2">taking notes no I&#39;m keeping up with you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.230" end="00:04:02.230" style="s2">at the top is that one is I get to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.269" end="00:04:03.879" style="s2">how many um like if maybe by weeks wide</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.230" end="00:04:05.440" style="s2">open schedule me 24/7</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.879" end="00:04:07.930" style="s2">but I only want to talk for three</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.440" end="00:04:09.940" style="s2">conversations of half an hour right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.930" end="00:04:11.859" style="s2">be able to put in my overall</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.940" end="00:04:14.620" style="s2">availability and also my preferences for</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.859" end="00:04:17.889" style="s2">the maximum number of conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.620" end="00:04:23.349" style="s2">there was another piece of that oh how</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.889" end="00:04:25.060" style="s2">much what&#39;s the word how much in advance</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.349" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">I want to know about it right it could</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.060" end="00:04:28.450" style="s2">be hey there&#39;s a conversation happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:30.070" style="s2">right now if you&#39;re interested in it or</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.450" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">maybe I prefer to know a week in advance</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.070" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">or 24 hours in advance and if it could</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.130" end="00:04:38.290" style="s2">be individually scheduled for the person</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:39.730" style="s2">then people who like having that last</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.290" end="00:04:41.200" style="s2">minute can&#39;t come on and be like hey I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.730" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">five minutes my kids nappy and I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.200" end="00:04:44.530" style="s2">come on for half an hour right and other</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:48.669" style="s2">people want it to be more so having that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.530" end="00:04:51.639" style="s2">that diversity of individual preferences</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.669" end="00:04:53.260" style="s2">I heard you said the invitation number</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.639" end="00:04:55.720" style="s2">of conversations per week I have on here</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.260" end="00:04:59.020" style="s2">and then that other piece we had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.720" end="00:05:00.820" style="s2">talked about last week of like as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.020" end="00:05:03.460" style="s2">individual what I need to have in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.820" end="00:05:05.560" style="s2">conversation and maybe what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.460" end="00:05:07.150" style="s2">have in a conversation so a need for me</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.560" end="00:05:08.770" style="s2">it actually kind of goes in-between</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.150" end="00:05:10.030" style="s2">because I could theoretically have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.770" end="00:05:12.070" style="s2">conversation with somebody who&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.030" end="00:05:13.930" style="s2">voice but it&#39;s gonna be much more taxing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.070" end="00:05:16.210" style="s2">for my brain I prefer it to be on video</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.930" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">so I&#39;d prefer everyone at my table to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.210" end="00:05:19.450" style="s2">on video other people are gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:21.910" style="s2">opposite preference or they want</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.450" end="00:05:23.020" style="s2">everyone to be on voice or they want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.910" end="00:05:25.690" style="s2">be on voice and they don&#39;t care what</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.020" end="00:05:27.040" style="s2">anyone else is on I imagine with</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.690" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">different disabilities and with</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.040" end="00:05:31.000" style="s2">different just diversity there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.560" end="00:05:32.680" style="s2">be different things that people need or</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:34.419" style="s2">want so just being able to even just</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.680" end="00:05:38.050" style="s2">type it in so we can include in the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.419" end="00:05:39.340" style="s2">iteration right my need is to not have</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.050" end="00:05:41.290" style="s2">this at English because I speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.340" end="00:05:47.229" style="s2">Cantonese right like whatever it happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.290" end="00:05:48.280" style="s2">to be we can then see a way like if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.229" end="00:05:50.440" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean how do people put it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.280" end="00:05:52.390" style="s2">Cantonese and therefore we could that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.440" end="00:05:54.130" style="s2">would be our next focus for opening up a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.390" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">new language probably just having</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.130" end="00:05:56.950" style="s2">languages languages you speak that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:59.650" style="s2">would like to have these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.950" end="00:06:02.919" style="s2">and right it&#39;s going to start with just</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.530" end="00:07:17.770" style="s2">just typing because there&#39;s also that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.440" end="00:07:20.350" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.770" end="00:07:22.780" style="s2">do prefer just typing but I also feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.350" end="00:07:24.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things out there that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.780" end="00:07:26.680" style="s2">are typing like if you like connection</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.610" end="00:07:29.139" style="s2">through typing there are a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.680" end="00:07:30.790" style="s2">avenues to get that I don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.139" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">connections through typing I need it to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.790" end="00:07:36.280" style="s2">be voice or video in order to I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:37.690" style="s2">know comprehend that it&#39;s a human being</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.280" end="00:07:39.220" style="s2">on the other line and feel that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.690" end="00:07:41.320" style="s2">connection right whereas other people</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.220" end="00:07:43.570" style="s2">don&#39;t feel safe like that and they want</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.320" end="00:07:45.940" style="s2">to have typing but to just know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.570" end="00:07:47.560" style="s2">some people are like that and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.940" end="00:07:49.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to integrate all of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.560" end="00:07:52.270" style="s2">where for some people who don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.570" end="00:07:55.300" style="s2">being at a table with voice video and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.270" end="00:07:56.349" style="s2">typing that it would I guess he said I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.300" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you see it I guess it</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.349" end="00:08:01.780" style="s2">depends on the participants put it up</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.220" style="s2">here yeah which makes sense and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.780" end="00:08:05.979" style="s2">big piece about it&#39;s like how safe do</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.220" end="00:08:08.410" style="s2">you feel right you might start out that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.979" end="00:08:09.849" style="s2">you want to just watch and then but</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.410" end="00:08:13.690" style="s2">other people might not be feel safe with</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.849" end="00:08:15.639" style="s2">you watching so having the ability at</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.690" end="00:08:17.860" style="s2">the table to record it the ability at</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.639" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">the table to say whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.860" end="00:08:21.070" style="s2">comfortable having people watch it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:22.780" style="s2">right I&#39;d be comfortable with people</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.070" end="00:08:26.440" style="s2">watching it depending on the topic some</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.780" end="00:08:27.580" style="s2">topics may be less so-and-so needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.440" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">someone so as the individual and then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.580" end="00:08:32.770" style="s2">have it broken down a bit here on what</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:35.140" style="s2">we would want before somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.770" end="00:08:37.959" style="s2">participated during the participation a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.140" end="00:08:41.500" style="s2">few of the features and the voting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.959" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">the after so for before I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.500" end="00:08:46.120" style="s2">an intro video something that explains</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:48.100" style="s2">what an idea Cafe is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.120" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">expected to watch before coming on so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.100" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have to have the intro every time</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">what this is and what this looks like</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:58.300" style="s2">as well as a video if we have our terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:00.400" style="s2">and conditions I would like that to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.300" end="00:09:02.890" style="s2">in a video format to be like okay this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.400" end="00:09:04.840" style="s2">is what just so you know you can get</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.890" end="00:09:06.700" style="s2">triggered this can be emotionally like</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.840" end="00:09:08.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a video it&#39;s only a video like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.700" end="00:09:10.180" style="s2">whatever our legalese has to be having</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.530" end="00:09:12.520" style="s2">it more in a video like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.180" end="00:09:13.990" style="s2">you&#39;re signing up for and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.520" end="00:09:15.880" style="s2">time we want to continually improve it</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.990" end="00:09:18.010" style="s2">but this is all of ours right what do</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.880" end="00:09:21.910" style="s2">you call it again terms and conditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.010" end="00:09:23.590" style="s2">is what I own and those would probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.910" end="00:09:25.090" style="s2">be two separate ones were you like hey</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.590" end="00:09:26.980" style="s2">if you watched the terms and conditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.090" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">or read it if you want to but like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.980" end="00:09:32.140" style="s2">made it an easy language for you to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:33.850" style="s2">watch as well to expect that people have</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.140" end="00:09:35.410" style="s2">actually done it unlike every time I</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.850" end="00:09:38.500" style="s2">check off the box and have in no way</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.410" end="00:09:40.570" style="s2">read the terms and conditions but</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.500" end="00:09:42.250" style="s2">especially since it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.570" end="00:09:43.720" style="s2">simultaneously something that can stir</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.250" end="00:09:45.430" style="s2">up a lot of emotions and be quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.720" end="00:09:49.470" style="s2">traumatizing and at the same time is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.430" end="00:09:53.890" style="s2">only a conversation right so like</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.470" end="00:09:56.170" style="s2">knowing to set up the person for success</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.890" end="00:09:59.590" style="s2">for like this could happen so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.170" end="00:10:02.980" style="s2">aware and getting feedback right what</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.590" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">what was what I don&#39;t want is people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.980" end="00:10:07.930" style="s2">sue right to come on like a normal</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:09.460" style="s2">platform that we own and they don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.930" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">we&#39;re in responsible for their</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.460" end="00:10:13.270" style="s2">experience and then they sue because it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.380" end="00:10:15.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the experience they wanted not</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.270" end="00:10:18.040" style="s2">saying that couldn&#39;t possibly happen but</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.280" end="00:10:20.350" style="s2">like the idea is it&#39;s our platform right</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.040" end="00:10:22.450" style="s2">so just like if I hurt your feelings</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.350" end="00:10:25.270" style="s2">right here you could come and sue me but</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.450" end="00:10:26.860" style="s2">that&#39;s not really gonna I don&#39;t have any</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:33.190" style="s2">different energy when it&#39;s a small group</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.810" end="00:10:35.320" style="s2">or a different energy when we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.190" end="00:10:37.270" style="s2">our project and that&#39;s what I want</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.320" end="00:10:39.340" style="s2">everyone to feel this is our project if</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.560" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">making it better so that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:46.180" style="s2">happen was it the people at the table</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:48.220" style="s2">was it the question was it you know what</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.180" end="00:10:50.170" style="s2">I mean like to empower people to know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.220" end="00:10:54.100" style="s2">that it it&#39;s not that your experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.170" end="00:10:55.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t matter but it&#39;s that it we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.100" end="00:10:57.130" style="s2">not responsible for your experience and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.720" end="00:10:58.630" style="s2">yet everyone&#39;s responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.130" end="00:11:01.990" style="s2">everyone&#39;s experience at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.630" end="00:11:05.089" style="s2">like how can we improve it so that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.990" end="00:11:06.739" style="s2">keeps improving getting better</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.089" end="00:11:07.879" style="s2">all right this is uh or Nestle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.739" end="00:11:10.149" style="s2">conversation to put up popped up here</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.879" end="00:11:12.469" style="s2">like a one on one or five on one meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.149" end="00:11:16.249" style="s2">proportion how much each participant can</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.469" end="00:11:19.459" style="s2">or is expected to participate and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.249" end="00:11:22.069" style="s2">that&#39;s a piece of both the intro video I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.459" end="00:11:24.739" style="s2">believe as well as the iterations right</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.069" end="00:11:26.269" style="s2">that like that is a good some people the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.739" end="00:11:28.579" style="s2">idea cafe isn&#39;t meant to be a one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.269" end="00:11:30.859" style="s2">conversation but there might be a tool</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.579" end="00:11:33.139" style="s2">for like oh we had conflict maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.859" end="00:11:34.939" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to walk through without</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.139" end="00:11:36.199" style="s2">there being a third person a way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.939" end="00:11:38.479" style="s2">resolve that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.199" end="00:11:39.949" style="s2">it&#39;s almost automated and then that gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.479" end="00:11:44.599" style="s2">too much and it&#39;s escalated to like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.949" end="00:11:47.029" style="s2">more it&#39;s a host or something or just I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.599" end="00:11:48.709" style="s2">say I love the three people idea cafes</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.029" end="00:11:50.389" style="s2">those are my favorite ones and so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.709" end="00:11:52.249" style="s2">I set my parameter to that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.389" end="00:11:53.629" style="s2">would like and other people who are more</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.249" end="00:11:55.099" style="s2">introverted and would like to listen</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.629" end="00:11:57.109" style="s2">more than they talk my prefer a four</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.099" end="00:11:58.849" style="s2">percent or a five percent and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.109" end="00:12:01.429" style="s2">part of the diversity I think of saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.849" end="00:12:03.889" style="s2">how many people you prefer I&#39;m also okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.429" end="00:12:05.449" style="s2">having a one-on-one other people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.889" end="00:12:08.359" style="s2">be because there&#39;s more focus on them as</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.449" end="00:12:09.499" style="s2">well as more if something goes wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.359" end="00:12:11.719" style="s2">it&#39;s not being recorded he-said she-said</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.499" end="00:12:15.049" style="s2">right like she said they said they said</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.719" end="00:12:18.589" style="s2">like the piece of that and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.049" end="00:12:21.859" style="s2">think you are not so important piece and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.589" end="00:12:24.409" style="s2">sorry during the intro video the idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.859" end="00:12:27.259" style="s2">Cafe on YouTube isn&#39;t really set up that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.409" end="00:12:28.999" style="s2">somebody passes but it&#39;s also allowed</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.259" end="00:12:31.429" style="s2">right if you want to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.999" end="00:12:33.349" style="s2">conversation but you don&#39;t want to share</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.429" end="00:12:35.299" style="s2">in the first five minutes that&#39;s allowed</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.349" end="00:12:38.509" style="s2">if you&#39;re just someone who would rather</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.299" end="00:12:40.339" style="s2">listen more than speak you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.509" end="00:12:44.239" style="s2">allowed to speak but you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.339" end="00:12:46.089" style="s2">write it this isn&#39;t a in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.239" end="00:12:50.329" style="s2">almost the opposite you don&#39;t want to um</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.089" end="00:12:51.619" style="s2">oh yeah another that&#39;s it good interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.329" end="00:12:52.789" style="s2">it well and that&#39;s part of the needs and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.619" end="00:12:54.439" style="s2">wants right if you&#39;re someone who gets</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.789" end="00:12:56.479" style="s2">really triggered by people interrupting</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.439" end="00:12:58.879" style="s2">you maybe there&#39;s one that&#39;s like zero</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.479" end="00:13:00.439" style="s2">interruption and other ones like me and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.879" end="00:13:02.059" style="s2">my brother tomorrow were like when the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.439" end="00:13:03.379" style="s2">third person joins us we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.059" end="00:13:06.229" style="s2">to learn how to not interrupt each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.379" end="00:13:09.619" style="s2">because our family dynamic is very keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.229" end="00:13:12.529" style="s2">speaking until the other one jumps in it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.619" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">is like there is no way to not do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.529" end="00:13:18.920" style="s2">between us so that was before the video</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">so before</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.920" end="00:13:22.279" style="s2">people even sign up to get them set up</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:24.230" style="s2">for success that they know what this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.279" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">even having one of like hey you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.230" end="00:13:28.579" style="s2">watch one on a topic you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:30.980" style="s2">in right so that one that has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.579" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">recorded right now that is the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.980" end="00:13:36.649" style="s2">channel right like go there look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:37.880" style="s2">what what&#39;s already there or like a rule</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.649" end="00:13:39.560" style="s2">of make a button yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.880" end="00:13:40.760" style="s2">which allows you to interrupt the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.560" end="00:13:43.190" style="s2">speaker to make sure you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.760" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">understanding or just like put up your</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.190" end="00:13:45.380" style="s2">hand right so I don&#39;t really even</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:48.199" style="s2">interrupt you but you&#39;re like I have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.380" end="00:13:50.779" style="s2">question and that might be added to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.199" end="00:13:52.850" style="s2">jury like during a conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.779" end="00:13:54.350" style="s2">features that would be good and we had</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.850" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">talked about the the Talking Stick</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.350" end="00:13:58.910" style="s2">feature may be called something</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:01.310" style="s2">different but the Talking Stick we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.910" end="00:14:03.230" style="s2">also well you&#39;re talking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.310" end="00:14:07.130" style="s2">effectively you have it and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.230" end="00:14:09.620" style="s2">else is muted but if I don&#39;t shut up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.130" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">I&#39;m just talking for 20 minutes it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.620" end="00:14:12.470" style="s2">designed that way it&#39;s designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:14.360" style="s2">five minutes but it keeps flashing hey</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.470" end="00:14:15.649" style="s2">it&#39;s been five minutes and I keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.360" end="00:14:17.149" style="s2">talking you know I mean that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.649" end="00:14:18.980" style="s2">way to maybe override that there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.149" end="00:14:20.870" style="s2">for the group to without them just</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.980" end="00:14:22.940" style="s2">leaving maybe kicking me out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.870" end="00:14:24.440" style="s2">know unless the feature is just after</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.940" end="00:14:27.170" style="s2">five minutes it goes to the next person</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.440" end="00:14:28.970" style="s2">cut you off half sentence which could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.170" end="00:14:31.970" style="s2">right that could be part of what we try</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.970" end="00:14:33.740" style="s2">and this is the point is to have I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.970" end="00:14:35.329" style="s2">the coder I&#39;m in no way it capable of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.740" end="00:14:39.050" style="s2">doing that but like how easy is it to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.329" end="00:14:41.060" style="s2">put in there&#39;s the beta and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.050" end="00:14:43.459" style="s2">the iterations right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.060" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">iterations if they&#39;re designed that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.459" end="00:14:46.820" style="s2">know that that could be it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.410" end="00:14:48.170" style="s2">design in the beginning to have it as</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.820" end="00:14:49.699" style="s2">simple as possible and then when</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.170" end="00:14:51.230" style="s2">someone&#39;s like I would like to cut them</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.699" end="00:14:52.339" style="s2">off mid-sentence we can try that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.230" end="00:14:54.230" style="s2">when someone&#39;s like I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.339" end="00:14:58.100" style="s2">cut off in sentence we can try that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.230" end="00:15:01.190" style="s2">have the the diversity of what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.100" end="00:15:03.529" style="s2">so that was jury on a timer like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.190" end="00:15:05.089" style="s2">literal timer and if I would rather not</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.529" end="00:15:08.390" style="s2">see it while I&#39;m talking maybe I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.089" end="00:15:10.640" style="s2">turn mine off but knowing that I&#39;m how</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.390" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">close to five minutes I&#39;ve gotten is is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.640" end="00:15:15.139" style="s2">good this isn&#39;t really a jury not this</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:16.730" style="s2">would be powerful not so much in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.139" end="00:15:19.699" style="s2">beta but later on I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.730" end="00:15:22.190" style="s2">mentioned this before is stats like just</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.699" end="00:15:23.660" style="s2">like how much I talked in the 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.190" end="00:15:25.519" style="s2">right like that would be part of voice</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.660" end="00:15:26.990" style="s2">recognition like even if it wasn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.519" end="00:15:28.819" style="s2">that would be again a feature of is</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.990" end="00:15:30.620" style="s2">everyone at the table comfortable doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.819" end="00:15:32.329" style="s2">that but I think there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.620" end="00:15:32.700" style="s2">information in the data there that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.329" end="00:15:35.460" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.700" end="00:15:38.220" style="s2">have access to like how much do I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.460" end="00:15:40.110" style="s2">monopolize a conversation versus what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.220" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">think I monopolize and what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.110" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">is very different how much do I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:46.830" style="s2">interrupt people anyone and how much do</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:48.750" style="s2">I interrupt like men versus women people</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.830" end="00:15:50.850" style="s2">of color versus you know people I</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.750" end="00:15:52.530" style="s2">perceive as white like like saying is</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.850" end="00:15:54.660" style="s2">that I&#39;m not gonna be consciously</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.530" end="00:15:56.310" style="s2">thinking of like I&#39;m not like oh I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.660" end="00:15:57.870" style="s2">interrupt this person no problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.310" end="00:15:59.970" style="s2">gonna be that subconscious underlining</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.870" end="00:16:01.320" style="s2">that I would I would person like to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.970" end="00:16:03.570" style="s2">access to information</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.320" end="00:16:05.070" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t necessarily want you to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.570" end="00:16:06.630" style="s2">access to my information unless we were</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.070" end="00:16:10.530" style="s2">part of a conversation it was just hey</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.630" end="00:16:13.500" style="s2">Jubilee spoke for 20 of the 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.530" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">unless there was a really good reason to</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.500" end="00:16:22.590" style="s2">do that I need to own that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:23.430" style="s2">monopolize less what this symbol I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.590" end="00:16:24.960" style="s2">people should be able to assemble</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.430" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">conversation rules themselves yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.960" end="00:16:27.480" style="s2">would be great</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:29.010" style="s2">especially in later iterations but just</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.480" end="00:16:32.520" style="s2">like is what I was talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.010" end="00:16:33.030" style="s2">the threshold of usability out that to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.520" end="00:16:35.580" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.030" end="00:16:36.510" style="s2">if we have 12 people on the on it not</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.580" end="00:16:38.070" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna be able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.510" end="00:16:39.420" style="s2">conversation that works for them</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.070" end="00:16:41.310" style="s2">we&#39;re back we&#39;re not really doing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.420" end="00:16:42.600" style="s2">platform with 12 people we&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.310" end="00:16:44.610" style="s2">the YouTube channel until there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.600" end="00:16:46.080" style="s2">interest hopefully to like build</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.610" end="00:16:48.450" style="s2">something that already has a number of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.080" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">people interested but then so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.450" end="00:16:51.840" style="s2">we&#39;re building it for game B</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:54.780" style="s2">specifically or fright ends for together</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.840" end="00:16:57.930" style="s2">text specifically then we have maybe 500</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.780" end="00:17:00.060" style="s2">a population of 500 that we then want is</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.930" end="00:17:02.460" style="s2">scheduled throughout a week right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.060" end="00:17:03.750" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna want to schedule a 24/7</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.460" end="00:17:05.459" style="s2">conversation there isn&#39;t gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.750" end="00:17:07.650" style="s2">threshold of people there to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.459" end="00:17:10.199" style="s2">interest and same with when we first</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.650" end="00:17:12.030" style="s2">start in a new category when we first</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.199" end="00:17:14.699" style="s2">start in a new language right if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.030" end="00:17:16.680" style="s2">if there&#39;s five people who want to speak</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.699" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">Spanish we can set them up right away if</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.680" end="00:17:19.470" style="s2">they all at the same time zone right oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:23.010" style="s2">sorry they all have the same schedule</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.470" end="00:17:25.380" style="s2">and areas of interest but as we branch</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.010" end="00:17:29.580" style="s2">into new ones we want to make sure the</p>

<p begin="00:17:29.580" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">enough to make that usable right like</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.890" end="00:17:37.020" style="s2">scheduling one a week as opposed to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:38.310" style="s2">know you might show up and have one</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.020" end="00:17:39.930" style="s2">other person if that makes sense like</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.310" end="00:17:41.580" style="s2">making sure that and I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.930" end="00:17:46.050" style="s2">that is also in the rules of assembly of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.580" end="00:17:47.190" style="s2">a conversation that the more niche I</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.050" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">need to get on a converse</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.190" end="00:17:52.500" style="s2">for me the less likely I&#39;m to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:55.110" style="s2">find people but when there&#39;s millions of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:17:56.730" style="s2">people on it if that happens then</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.110" end="00:17:58.200" style="s2">yeah sky&#39;s the limit right then I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.730" end="00:18:00.120" style="s2">have all of my needs and wants met in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.200" end="00:18:02.550" style="s2">language in my timezone in the area of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.120" end="00:18:04.610" style="s2">interest that I want and it can tell me</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.550" end="00:18:06.600" style="s2">like oh well if you opened up your</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.610" end="00:18:08.790" style="s2">language you could speak to so many more</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.600" end="00:18:10.350" style="s2">people hmm too bad I can&#39;t like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.790" end="00:18:13.050" style="s2">speak but like if you open up your time</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.350" end="00:18:15.240" style="s2">period right if you open up your to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.050" end="00:18:17.100" style="s2">able to show me that expansion kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.240" end="00:18:18.780" style="s2">like when you buy a airplane ticket and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.100" end="00:18:20.040" style="s2">you&#39;re staying on this state but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.780" end="00:18:21.930" style="s2">like but if you went on this state it</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.040" end="00:18:23.130" style="s2">could be this much cheaper right like to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.930" end="00:18:25.890" style="s2">kind of I don&#39;t know what that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.130" end="00:18:30.450" style="s2">look like visually but wherever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.890" end="00:18:33.270" style="s2">able to coordinate the conversation hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.450" end="00:18:34.590" style="s2">if you if you if you were willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.270" end="00:18:36.600" style="s2">on video there&#39;s more people available</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.590" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">right if you were willing to not be on</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.600" end="00:18:42.540" style="s2">video there&#39;s more people creating a</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:43.950" style="s2">meta conversation assembly - and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.540" end="00:18:46.470" style="s2">what like I mean that would be ideal</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.950" end="00:18:47.940" style="s2">that this tool could be used for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.470" end="00:18:51.630" style="s2">who wants to have any conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:53.580" style="s2">brings in the people but it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.630" end="00:18:56.280" style="s2">beta has a very specific and it will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.580" end="00:18:59.040" style="s2">very focused right so that it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.280" end="00:19:01.020" style="s2">cheaper you don&#39;t know what&#39;s starting</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.040" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">and then builds out from from there</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.020" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:07.350" style="s2">and then so that was the jury and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:11.160" style="s2">think that was a lot of stuff that comes</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.350" end="00:19:13.350" style="s2">up as I&#39;m talking yeah the vote so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.160" end="00:19:14.790" style="s2">other thing is we want to be able to not</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.350" end="00:19:16.650" style="s2">just say your areas of interest but then</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.790" end="00:19:18.660" style="s2">how do we generate a question for people</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.650" end="00:19:20.550" style="s2">to have a conversation around and part</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.660" end="00:19:22.410" style="s2">of the iteration is there might be times</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.550" end="00:19:23.730" style="s2">when we&#39;re not having a question right</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.410" end="00:19:25.020" style="s2">that people prefer not to have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.730" end="00:19:28.500" style="s2">question to answer and they prefer just</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.020" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">open dialogue but the idea Cafe is very</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.500" end="00:19:33.960" style="s2">specifically designed around a question</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:35.700" style="s2">right now and so how do we craft a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.960" end="00:19:37.140" style="s2">converse how do we craft a question and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.700" end="00:19:40.800" style="s2">that&#39;s about maybe a different video or</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.140" end="00:19:42.600" style="s2">a different learning period of um here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.800" end="00:19:44.250" style="s2">what a good question is right and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.600" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">we have the feedback into the system of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.250" end="00:19:47.580" style="s2">here&#39;s questions that have actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:49.320" style="s2">worked in the past right these have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.580" end="00:19:51.390" style="s2">people have voted these the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.320" end="00:19:52.590" style="s2">enjoyable to participate in these ones</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.390" end="00:19:54.150" style="s2">have been the most productive and we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.590" end="00:19:55.590" style="s2">kind of see the crafting of a question</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.150" end="00:19:57.630" style="s2">and we might even be able to auto</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.590" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">auto-generate them to start with not to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.630" end="00:20:01.290" style="s2">start start but you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">once we have data just to do it to start</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.290" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">with and then the humans take it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">make it better to improve on it so how</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:08.700" style="s2">if you&#39;ll be able to submit questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:11.040" style="s2">and improve on questions and vote on</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.700" end="00:20:12.660" style="s2">them to say yes especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.040" end="00:20:15.720" style="s2">threshold in the beginning like for game</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.660" end="00:20:18.270" style="s2">B Tuesdays at 11:30 we&#39;re having one</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.720" end="00:20:19.620" style="s2">question rights and then the next week</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.270" end="00:20:20.700" style="s2">we have a question in the next week and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.620" end="00:20:22.260" style="s2">they might repeat because they might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.700" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">there&#39;s new people and we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.260" end="00:20:25.050" style="s2">the same like this week&#39;s one is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:28.370" style="s2">it&#39;s game be mean to you because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.050" end="00:20:30.809" style="s2">very easy one for game be people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.370" end="00:20:32.940" style="s2">anyone could answer it&#39;s there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.809" end="00:20:34.620" style="s2">right or wrong there&#39;s probably gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.940" end="00:20:35.970" style="s2">more niche ones that some people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.620" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">gonna want to talk about and some people</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.970" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t and so I&#39;m using that tool that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:43.920" style="s2">the meet the meeting tool that we had</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:45.750" style="s2">done in order to ask people like say</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.920" end="00:20:47.850" style="s2">what a question is that you want and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.750" end="00:20:49.890" style="s2">then have people vote on them but having</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.850" end="00:20:51.750" style="s2">that of course into the system so people</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.890" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">can easily generate especially during a</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.750" end="00:20:55.559" style="s2">question during a conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:59.160" style="s2">they can think of one inch and hey this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.559" end="00:21:01.050" style="s2">is a lead on to this and even with them</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.160" end="00:21:02.460" style="s2">metadata might be the wrong word but</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.050" end="00:21:04.050" style="s2">like hey in order to have this</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.460" end="00:21:05.970" style="s2">conversation you might have needed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.050" end="00:21:07.260" style="s2">have the previous conversation right it</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.970" end="00:21:08.820" style="s2">might need to build build on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.260" end="00:21:11.940" style="s2">previous one and the other ones will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.820" end="00:21:13.710" style="s2">one-off no you don&#39;t need to some might</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.940" end="00:21:16.830" style="s2">be experts right you need to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.710" end="00:21:18.929" style="s2">prove that you like this is more for</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.830" end="00:21:21.240" style="s2">meeting people&#39;s personal needs I want</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.929" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">to talk to other scientists in this area</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.240" end="00:21:25.860" style="s2">about this question right um I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:28.500" style="s2">very powerful I want to talk to other</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.860" end="00:21:30.300" style="s2">people who&#39;ve had this experience even</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.500" end="00:21:31.650" style="s2">if I haven&#39;t maybe I&#39;m thinking to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.300" end="00:21:33.030" style="s2">becoming a parent I want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.650" end="00:21:35.580" style="s2">other parents about their their</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.030" end="00:21:37.890" style="s2">questions as long as it&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.580" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">right that um I&#39;m not a parent but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.890" end="00:21:41.550" style="s2">want to talk to other parents and other</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:43.350" style="s2">people are willing to do that around me</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.550" end="00:21:45.210" style="s2">because that would be clearly a-- i have</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.350" end="00:21:47.309" style="s2">questions asked this is too many</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.210" end="00:21:51.690" style="s2">iterations of this thing but if these</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.309" end="00:21:54.690" style="s2">things are real and then after after</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.690" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">you&#39;ve had the conversation for the user</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.690" end="00:21:58.830" style="s2">to be able to rate the question right</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:01.980" style="s2">the both the question and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.830" end="00:22:04.170" style="s2">conversation and the people so how</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.980" end="00:22:07.290" style="s2">effective or enjoyable was that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.170" end="00:22:09.540" style="s2">conversation to talk about you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.290" end="00:22:11.490" style="s2">we&#39;re just giving feedback how was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.540" end="00:22:12.500" style="s2">time period how was talking for five</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.490" end="00:22:17.900" style="s2">minutes how</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.500" end="00:22:20.990" style="s2">the experience for you as well as how</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.900" end="00:22:22.490" style="s2">are the people right not so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:25.220" style="s2">kicking people out necessarily unless</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.490" end="00:22:26.270" style="s2">people are truly horrific and but so</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.220" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">that we can match them more with</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.270" end="00:22:30.170" style="s2">compatibility right you don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.150" style="s2">like people who interrupt you may we</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.170" end="00:22:34.160" style="s2">suggest the non interruption button</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.150" end="00:22:36.140" style="s2">right you seem to really like</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.160" end="00:22:38.210" style="s2">interrupting people maybe suggest the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.140" end="00:22:41.930" style="s2">interruption button right like having</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.210" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">that that piece that isn&#39;t excluded or</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.930" end="00:22:45.110" style="s2">including and it&#39;s saying how compatible</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">people at the table are and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.110" end="00:22:48.860" style="s2">be more likely to be maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:50.660" style="s2">beginning it&#39;s literally just vote up</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.860" end="00:22:51.860" style="s2">vote down where we cannot guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.660" end="00:22:52.790" style="s2">unless you block someone we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.860" end="00:22:54.770" style="s2">guarantee you&#39;re not gonna be at a table</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.790" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">with them but I enjoy talking to these</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.770" end="00:22:57.680" style="s2">people more than I enjoy talking to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:22:59.930" style="s2">these people and so it&#39;s more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.680" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">match me with people who you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.930" end="00:23:02.810" style="s2">starting like almost like circles like</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:24:00.170" style="s2">the tag clouds are shown in many</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.900" end="00:24:03.140" style="s2">WordPress sites how how hot each tag has</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.170" end="00:24:06.500" style="s2">been through time yeah and see like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.140" end="00:24:08.990" style="s2">questions generate the most participants</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.500" end="00:24:10.520" style="s2">what time periods for generate the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.990" end="00:24:14.600" style="s2">participants like having that data is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.520" end="00:24:16.160" style="s2">very very important so a tag link to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.600" end="00:24:20.450" style="s2">chronological timeline could be very</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.160" end="00:24:23.480" style="s2">interesting I know what that means but</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.450" end="00:24:26.300" style="s2">you probably do yeah I just if I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.480" end="00:24:28.100" style="s2">to to see every time</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.300" end="00:24:30.700" style="s2">I spoke then maybe there would be a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.100" end="00:24:33.320" style="s2">to be able to do that the kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.700" end="00:24:36.020" style="s2">video comments to take appearances at</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.320" end="00:24:37.550" style="s2">certain times ya know that kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.020" end="00:24:41.990" style="s2">I&#39;m doing here I guess tagging the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.550" end="00:24:43.880" style="s2">comments but that being said mostly this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.990" end="00:24:45.470" style="s2">isn&#39;t happening right we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.880" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">conversation someone happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.470" end="00:24:48.530" style="s2">watching so they can feel comfortable or</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:50.510" style="s2">they participate</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.530" end="00:24:53.180" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be interacting I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.510" end="00:24:54.740" style="s2">with the comment section but maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.180" end="00:24:57.080" style="s2">that is something people like and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.740" end="00:25:06.530" style="s2">like having someone you know offering</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.080" end="00:25:09.800" style="s2">offering things yeah yeah one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.530" end="00:25:13.670" style="s2">features that kind of thing is also you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.800" end="00:25:17.660" style="s2">know maybe we after the video we&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.670" end="00:25:19.250" style="s2">to have that kind of take away I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.660" end="00:25:20.780" style="s2">remember what you call it but it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.250" end="00:25:26.450" style="s2">where you&#39;re gathering that the nuggets</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.780" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">out of the out of the meeting do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.450" end="00:25:32.210" style="s2">mean more like the taking notes portion</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.550" style="s2">so that it can be like fed up or do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.210" end="00:25:36.500" style="s2">mean more like like this 30 seconds was</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.550" end="00:25:38.360" style="s2">being able to take off this 30 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.500" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">of video and share it well it&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.360" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">just kind of notes and textual stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.000" end="00:25:49.070" style="s2">yeah I can&#39;t I can&#39;t think that a video</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.520" end="00:25:51.110" style="s2">clip would actually provide enough value</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.070" end="00:25:55.400" style="s2">of the context so I think people have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.110" end="00:25:57.230" style="s2">rephrase it that would be something</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.400" end="00:26:00.290" style="s2">where if you&#39;re willing to be watched by</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.230" end="00:26:01.880" style="s2">people my guess is they&#39;re like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.290" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">like taking notes that&#39;s why I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.880" end="00:26:06.140" style="s2">taking notes I like taking notes on</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:07.940" style="s2">paper and then I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.140" end="00:26:10.160" style="s2">other people do and yet also I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.940" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">understand some a lot of times in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.160" end="00:26:16.010" style="s2">meeting nobody wants to take notes but</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:17.630" style="s2">somebody is willing to and to I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.010" end="00:26:19.100" style="s2">there can be medians for no one&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.630" end="00:26:20.300" style="s2">notes that&#39;s fine just know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.100" end="00:26:22.580" style="s2">not gonna happen if you&#39;re not taking</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.300" end="00:26:24.650" style="s2">notes and you&#39;re not no one is um you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.580" end="00:26:26.180" style="s2">not recording it there&#39;s no way it kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.650" end="00:26:27.890" style="s2">of harder to sit besides in the minds</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.180" end="00:26:31.310" style="s2">and hearts of the people moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.890" end="00:26:33.590" style="s2">and that&#39;s fine but then you can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.310" end="00:26:35.030" style="s2">back and and bring it out after right</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.590" end="00:26:36.380" style="s2">and you can you can feel like I was part</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.030" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">of this amazing conversation but you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.380" end="00:26:40.190" style="s2">can&#39;t not in the same way as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:41.809" style="s2">recorded and people are able the minute</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.190" end="00:26:44.570" style="s2">again people are able to like there</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.809" end="00:26:48.470" style="s2">could be participants like someone did</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.570" end="00:26:50.059" style="s2">kind of go through the communism Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.470" end="00:26:51.379" style="s2">ones and kind of say here&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.059" end="00:26:54.190" style="s2">each of you are saying I was like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.379" end="00:26:54.190" style="s2">really cool thank you</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.809" end="00:27:07.399" style="s2">they&#39;re cool like I did watch all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.669" end="00:27:10.549" style="s2">those by the way was interesting say</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.399" end="00:27:15.049" style="s2">that in October take Dunbar number was</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.549" end="00:27:18.110" style="s2">discussed twenty times yes a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.049" end="00:27:22.220" style="s2">mystics on whether that&#39;s I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.110" end="00:27:24.200" style="s2">how hard that is would be for like do we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.220" end="00:27:27.379" style="s2">need to record it for that to happen do</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.200" end="00:27:31.220" style="s2">we need it to I mean I yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.379" end="00:27:34.309" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be I guess so I did make a note</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:36.200" style="s2">that afterwards on the after features</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.309" end="00:27:38.330" style="s2">that we might want to then kind of tag</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.200" end="00:27:40.580" style="s2">if it&#39;s going to be recorded you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.330" end="00:27:47.629" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s going to be made</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.580" end="00:27:50.809" style="s2">public than tagging it actually I put it</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.629" end="00:27:52.429" style="s2">in there so then that could be something</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.809" end="00:27:56.539" style="s2">that then you can pull those statistics</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.429" end="00:27:57.860" style="s2">out of mm-hmm yeah I just like if AI</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.539" end="00:27:59.690" style="s2">could do it right if it was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.860" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">automatic if I say Dunbar number it just</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.690" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">takes it even though I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:04.879" style="s2">talking about Dunbar number I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:08.929" style="s2">using this example or something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.879" end="00:28:10.700" style="s2">could be tagged right and cuz I said it</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.929" end="00:28:12.440" style="s2">somebody like actually it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.700" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">like one out of five stars relevant</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.440" end="00:28:16.730" style="s2">right versus something awe-inspiring Lee</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:18.860" style="s2">knew that I should not be a scholar on</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.730" end="00:28:20.330" style="s2">the Dunbar number is like Wow five stars</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.860" end="00:28:20.840" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant you know I can like</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.330" end="00:28:23.539" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.840" end="00:28:28.389" style="s2">pull them automated automated transcript</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.539" end="00:28:32.980" style="s2">sir are beginning to be rather accurate</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.389" end="00:28:32.980" style="s2">so yeah I could definitely be a thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.610" end="00:28:39.669" style="s2">because if it&#39;s able to subtitle in real</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.350" end="00:28:43.549" style="s2">time that would be amazing because</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.669" end="00:28:46.429" style="s2">wanted it adds to the language like</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.549" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">people who can&#39;t who who English is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.429" end="00:28:50.149" style="s2">their second language having subtitles</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:53.779" style="s2">is huge being hard of hearing subtitles</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.149" end="00:28:55.399" style="s2">are huge for basically anything just</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.779" end="00:28:58.700" style="s2">helps you translate it it helps you do</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.399" end="00:29:00.769" style="s2">to help the metadata it&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.700" end="00:29:02.059" style="s2">that I find really like I don&#39;t subtitle</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.769" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">my videos even though I really wish they</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.059" end="00:29:05.719" style="s2">were subtitled like I want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:07.639" style="s2">but it takes a lot of time and effort</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.719" end="00:29:08.929" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t a way like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.639" end="00:29:09.979" style="s2">watching a YouTube video and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.929" end="00:29:11.539" style="s2">subtitle is off</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.979" end="00:29:13.399" style="s2">I&#39;m like why can&#39;t I just correct it</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.539" end="00:29:14.809" style="s2">like why can&#39;t I just be like without</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.399" end="00:29:18.019" style="s2">having to go in and do this whole big</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.809" end="00:29:19.549" style="s2">meta thing it should be as easy as ok I</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.019" end="00:29:21.320" style="s2">corrected it and if you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.549" end="00:29:22.879" style="s2">avi correct it and I&#39;m a troll and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.320" end="00:29:24.440" style="s2">corrected a horrible way that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.879" end="00:29:27.379" style="s2">even if three people correct it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.440" end="00:29:30.700" style="s2">good right that like that becomes the to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.379" end="00:29:31.999" style="s2">make it easier easier for people to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.700" end="00:29:35.089" style="s2">that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.999" end="00:29:37.580" style="s2">for people to optionally check well</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.089" end="00:29:39.469" style="s2">there is its original conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.580" end="00:29:43.729" style="s2">concept would be to create incremental</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.469" end="00:29:45.019" style="s2">self-correcting conversations I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.729" end="00:29:47.089" style="s2">there was a one before that that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.019" end="00:29:48.919" style="s2">missing imagine if you could go back to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.089" end="00:29:50.809" style="s2">video conversations and insert your own</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.919" end="00:29:52.669" style="s2">video comments that&#39;s also cool because</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.809" end="00:29:55.129" style="s2">when I&#39;m rewatching myself a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.669" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">times I&#39;ll be like because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.129" end="00:30:00.289" style="s2">say 15 things at once and then I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">oh I didn&#39;t even get to the point and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.289" end="00:30:04.369" style="s2">to be able to go in and put that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:06.469" style="s2">be would be amazing and so what Jim rat</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.369" end="00:30:07.759" style="s2">does that with his shows easy goes back</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.469" end="00:30:09.320" style="s2">and puts comments and you see that in</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.759" end="00:30:10.789" style="s2">YouTube videos if people being like</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.320" end="00:30:15.320" style="s2">actually I had that information wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.789" end="00:30:16.909" style="s2">here it is right um it&#39;s it&#39;s less about</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.320" end="00:30:18.469" style="s2">disseminating information and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.909" end="00:30:20.929" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t almost matter if it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.469" end="00:30:22.219" style="s2">but to be able to go in and maybe tag</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.929" end="00:30:24.529" style="s2">hey and then I talked about this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.219" end="00:30:26.359" style="s2">other time or hey I reference this</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.529" end="00:30:29.869" style="s2">conversation here&#39;s the tag to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.359" end="00:30:31.879" style="s2">conversation but the point isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.869" end="00:30:34.460" style="s2">necessarily to make YouTube that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.879" end="00:30:38.929" style="s2">interactive it&#39;s to make an experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.460" end="00:30:41.330" style="s2">for the person that is changing them and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.929" end="00:30:43.219" style="s2">like for the individual be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.330" end="00:30:45.289" style="s2">participate in a meaningful intimate</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.219" end="00:30:46.940" style="s2">conversation and then all of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.289" end="00:30:48.499" style="s2">information we can get out of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.940" end="00:30:50.779" style="s2">let&#39;s get that information out because</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.499" end="00:30:53.089" style="s2">it helps us make the system better it</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.779" end="00:30:55.249" style="s2">helps us make some of us are just data</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.089" end="00:30:55.399" style="s2">geeks and we like that kind of thing you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.249" end="00:30:57.139" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.399" end="00:30:58.820" style="s2">like it&#39;s just a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.139" end="00:31:01.249" style="s2">information and as long as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.820" end="00:31:02.839" style="s2">transparent about it about about it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.249" end="00:31:07.220" style="s2">there&#39;s an option to opt-in and opt-out</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.839" end="00:31:10.070" style="s2">I think the more data the better yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.220" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">think that&#39;s great I yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.070" end="00:31:13.669" style="s2">getting a bit far afield from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:16.549" style="s2">original our goal is really that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.669" end="00:31:19.309" style="s2">experience and and the after stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.549" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">all kind of bonus and that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.309" end="00:31:22.970" style="s2">getting really kind of complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:27.110" style="s2">afterwards stuff I do like the idea in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.970" end="00:31:29.780" style="s2">general of being able to take splice</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.110" end="00:31:30.770" style="s2">videos and splice in other comments and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:36.020" style="s2">stuff that would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.770" end="00:31:37.940" style="s2">project in and of itself yeah so what</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.020" end="00:31:41.510" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing here is that especially for</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.940" end="00:31:43.370" style="s2">like the scheduling is that an estimate</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.510" end="00:31:45.980" style="s2">syntax I think most of the stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.370" end="00:31:49.820" style="s2">your your needs and your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.980" end="00:31:52.520" style="s2">preferences all of that could be started</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.820" end="00:31:54.049" style="s2">with as a tagging system and then as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.520" end="00:31:59.900" style="s2">add a tag you could designate it as</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.049" end="00:32:04.400" style="s2">being required or you know just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.900" end="00:32:06.470" style="s2">preference so I think you&#39;d get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.400" end="00:32:08.090" style="s2">the features in with that kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.470" end="00:32:11.299" style="s2">feature and then of course the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.090" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">scheduling being able to put your</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.299" end="00:32:17.570" style="s2">calendar in there and then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:18.919" style="s2">figure out notifications you mean like</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.570" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">literally upload by Kelly because I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.919" end="00:32:21.559" style="s2">to be we need to be able to do both</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:23.090" style="s2">things I don&#39;t have a calendar of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.559" end="00:32:24.620" style="s2">paper copy that isn&#39;t gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.090" end="00:32:27.860" style="s2">be uploaded but I can put in my schedule</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.620" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">right I&#39;m available 9:30 to 2:30 when my</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.860" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">kids in school more or less unless I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:33.620" style="s2">going grocery shopping and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:36.860" style="s2">and that sorry that was also something</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.620" end="00:32:38.900" style="s2">um as well as the preference of how long</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.860" end="00:32:40.940" style="s2">like that I want to be scheduled I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.900" end="00:32:46.130" style="s2">to be told there&#39;s a conversation 24</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.940" end="00:32:48.530" style="s2">hours in advance or right away is is my</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.130" end="00:32:50.929" style="s2">schedule constant mine is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.530" end="00:32:52.309" style="s2">constant other people&#39;s isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.929" end="00:32:54.409" style="s2">they&#39;re on shift work so they literally</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.309" end="00:32:56.390" style="s2">need their their google calendar to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.409" end="00:32:58.700" style="s2">uploaded to be like I&#39;m working I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.390" end="00:33:00.110" style="s2">available but on these time periods they</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.700" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">are and easier we make it for them</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.110" end="00:33:02.870" style="s2">better so if they are able to just</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:08.510" style="s2">upload their calendar that would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.870" end="00:33:10.789" style="s2">amazing continually and also have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.510" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">feature this happens on dating sites</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.789" end="00:33:14.570" style="s2">especially paid dating sites where</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:15.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a ton of people who have their</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.570" end="00:33:18.950" style="s2">information in there but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.740" end="00:33:20.299" style="s2">active right so a certain amount of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.950" end="00:33:21.230" style="s2">okay you haven&#39;t had a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.299" end="00:33:23.539" style="s2">among</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.230" end="00:33:25.010" style="s2">so we&#39;re assuming you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.539" end="00:33:26.450" style="s2">available for a conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.010" end="00:33:28.220" style="s2">know if that&#39;s even needed because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.450" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">literally like asking you hey do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.220" end="00:33:31.309" style="s2">want to have this conversation in your</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:32.870" style="s2">pinging back and as long as you keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.309" end="00:33:36.710" style="s2">getting those and you want them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.870" end="00:33:38.510" style="s2">not unsubscribing that&#39;s fine but there</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.710" end="00:33:41.299" style="s2">might be a reason to have that right to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.510" end="00:33:43.250" style="s2">be like yeah I mean if costs start in an</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.299" end="00:33:45.380" style="s2">or having to pay for that communication</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.250" end="00:33:46.730" style="s2">that notification and then yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.380" end="00:33:47.510" style="s2">might be something we look into you</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.730" end="00:33:49.730" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.510" end="00:33:51.260" style="s2">yeah I know a dating sites you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.730" end="00:33:53.090" style="s2">oh look at all these people but no</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.260" end="00:33:55.010" style="s2">because most of them aren&#39;t on here they</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.090" end="00:33:56.929" style="s2">signed up then it was paid communication</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.010" end="00:33:59.210" style="s2">and everyone dropped out so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.929" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">maybe one tenth of the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.210" end="00:34:04.730" style="s2">on there right so it hurts the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:07.639" style="s2">experience of the person who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.730" end="00:34:10.099" style="s2">trying to use your service and might pay</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.639" end="00:34:12.409" style="s2">for it if it didn&#39;t have all of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.099" end="00:34:14.599" style="s2">overinflated community I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.409" end="00:34:17.300" style="s2">that&#39;s the same for us because again</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.599" end="00:34:18.740" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re maybe you you do want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.300" end="00:34:20.089" style="s2">pick a topic there&#39;s a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.740" end="00:34:20.679" style="s2">in and all the people that are in there</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.089" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.679" end="00:34:27.409" style="s2">exit exited but aren&#39;t available right</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:29.540" style="s2">now but I think that this is a different</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.409" end="00:34:31.339" style="s2">system and since we&#39;re creating it for</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.540" end="00:34:33.050" style="s2">purpose a non-profit we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.339" end="00:34:35.270" style="s2">incentive to over inflate our numbers</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.050" end="00:34:37.010" style="s2">right or not yeah look at us we have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.270" end="00:34:40.339" style="s2">million people having conversations when</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.010" end="00:34:45.500" style="s2">it&#39;s really a few hundred having actual</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.339" end="00:34:48.440" style="s2">conversations yeah there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.500" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">tempted temptation to do that even if</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.440" end="00:34:51.490" style="s2">you&#39;re not for profit just because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:53.389" style="s2">want because people do like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.490" end="00:34:54.710" style="s2">participating something was something</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.389" end="00:34:57.859" style="s2">that a lot of people are already</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.710" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">participating in but as long as we can I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.859" end="00:35:02.690" style="s2">think it&#39;s better in that case to appeal</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:05.030" style="s2">to the early adopters but it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.690" end="00:35:07.099" style="s2">it&#39;s tempting to exaggerate your numbers</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.030" end="00:35:09.140" style="s2">yeah I mean can be a transparent about</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.099" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">like hey a million people have signed up</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.140" end="00:35:14.450" style="s2">right like just use the language that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:16.010" style="s2">real like a million people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.450" end="00:35:19.190" style="s2">logging on every day but they&#39;re signed</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.010" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">up and potentially you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.190" end="00:35:22.369" style="s2">many people interested in that topic</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:25.099" style="s2">like to be able to have more access to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.369" end="00:35:26.329" style="s2">data because it&#39;s our platform so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.099" end="00:35:27.550" style="s2">like what makes it better for you if</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.329" end="00:35:30.610" style="s2">you&#39;re like I&#39;m not using it because</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.550" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">there&#39;s only a hundred people on there</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.610" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">I personally have no problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:36.370" style="s2">I&#39;m like as long as I matched up with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.420" end="00:35:40.120" style="s2">few people I care about the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.370" end="00:35:41.950" style="s2">not the bigger one like I don&#39;t care a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.120" end="00:35:43.720" style="s2">Twitter would be awesome if it was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.950" end="00:35:44.350" style="s2">game be people right like I&#39;d be okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.720" end="00:35:46.150" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.350" end="00:35:47.740" style="s2">like its I don&#39;t need there to be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.150" end="00:35:49.420" style="s2">millions of people and Donald Trump to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.740" end="00:35:50.980" style="s2">be on there and like I don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.420" end="00:35:53.140" style="s2">people with millions of followers but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.980" end="00:35:54.910" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m unique in that I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.140" end="00:35:57.790" style="s2">also creating something unique where</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.910" end="00:36:00.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like this isn&#39;t a fly-by-night</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.790" end="00:36:01.180" style="s2">platform this isn&#39;t the new social media</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.100" end="00:36:03.670" style="s2">that everyone&#39;s gonna jump on board and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.180" end="00:36:06.370" style="s2">then jump off of maybe it is but like</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.670" end="00:36:08.290" style="s2">the idea is what would make you stay</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.370" end="00:36:10.030" style="s2">what makes it enjoyable how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.290" end="00:36:11.740" style="s2">continually improve it because it&#39;s ours</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.030" end="00:36:14.290" style="s2">we need a way to have a video</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.740" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">conversation if it&#39;s too combative and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.290" end="00:36:19.000" style="s2">there&#39;s too many trolls what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:20.470" style="s2">how do we stop that if it&#39;s to anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.000" end="00:36:22.450" style="s2">that goes wrong how do we fix it</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.470" end="00:36:31.450" style="s2">together how do we make the next one</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.450" end="00:36:36.490" style="s2">better yep yeah so I guess next steps</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.450" end="00:36:38.680" style="s2">would be to kind of prioritize these and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.490" end="00:36:40.540" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s our minimum set now I</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.680" end="00:36:43.390" style="s2">guess we already have a minimum set</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.540" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">cause we&#39;re already doing it right you</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.390" end="00:36:47.670" style="s2">know so YouTube channel is the minimum</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:53.380" style="s2">set yeah I guess what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.670" end="00:36:55.510" style="s2">valuable piece I think that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.380" end="00:36:58.990" style="s2">kind of put in your calendar and say</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.510" end="00:37:00.850" style="s2">when you&#39;re available even more so than</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.990" end="00:37:06.250" style="s2">the topics and the descriptions and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.850" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">needs and stuff and then have it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.250" end="00:37:17.170" style="s2">this this matching up of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">available time to meet yes yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.170" end="00:37:21.940" style="s2">also I&#39;m sterna practice a mega rule</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:26.830" style="s2">because my brains going into the next</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.940" end="00:37:28.690" style="s2">conversation and not listening um how do</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.830" end="00:37:31.900" style="s2">we want the first tool to work right is</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.690" end="00:37:33.970" style="s2">it - what&#39;s the word like back up the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.900" end="00:37:37.480" style="s2">YouTube channel or is it to create</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.970" end="00:37:39.640" style="s2">assume style conversation right and my</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.480" end="00:37:40.840" style="s2">guess is it&#39;s a zoom style conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.640" end="00:37:43.420" style="s2">YouTube&#39;s more about bringing people</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.840" end="00:37:44.470" style="s2">into the zoom style conversation most</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.420" end="00:37:45.609" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.470" end="00:37:48.430" style="s2">aren&#39;t comfortable having their</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.609" end="00:37:50.109" style="s2">conversation broadcasts that&#39;s a piece</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.430" end="00:37:53.170" style="s2">of what I&#39;m now offering people in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.109" end="00:37:55.390" style="s2">idea cafe is afterwards the idea is with</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.170" end="00:37:58.750" style="s2">a game be one we&#39;re gonna record it</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.390" end="00:38:00.579" style="s2">unlisted so that people can watch who</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.750" end="00:38:03.099" style="s2">aren&#39;t participating but from game be</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.579" end="00:38:04.270" style="s2">write the if you got the link to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.099" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">participation you weren&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.270" end="00:38:07.450" style="s2">participate you can watch basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:08.770" style="s2">right it&#39;s not open to everyone but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.450" end="00:38:10.750" style="s2">open to people who would have</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.770" end="00:38:12.700" style="s2">participated and then afterwards the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.750" end="00:38:15.099" style="s2">people who participated get to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.700" end="00:38:19.589" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s deleted right</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.099" end="00:38:22.150" style="s2">deleted private unlisted or public I</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.589" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">think that is a good feature to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.150" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">also in the one write that like maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:26.950" style="s2">recorded it and then afterwards we want</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:29.050" style="s2">to delete it but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.950" end="00:38:30.310" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re having um like add</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.050" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">new features the thing we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.310" end="00:38:36.339" style="s2">prioritized yet that to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:38.260" style="s2">people come on board and have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.339" end="00:38:41.079" style="s2">conversation either for together attack</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.260" end="00:38:43.750" style="s2">our thing or game be the bigger thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.079" end="00:38:49.270" style="s2">right um or which one fits in which one</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.750" end="00:38:51.550" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to say but to find um like</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.270" end="00:38:54.420" style="s2">what is needed and that&#39;s part of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.550" end="00:38:57.160" style="s2">having the idea cafes on with game be</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.420" end="00:38:58.599" style="s2">how how does this work how doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.160" end="00:39:00.970" style="s2">worked in order to know some of those</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.599" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">like I think it would be the big piece</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.970" end="00:39:05.740" style="s2">you&#39;re right is the scheduler like</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:07.540" style="s2">getting people to a conversation whether</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.740" end="00:39:10.510" style="s2">it&#39;s on YouTube or not there&#39;s benefits</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.540" end="00:39:11.650" style="s2">and costs to having it on YouTube right</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.510" end="00:39:13.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.650" end="00:39:15.490" style="s2">to participate because it&#39;s on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.180" end="00:39:18.339" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to be visible to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.490" end="00:39:22.150" style="s2">world even if it can be good and even</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.339" end="00:39:23.859" style="s2">for v1 it may be with the scheduler it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.150" end="00:39:26.470" style="s2">may be like oh we&#39;ve picked a time for</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.859" end="00:39:29.859" style="s2">you someone else needs to get a free</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.470" end="00:39:32.109" style="s2">account at zoom and and set it up and if</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.859" end="00:39:34.390" style="s2">someone records it then you either stay</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.109" end="00:39:36.190" style="s2">on and you leave in you and you allow</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.390" end="00:39:37.810" style="s2">them to record it because you know we</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.190" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">can all agree whether it&#39;ll be deleted</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.810" end="00:39:41.230" style="s2">or not but there&#39;s no way for us to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.040" end="00:39:42.910" style="s2">enforce it at this point yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.230" end="00:39:45.609" style="s2">important so there&#39;s four terms and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.910" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">conditions yeah and we could yeah and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.609" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">could definitely make a terms and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.440" style="s2">conditions kind of video but it would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">it would be up to them to either watch</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.440" end="00:39:57.579" style="s2">that I mean if depending on let me let</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:57.880" style="s2">me take a step back so what I&#39;m first</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.579" end="00:40:00.070" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.880" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">look for technologies that already</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.070" end="00:40:04.390" style="s2">exists that meet that kind of minimum</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:05.860" style="s2">set of needs see if there is some sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.390" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">of scheduling system out there we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.860" end="00:40:12.520" style="s2">use what are its gaps before we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:15.730" style="s2">dive in and start creating something and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.520" end="00:40:18.190" style="s2">so depending on that it will have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.730" end="00:40:21.790" style="s2">just decide did that become maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.190" end="00:40:25.930" style="s2">discussion for next meeting is was I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.790" end="00:40:27.430" style="s2">able to find time to find anything and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.930" end="00:40:28.870" style="s2">then and then yeah we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.430" end="00:40:31.240" style="s2">where those features are whether we do</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.870" end="00:40:33.250" style="s2">need to build something this track to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.240" end="00:40:34.930" style="s2">this know which is a good I mean I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.250" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">the person to do that I&#39;m not like even</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.930" end="00:40:39.940" style="s2">doodle I&#39;m like why why it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:42.940" style="s2">coordinator but like it&#39;s like doodle</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.940" end="00:40:44.740" style="s2">meets Google calendars meets this and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.940" end="00:40:47.830" style="s2">that thing might already exist and also</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.740" end="00:40:50.170" style="s2">it might be pieces from little pieces</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.830" end="00:40:51.190" style="s2">from different ones that we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.170" end="00:40:54.520" style="s2">create cuz it&#39;s hard to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.190" end="00:40:57.010" style="s2">pieces from from other things but if it</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.520" end="00:40:59.590" style="s2">if it performs 80% of the task like</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.010" end="00:41:02.290" style="s2">honestly having the document and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.590" end="00:41:03.910" style="s2">spreadsheet does a lot of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.290" end="00:41:05.740" style="s2">I was like I can&#39;t email all of you</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.910" end="00:41:07.870" style="s2">individually and like what happened with</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.870" end="00:41:10.570" style="s2">this is hard to coordinate and people</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.220" end="00:41:13.900" style="s2">don&#39;t show up and people though and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.570" end="00:41:15.370" style="s2">like oh I&#39;m just going to let go of</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.680" style="s2">could open more time slots but I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.240" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to open more time slots I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.920" end="00:42:18.190" style="s2">that I&#39;ve done like the 80% I guess like</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.980" end="00:42:20.260" style="s2">this spreadsheet and the document feels</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.190" end="00:42:23.730" style="s2">my needs for the 80 percents that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.260" end="00:42:23.730" style="s2">not doing it doing all of this work but</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.029" end="00:42:31.539" style="s2">semester so that I&#39;ll put up our</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.980" end="00:42:32.769" style="s2">nestling and I want to interrupt a quick</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.539" end="00:42:35.859" style="s2">observation that fix the world Friday</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.769" end="00:42:37.089" style="s2">show seems based on we got a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.859" end="00:42:42.490" style="s2">left to fix the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.089" end="00:42:44.650" style="s2">I take lesson is that on that yeah no it</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.490" end="00:42:49.240" style="s2">does and also we don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:51.400" style="s2">time but we also do if we can like what</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.240" end="00:42:54.460" style="s2">I propose that we fix the world with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.400" end="00:42:56.440" style="s2">global tech cooperative once we have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.460" end="00:42:58.329" style="s2">way to have a conversation once we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.440" end="00:43:03.430" style="s2">a handful of tools like the scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.329" end="00:43:05.230" style="s2">like a group coordination and we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.430" end="00:43:07.809" style="s2">unleash humanity on humanity&#39;s problems</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.230" end="00:43:09.910" style="s2">everything gets fixed so rapidly but</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.809" end="00:43:11.619" style="s2">this is the snowball starting like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.910" end="00:43:13.869" style="s2">is the slow part and it feels like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.619" end="00:43:15.039" style="s2">not moving fast enough but everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.869" end="00:43:17.410" style="s2">willing to come on board and move us</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.039" end="00:43:19.990" style="s2">faster right no you don&#39;t get to move</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.410" end="00:43:21.910" style="s2">Jubilee and Bentley faster because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.990" end="00:43:23.769" style="s2">autonomous human beings who gets it like</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.910" end="00:43:25.630" style="s2">have our own schedule but if someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.769" end="00:43:27.910" style="s2">else has a way right of like hey I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.630" end="00:43:32.140" style="s2">build that this weekend go for it right</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.910" end="00:43:35.589" style="s2">like why not why not and if you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.140" end="00:43:37.569" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the idea is Ernesto had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.589" end="00:43:42.190" style="s2">comment even before joining cells</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.569" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">content so to assemble a synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.190" end="00:43:46.089" style="s2">conversations almost like video letters</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:47.650" style="s2">where people take turns to assemble a</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.089" end="00:43:51.279" style="s2">conversation exploring a certain subject</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.650" end="00:43:53.079" style="s2">would be great I thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.279" end="00:43:55.509" style="s2">because since we are doing things kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.079" end="00:43:58.180" style="s2">of online we have the opportunity where</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.509" end="00:44:02.349" style="s2">people aren&#39;t actually all doing this at</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.180" end="00:44:04.450" style="s2">the same time but I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.349" end="00:44:06.700" style="s2">a slightly different concept than what</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.450" end="00:44:08.410" style="s2">do you what you&#39;ve been kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.700" end="00:44:11.859" style="s2">of because you you want that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.410" end="00:44:15.700" style="s2">immediate feedback from the audience but</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.859" end="00:44:18.519" style="s2">I think I think that that&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.700" end="00:44:19.630" style="s2">consider in the future is and and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.519" end="00:44:23.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you all have seen the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.630" end="00:44:24.730" style="s2">letters project where the they have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.289" end="00:44:25.780" style="s2">website where you&#39;re supposed to write</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.730" end="00:44:27.250" style="s2">to people</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.780" end="00:44:30.910" style="s2">to have a conversation they write a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.250" end="00:44:33.010" style="s2">long-form letter back and forth about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.910" end="00:44:35.530" style="s2">so it&#39;d be similar to that but in in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.010" end="00:44:37.600" style="s2">video form it sounds like what Arness</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.530" end="00:44:38.830" style="s2">does this is also I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.600" end="00:44:40.210" style="s2">guys are familiar I don&#39;t remember the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.830" end="00:44:41.530" style="s2">person who literally have any</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.210" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">conversation with him once have some</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.530" end="00:44:44.740" style="s2">time because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s names on</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:47.860" style="s2">there but the glass speed conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.740" end="00:44:49.720" style="s2">and they are creating an app for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.860" end="00:44:51.640" style="s2">and it started video but it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.720" end="00:44:53.560" style="s2">idea is you have two people they can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.640" end="00:44:54.550" style="s2">up to four and you&#39;re going back and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.560" end="00:44:56.680" style="s2">forth for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.550" end="00:44:58.420" style="s2">so it&#39;s like I take a minute you take a</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.680" end="00:45:00.130" style="s2">minute and then it&#39;s up to ten rounds so</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.420" end="00:45:02.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a 10-minute conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.130" end="00:45:03.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s this concentrated time</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.380" end="00:45:04.750" style="s2">you&#39;re not bringing ego it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.670" end="00:45:06.970" style="s2">theoretically you&#39;re not bring an ego</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.750" end="00:45:09.430" style="s2">into it or a lot of I or filler language</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.970" end="00:45:12.730" style="s2">like well I think that in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.430" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re like just focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.730" end="00:45:17.110" style="s2">thing that it is it&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.330" style="s2">experience to be part of and it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.110" end="00:45:22.120" style="s2">leads this this cool conversation at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.330" end="00:45:24.790" style="s2">end but yeah that&#39;s not quite what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.120" end="00:45:26.170" style="s2">making we&#39;re making the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.790" end="00:45:28.180" style="s2">current social media where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.170" end="00:45:29.560" style="s2">this disconnection screaming across the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.180" end="00:45:32.020" style="s2">void it&#39;s like how do you bring people</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.560" end="00:45:34.810" style="s2">together and have them see each other as</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.020" end="00:45:36.130" style="s2">humans see the humanity even when we</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.810" end="00:45:37.780" style="s2">can&#39;t because I don&#39;t like you right</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.130" end="00:45:38.890" style="s2">like that it&#39;s like well we&#39;ll keep you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.780" end="00:45:42.130" style="s2">apart but you can see the humanity</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.890" end="00:45:45.160" style="s2">everybody else like how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.130" end="00:45:46.750" style="s2">have an enjoyable conversation and how</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.160" end="00:45:49.930" style="s2">do we make it effective so we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.750" end="00:45:52.030" style="s2">eventually get other tech out of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.930" end="00:45:53.800" style="s2">other stuff that is projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.030" end="00:45:55.240" style="s2">that are world-changing and fixing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.800" end="00:45:59.190" style="s2">worlds all at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.240" end="00:46:03.430" style="s2">and six world brightest is my thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.190" end="00:46:05.980" style="s2">ernesto says if your evil has a cure why</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.430" end="00:46:08.410" style="s2">hurry if it does not why why hurry</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.980" end="00:46:12.790" style="s2">I think he&#39;s responding to going south</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.410" end="00:46:14.440" style="s2">yeah no I absolutely is the young but</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.790" end="00:46:16.180" style="s2">you it&#39;s like I have a sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.440" end="00:46:19.060" style="s2">and at the same time my sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.180" end="00:46:21.490" style="s2">has calmed now that we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.060" end="00:46:22.870" style="s2">together and it&#39;s not just me it&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.490" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s like okay I feel like I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.870" end="00:46:26.080" style="s2">doing it for so long just talking out</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">into the void hoping someone thought it</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.080" end="00:46:32.740" style="s2">was like yes I see the beauty let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">create this we&#39;re only in a few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.740" end="00:46:35.470" style="s2">but I guarantee you there&#39;s other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:37.360" style="s2">who will come on board and fill in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.470" end="00:46:40.260" style="s2">pieces were not able to fill in easily</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.360" end="00:46:40.260" style="s2">ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:44.650" style="s2">it does get to a point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.369" end="00:46:47.079" style="s2">snowballs and it&#39;s huge and everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.650" end="00:46:48.760" style="s2">happens rather rather rapidly when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.079" end="00:46:51.220" style="s2">designed to do it that way and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.760" end="00:46:52.690" style="s2">keeping that in mind and yet no one gets</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.220" end="00:46:55.180" style="s2">to decide somebody else has to move</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.690" end="00:46:59.319" style="s2">rapidly right like the thing can move</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.180" end="00:47:01.540" style="s2">rapidly we don&#39;t need to and I also just</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.319" end="00:47:09.700" style="s2">had a thought on kind of starting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.540" end="00:47:14.410" style="s2">build a list of participants did the did</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.700" end="00:47:16.690" style="s2">the WordPress website is that up yet I</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.410" end="00:47:18.309" style="s2">know the person who&#39;s doing it had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.690" end="00:47:19.660" style="s2">sick kid and then she was sick but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.309" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">supposed to be up in the next couple of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.660" end="00:47:22.869" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:24.849" style="s2">she&#39;s like learning WordPress while</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.869" end="00:47:26.829" style="s2">she&#39;s doing it oh you sites and stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.849" end="00:47:28.900" style="s2">like she&#39;s enjoying the learning of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.829" end="00:47:30.730" style="s2">so that kind of that was again I have</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.900" end="00:47:32.680" style="s2">zero experience in creating WordPress I</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.730" end="00:47:34.150" style="s2">could barely do a blog on their site so</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.680" end="00:47:36.040" style="s2">I needed someone to step in and do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.150" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">um it is up a little bit if you go to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.040" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">together tech not with an aged Tec Tec</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.130" end="00:47:44.680" style="s2">22 CH dot org then you can see a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:46.180" style="s2">it there&#39;s a few things she has to fix</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.680" end="00:47:49.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s like I have to move the blog</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.180" end="00:47:51.099" style="s2">the actual blog over from I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.720" end="00:47:52.450" style="s2">move all of it over but the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.099" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">are pertinent to the actual together</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.450" end="00:47:56.680" style="s2">tech it wasn&#39;t just my filler because I</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.450" style="s2">wanted to do one a week for a few months</p>

<p begin="00:49:56.890" end="00:50:00.730" style="s2">wanted her to include like what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.049" end="00:50:03.160" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do with Wix which I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.730" end="00:50:04.690" style="s2">do with WordPress is actually help</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.160" end="00:50:07.569" style="s2">people sign up that being said together</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.690" end="00:50:09.670" style="s2">Tech org is about together tech right I</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.569" end="00:50:10.990" style="s2">don&#39;t even think it mentions idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.670" end="00:50:13.299" style="s2">because it was done long before I kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.990" end="00:50:15.339" style="s2">of had the idea for the a cafe and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.299" end="00:50:17.140" style="s2">adding another page or adding something</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.339" end="00:50:18.700" style="s2">that is directly a part of that or a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.140" end="00:50:21.759" style="s2">page or maybe it&#39;s a separate one that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.700" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve been linked to so yeah we do a one</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.759" end="00:50:26.980" style="s2">page landing page that&#39;s free like free</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.920" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">to host somewhere that is because of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.980" end="00:50:32.130" style="s2">technical skills I do free hosting on</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:36.700" style="s2">github for small open source projects</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.130" end="00:50:38.410" style="s2">which this equals but you do have to buy</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.700" end="00:50:40.809" style="s2">a domain unless you want it under</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.410" end="00:50:43.299" style="s2">something else and I was thinking just</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.809" end="00:50:44.529" style="s2">as a starter I mean we could put a lei I</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.299" end="00:50:46.390" style="s2">could put a landing page on Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.529" end="00:50:48.819" style="s2">Davis calm or we could put on together</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.390" end="00:50:50.109" style="s2">tech dot or just just to have some place</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.819" end="00:50:52.150" style="s2">to go because I don&#39;t think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.109" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">like buy a domain and put it out there</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.150" end="00:50:58.390" style="s2">unless we think it&#39;s we&#39;re at that point</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.930" style="s2">and someone wants to pay the $79 or</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.390" end="00:51:00.730" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.930" end="00:51:02.710" style="s2">I already did that with the other second</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.730" end="00:51:04.150" style="s2">September to do this one I&#39;m like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.710" end="00:51:05.799" style="s2">was a big step for me I&#39;m like I put</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.150" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">money because they up and put so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.799" end="00:51:08.260" style="s2">time and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:11.380" style="s2">but I want to make sure that like</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.260" end="00:51:12.730" style="s2">there&#39;s the threshold of people who want</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.380" end="00:51:14.410" style="s2">to do what I want to risk luck I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.730" end="00:51:16.600" style="s2">have money to risk but it was also like</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.410" end="00:51:18.700" style="s2">you know under 50 bucks let me do it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.600" end="00:51:25.600" style="s2">that&#39;s why yeah for ideas at this stage</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.700" end="00:51:27.160" style="s2">I generally suggest suggest that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.600" end="00:51:29.890" style="s2">just with that we just put it on</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.160" end="00:51:31.780" style="s2">something else and even both because we</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.890" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">could link to the same email list from</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.780" end="00:51:37.780" style="s2">like my website and from or I come to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:40.300" style="s2">think of it if you if we get a free</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.780" end="00:51:41.650" style="s2">MailChimp account or if she&#39;s I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.650" end="00:51:46.870" style="s2">what are you thinking about okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.830" end="00:51:48.520" style="s2">then we could also just get a link and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.870" end="00:51:50.110" style="s2">we can tweet it you don&#39;t even really</p>

<p begin="00:51:52.900" end="00:51:56.590" style="s2">concise that will fit in a tweet with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.280" end="00:51:59.710" style="s2">link so we don&#39;t even really need a</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.590" end="00:52:04.420" style="s2">landing page but it might be good to set</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.440" end="00:54:44.200" style="s2">being able to create the tools that help</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.300" end="00:54:46.820" style="s2">people find their space in the solution</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.200" end="00:54:48.560" style="s2">offered is the solution like it</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.820" end="00:54:50.450" style="s2">literally is like then you&#39;re tapping</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.560" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">into a fraction of human potential it</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.450" end="00:54:54.890" style="s2">rapidly snowballs and everyone solves</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:54:57.110" style="s2">everything especially when you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.890" end="00:54:58.760" style="s2">owning that it&#39;s not perfect right that</p>

<p begin="00:55:01.550" end="00:55:06.320" style="s2">place why isn&#39;t it right if it&#39;s just as</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.070" end="00:55:08.900" style="s2">simple as adding a new tool let&#39;s add it</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.320" end="00:55:11.060" style="s2">if it&#39;s we&#39;re fundamentally opposed cuz</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.900" end="00:55:13.460" style="s2">you want to create an oil company and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.060" end="00:55:15.860" style="s2">make billions of dollars this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.460" end="00:55:20.440" style="s2">place for you right like this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.860" end="00:55:23.210" style="s2">voluntary how we cooperate in creating a</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.440" end="00:55:25.160" style="s2">solution to all of the world&#39;s problems</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.210" end="00:55:26.930" style="s2">which are all interconnected and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.160" end="00:55:28.490" style="s2">can&#39;t really change one without changing</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.930" end="00:55:31.810" style="s2">another you need to kind of solve</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.490" end="00:55:33.580" style="s2">poverty and climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.810" end="00:55:36.250" style="s2">misinformation and all</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.580" end="00:55:37.930" style="s2">stuff simultaneously you need a tech</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.250" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">cooperative to do that in my opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.930" end="00:55:41.140" style="s2">so we&#39;re creating that&#39;s a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:46.530" style="s2">within our capacity of the people</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.140" end="00:55:46.530" style="s2">involved right so listen</p>
