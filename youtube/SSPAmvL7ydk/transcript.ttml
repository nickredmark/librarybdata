<p begin="00:01:40.530" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">love to ask you but I think to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">with a theme you know our school we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">a training center that&#39;s okay this lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">on whatever referred to as the primal</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:57.960" style="s2">hearts right kid basically looking at</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">you know all the essential skill sets</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.960" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">that we as humans have practiced and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">preserved and continued using at some</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">level either you know from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:15.710" style="s2">perspective that we focus on is like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">barrier you kind of fun</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.710" end="00:02:19.800" style="s2">you know base look like you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">awareness and tracking you know these</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:24.990" style="s2">are the skills of perception that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.500" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">have been doing since the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.990" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">time you know and survival skill which</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">is you know the essence of existing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">being here skills with healing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">preserving life and then let&#39;s go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">combat and so those four kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:48.750" style="s2">elements great like this this training</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">curriculum that is is the skill sets we</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.750" end="00:02:52.530" style="s2">focused on and then we have behind that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:03:01.410" style="s2">a layer just to give you a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.530" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">orientation to conversation the the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.410" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">layer of scales is a focus on the art or</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:11.390" style="s2">the experience of training and growth</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:11.390" style="s2">and so there&#39;s kind of this a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.810" end="00:03:20.310" style="s2">multi-dimensional and multi-layered</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.310" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">training progression so it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.310" end="00:03:26.040" style="s2">of a model beyond after the science art</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">and philosophy concept of or I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.040" end="00:03:35.220" style="s2">the yes I&#39;d be the true the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">good that gave me kind of a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.220" end="00:03:43.380" style="s2">reference so so that&#39;s then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">way I&#39;ve set up is we have one class</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.380" end="00:03:49.530" style="s2">every month and it goes around great for</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:51.150" style="s2">a year-long curriculum and mostly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.530" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">for local folks that live around here</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.150" end="00:03:57.000" style="s2">but I do have some people come in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to guest up online anyway</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:04:04.590" style="s2">the the where we&#39;re focusing right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:06.269" style="s2">is a class I call know thyself and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.590" end="00:04:10.350" style="s2">course following your work I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.269" end="00:04:11.880" style="s2">was important and that it would be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.350" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">ultimate talk to you on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.880" end="00:04:20.299" style="s2">so that happens to be and what we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">referred to as the tracking direction so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.299" end="00:04:26.700" style="s2">if you can you know I think of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:27.820" style="s2">tracking courses have essentially real</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:30.700" style="s2">layers of depth</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.820" end="00:04:37.090" style="s2">it&#39;s the hard schedules of tracking and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.700" end="00:04:40.330" style="s2">then the the class we call the path</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:43.270" style="s2">which is basically the path of training</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.330" end="00:04:44.890" style="s2">you know if you will so it&#39;s and then we</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.270" end="00:04:48.700" style="s2">get into know thyself with which is like</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.890" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">the philosophy so that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.700" end="00:04:54.970" style="s2">ready now just to give you a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:05:00.130" style="s2">context and in this is yeah I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.970" end="00:05:03.160" style="s2">good how big of a community is that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.130" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">know it&#39;s it it&#39;s been a dissipative</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.160" end="00:05:08.140" style="s2">structure so we have people coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">dae-ho and it seems to be you know we</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.140" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">have we have kind of a base community</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:17.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s also been you know something it</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:20.110" style="s2">it seems what happens is it inspires</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.320" end="00:05:21.760" style="s2">people they have that if they go through</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.110" end="00:05:23.500" style="s2">our programs they kind of get inspired</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.760" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">and they kind of go through this cycle</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.500" end="00:05:27.160" style="s2">and then end up getting released into</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">the world and doing that thing so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.160" end="00:05:32.410" style="s2">ended up having a community an extended</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">community but it&#39;s not necessarily to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.410" end="00:05:36.450" style="s2">all here all the time you know so I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:38.500" style="s2">I have a have a few students that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.450" end="00:05:41.010" style="s2">practice you know like martial arts we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.500" end="00:05:41.010" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.160" end="00:05:49.330" style="s2">so I nice ways I mean it&#39;s I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.770" end="00:05:52.120" style="s2">its quality over quantity so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.330" end="00:05:54.730" style="s2">probably had you know that been here</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:57.730" style="s2">through time like deeply probably 5200</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.730" end="00:06:01.170" style="s2">people and then a lot of rip wasn&#39;t from</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.730" end="00:06:03.690" style="s2">there how long have you been doing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.170" end="00:06:06.940" style="s2">about 28 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.690" end="00:06:10.680" style="s2">yeah the school itself about 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.940" end="00:06:13.870" style="s2">and then kind of preparation for that so</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.680" end="00:06:16.900" style="s2">yeah and are you say we who else is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.870" end="00:06:21.910" style="s2">working there with you um well actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.900" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">me my wife and then primarily I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.910" end="00:06:26.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve been kind of the the head</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:29.020" style="s2">instructor this whole time I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.500" end="00:06:32.770" style="s2">few assistant instructors along the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.020" end="00:06:34.750" style="s2">and but it&#39;s been kind of a small small</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.770" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">thing where I kind of act as a guide in</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.750" end="00:06:41.350" style="s2">this experience of that basically it</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:43.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.350" end="00:06:45.370" style="s2">vehicles for it has been mentorship I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.540" end="00:06:52.780" style="s2">would say right right right</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.370" end="00:06:53.980" style="s2">you it&#39;s that confrontation so wow</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.780" end="00:06:56.470" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.980" end="00:06:59.650" style="s2">that&#39;s very well I like I like I like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.470" end="00:07:01.660" style="s2">getting into contact with these emergent</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.650" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">communities of practice in the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.660" end="00:07:08.050" style="s2">ecology practices and I find it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:12.700" style="s2">really really stimulating and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.050" end="00:07:17.110" style="s2">thought-provoking so you found some</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.700" end="00:07:18.700" style="s2">amazing ones yeah by tacwise so well</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.110" end="00:07:23.110" style="s2">well one more thing I&#39;d like to share</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.700" end="00:07:25.390" style="s2">Thea&#39;s is from your impact is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.110" end="00:07:28.990" style="s2">I found very powerful and when I say</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.390" end="00:07:33.310" style="s2">healing you know I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.990" end="00:07:38.380" style="s2">training in a number of areas that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.310" end="00:07:41.980" style="s2">feel like be extremely powerful and one</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.380" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">of them has been with man named Tom</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.980" end="00:07:48.610" style="s2">Brown jr. who&#39;s a tracker and he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:52.030" style="s2">trained in the old way by a Apache elder</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.610" end="00:07:55.210" style="s2">you know learned this very grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.030" end="00:07:58.450" style="s2">very at the same time transformative in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.210" end="00:08:00.010" style="s2">even spiritual experience right so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.450" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">been trying to learn I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.010" end="00:08:08.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve been learning from him for the last</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:17.050" style="s2">years yeah in that process you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.980" end="00:08:23.940" style="s2">the teaching style and the the culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.050" end="00:08:27.880" style="s2">that it comes from is very I would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.940" end="00:08:31.140" style="s2">their focus is on awareness you know and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.880" end="00:08:34.660" style="s2">the focus is on earth connection and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.140" end="00:08:37.380" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a departure from our</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.660" end="00:08:39.940" style="s2">normal from our Western perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.380" end="00:08:42.550" style="s2">they&#39;re a very I mean one way to explain</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.940" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">it is a very organized around space so</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.550" end="00:08:46.630" style="s2">it&#39;s very how we&#39;re often open right</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:51.250" style="s2">around time it seems they&#39;re kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.630" end="00:08:53.530" style="s2">spatial right world and so a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.250" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">language and a lot of the teaching kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.530" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:09:01.779" style="s2">has to do with has to do with that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:05.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a reference to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.779" end="00:09:08.260" style="s2">called kayo teaching which is a a way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.830" end="00:09:09.730" style="s2">conveying less uneven conveying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.260" end="00:09:12.460" style="s2">drawing people through experiences</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.730" end="00:09:16.120" style="s2">instead of trying to give them</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.460" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">information and kind of we tend to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.120" end="00:09:21.730" style="s2">a experience gel pulling someone through</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:23.770" style="s2">through mystery basically in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.730" end="00:09:25.029" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know what&#39;s happening to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.770" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">them and they end up putting together</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.029" end="00:09:30.310" style="s2">their own experience and so very uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:32.140" style="s2">what I&#39;ve learned kind of through you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.310" end="00:09:35.710" style="s2">very Socratic and nature&#39;s globe they</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.140" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">use that yeah these the what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.710" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">this sacred question or the art of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:45.070" style="s2">questioning and that&#39;s one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:46.900" style="s2">vehicles so not because they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.070" end="00:09:48.850" style="s2">generative yeah they don&#39;t collapse on</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.900" end="00:09:53.260" style="s2">the answer you know they expand into</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.850" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a amazing way to learn and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.260" end="00:09:57.720" style="s2">teach</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.470" end="00:10:01.740" style="s2">but what I found from your work is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.720" end="00:10:05.710" style="s2">your precision with language and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.740" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">defining terms and somehow building the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.710" end="00:10:15.550" style="s2">bridge from a very grounded scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">you know place to to bridging all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.550" end="00:10:21.460" style="s2">way to this metaphorical realm that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:23.170" style="s2">been learning from so the language is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.460" end="00:10:26.220" style="s2">often get to learn through is basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.170" end="00:10:30.610" style="s2">a metaphor powerful and it works</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.220" end="00:10:33.730" style="s2">surprisingly well actually but to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.610" end="00:10:38.500" style="s2">this have it grounded in the physical in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.730" end="00:10:39.910" style="s2">this way or in how do you explain it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:43.330" style="s2">it&#39;s been very powerful and very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.910" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">filled in a lot of gaps for me what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.330" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">just the name of the teaching would you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:51.100" style="s2">say coyote teaching or what was it nimma</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:52.390" style="s2">that&#39;s cool I don&#39;t know I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.100" end="00:10:54.970" style="s2">learn more about that and especially</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.390" end="00:10:56.500" style="s2">that the art of sacred questions well</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.970" end="00:10:59.770" style="s2">you could see why be very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.500" end="00:11:04.360" style="s2">that do you written down or the videos</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.770" end="00:11:08.019" style="s2">about this uh there&#39;s from this lineage</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.360" end="00:11:12.429" style="s2">say there and this is a pretty broad</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.019" end="00:11:15.220" style="s2">brought right group so when I said you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.429" end="00:11:17.499" style="s2">know 50-100 people that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.220" end="00:11:19.029" style="s2">people who were seriously with me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.499" end="00:11:20.619" style="s2">their community there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.029" end="00:11:24.309" style="s2">underground movement going on that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.619" end="00:11:28.749" style="s2">that&#39;s worldwide and so there is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.309" end="00:11:30.970" style="s2">of material I only know of Tompkins</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.749" end="00:11:33.549" style="s2">books Tom Brown he&#39;s written a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.970" end="00:11:35.819" style="s2">books as well as but they&#39;re more our</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.549" end="00:11:38.019" style="s2">story you know there&#39;s there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.819" end="00:11:40.989" style="s2">there&#39;s tons of teaching in them but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.019" end="00:11:44.790" style="s2">can see how I don&#39;t that might be a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.989" end="00:11:47.679" style="s2">place to start actually okay so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.790" end="00:11:50.679" style="s2">yes please give me some links or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.679" end="00:11:52.299" style="s2">that way yeah and then another reference</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.679" end="00:11:56.350" style="s2">is John Young who&#39;s not a teacher of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.299" end="00:11:59.139" style="s2">mine he&#39;s he&#39;s taught courses in the art</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.350" end="00:12:02.860" style="s2">of mentoring and it&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.139" end="00:12:06.579" style="s2">powerful so most of those please thank</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.860" end="00:12:13.689" style="s2">you bet I would appreciate that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.579" end="00:12:16.059" style="s2">uh so yeah I just wanted to say the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.689" end="00:12:17.799" style="s2">value of somehow however you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.059" end="00:12:19.269" style="s2">language to spin at least from my mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.799" end="00:12:22.029" style="s2">it&#39;s been really powerful really</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.269" end="00:12:24.009" style="s2">effective so with that where&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.029" end="00:12:26.860" style="s2">start is actually maybe just asking you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.009" end="00:12:28.029" style="s2">to define a few things even though</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.860" end="00:12:31.689" style="s2">you&#39;ve defined them before in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.029" end="00:12:32.980" style="s2">material but I think for our audience it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.689" end="00:12:35.319" style="s2">would be really powerful and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.980" end="00:12:43.149" style="s2">trying to get people exposed to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.319" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">work so thank you so so with that well</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.149" end="00:12:47.679" style="s2">actually you know what could you tell us</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:50.170" style="s2">a little bit about your background in</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.679" end="00:12:51.669" style="s2">relationship to this idea of know</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.170" end="00:12:58.059" style="s2">thyself and maybe it&#39;ll kind of reveal</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.669" end="00:13:06.329" style="s2">why oh okay well that&#39;s a little long</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.059" end="00:13:10.290" style="s2">story where to start I came out of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.329" end="00:13:13.239" style="s2">fundamentalist Christian background that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.290" end="00:13:15.459" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting no matter what how</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.239" end="00:13:17.649" style="s2">people end up their religious upbringing</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.459" end="00:13:20.910" style="s2">goes like it gets almost into your like</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.649" end="00:13:23.729" style="s2">your into your DNA right into your</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.910" end="00:13:28.589" style="s2">the the rudiments of your thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.729" end="00:13:32.220" style="s2">being but I left that for Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.589" end="00:13:34.319" style="s2">because it was ultimately very but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.220" end="00:13:38.100" style="s2">was very traumatizing on me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.319" end="00:13:39.869" style="s2">ways and it became very antagonistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.100" end="00:13:45.179" style="s2">towards Christianity religion in general</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.869" end="00:13:47.549" style="s2">and in university I encountered the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.179" end="00:13:52.979" style="s2">figure of Socrates in a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.549" end="00:13:55.970" style="s2">course and it had a huge and profound</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.979" end="00:14:01.739" style="s2">impact on me because I saw a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.970" end="00:14:03.989" style="s2">cultivating wisdom and virtue and what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.739" end="00:14:06.239" style="s2">would later come to call you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.989" end="00:14:07.139" style="s2">of spirituality I don&#39;t like that term</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.239" end="00:14:12.029" style="s2">but that we don&#39;t have a better one</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.139" end="00:14:17.779" style="s2">right now and that had a huge impact on</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.029" end="00:14:23.100" style="s2">me and so Socrates is very much for me a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.779" end="00:14:24.869" style="s2">sacred figure in that I as you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.100" end="00:14:28.470" style="s2">because there&#39;s all these thoughts are</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.869" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">like there isn&#39;t one Socrates I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.470" end="00:14:32.579" style="s2">was a historical figure presumably but</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:35.039" style="s2">you know there&#39;s somebody&#39;s has seen</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.579" end="00:14:37.109" style="s2">through the eyes of Plato and then as</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.039" end="00:14:39.509" style="s2">seen through the eyes of this the cynics</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.109" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">and the Stoics see through the eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.509" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">you know pero and skeptics or Epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:48.899" style="s2">in the Epicurean so right there&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:50.519" style="s2">there&#39;s this huge it&#39;s like a pebble</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.899" end="00:14:54.659" style="s2">dumping upon there&#39;s issues ripple</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.519" end="00:14:57.419" style="s2">effect that comes out and what what what</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.659" end="00:15:01.759" style="s2">I saw is that I can return to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.419" end="00:15:04.739" style="s2">rippling again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.759" end="00:15:08.129" style="s2">when I do I see things that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.739" end="00:15:11.069" style="s2">seen before and I challenged in ways I</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.129" end="00:15:13.529" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been showers before and then I go</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.069" end="00:15:16.199" style="s2">out into the world and that interaction</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.529" end="00:15:18.209" style="s2">slowly percolates through my life and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.199" end="00:15:20.939" style="s2">permeates from my consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.209" end="00:15:23.489" style="s2">cognition and who I am and the way I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.939" end="00:15:26.149" style="s2">in the world sort of changes right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.489" end="00:15:28.679" style="s2">then after those changes I go back again</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.149" end="00:15:32.850" style="s2">into that whole tradition and I see</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.679" end="00:15:35.070" style="s2">things I hadn&#39;t seen before and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.850" end="00:15:37.530" style="s2">they have for transformation</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.070" end="00:15:39.960" style="s2">and transcendent and so this this has</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.530" end="00:15:43.800" style="s2">just been happening through the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.960" end="00:15:46.700" style="s2">my life the figure of Socrates is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.800" end="00:15:52.200" style="s2">it&#39;s inspirate he is inspirational</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.700" end="00:15:58.770" style="s2">aspirational he write and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.200" end="00:15:59.970" style="s2">constantly encouraging me I don&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.770" end="00:16:02.670" style="s2">that I want to really clear on that word</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.970" end="00:16:05.790" style="s2">not just in the sense of motivational</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.670" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">but in the sense of exemplifying helping</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.790" end="00:16:10.710" style="s2">me to become more courageous what</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">killing could call the courage to be so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.710" end="00:16:16.590" style="s2">Socrates is doing all of that but of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:21.330" style="s2">course he&#39;s also constantly challenging</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.590" end="00:16:23.070" style="s2">any temptation and of course I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.330" end="00:16:26.540" style="s2">prey to it you know to</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.540" end="00:16:37.800" style="s2">and so he has been a constant companion</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.820" end="00:16:42.750" style="s2">for me in a profound way and that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.800" end="00:16:46.350" style="s2">carried into the project that he</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.350" end="00:16:50.640" style="s2">that he sort of took although it&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.990" end="00:16:53.010" style="s2">faceted the project he took is whose</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.640" end="00:16:55.020" style="s2">central project and it goes by different</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.010" end="00:16:56.490" style="s2">names it&#39;s you know he wants the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.020" end="00:16:58.020" style="s2">examined life because the unexamined</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.490" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">life is not worth living he wants to</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.250" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">constantly many different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.410" end="00:17:22.020" style="s2">gesturing towards this core thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.600" end="00:17:25.140" style="s2">right his love of wisdom and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.020" end="00:17:27.329" style="s2">that there he doesn&#39;t give an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.140" end="00:17:30.210" style="s2">that but does exactly what I said he</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.329" end="00:17:32.370" style="s2">right he gives you these partial answers</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.210" end="00:17:34.980" style="s2">that are always meant to take you to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.370" end="00:17:39.480" style="s2">other answers and while while your whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.980" end="00:17:44.190" style="s2">life is doing this right that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.480" end="00:17:46.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how he is has been an</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.190" end="00:17:50.190" style="s2">instrument in an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.650" end="00:17:52.590" style="s2">I hope that answer your question yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.190" end="00:17:55.410" style="s2">that&#39;s great um that sounds really</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.590" end="00:17:58.350" style="s2">familiar that that experience sounds</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.410" end="00:18:03.330" style="s2">like much of what I&#39;m trying to scribe</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.350" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">with coyote Qing right I think the power</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.330" end="00:18:09.420" style="s2">questions obviously so and then also I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:12.060" style="s2">just want people to understand that new</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.420" end="00:18:17.130" style="s2">you&#39;re also a cognitive scientist you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.060" end="00:18:18.540" style="s2">are you know sure those those tell us a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.130" end="00:18:21.720" style="s2">little bit about work and how that might</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.540" end="00:18:23.460" style="s2">really to notice though so yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.720" end="00:18:26.010" style="s2">not plugging psychologists are cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.460" end="00:18:28.010" style="s2">scientists at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.010" end="00:18:30.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve been teaching and researching and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.010" end="00:18:36.420" style="s2">writing and publishing and you know all</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.900" end="00:18:44.610" style="s2">that since 1994 and so I do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.420" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">work around this notion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.610" end="00:18:49.770" style="s2">ultimately inspired by Socrates of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:53.240" style="s2">is a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.770" end="00:18:56.820" style="s2">what is the cultivation of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.240" end="00:19:01.140" style="s2">surprisingly those questions we</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.820" end="00:19:03.330" style="s2">cognitive science of the psychology have</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.140" end="00:19:04.950" style="s2">gotten to a point where things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.330" end="00:19:08.610" style="s2">people might not have originally</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.950" end="00:19:11.730" style="s2">associated with Socrates or I can now be</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.610" end="00:19:13.980" style="s2">put into deep discussion deep dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.730" end="00:19:15.480" style="s2">with the Socratic corpus so as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.980" end="00:19:18.690" style="s2">cognitive scientist I&#39;m doing work on</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.480" end="00:19:20.100" style="s2">you know you know the nature of brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.690" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">functioning or artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.100" end="00:19:25.800" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s surprising how getting a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:29.340" style="s2">deeper understanding of that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.800" end="00:19:32.700" style="s2">affords me a deeper understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.340" end="00:19:37.400" style="s2">Socratic project and so what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.700" end="00:19:41.220" style="s2">is I&#39;ve become very interested around</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.400" end="00:19:45.480" style="s2">what kind of psycho technologies can</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.220" end="00:19:50.210" style="s2">people internalized such that they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.480" end="00:19:52.950" style="s2">better cultivate what Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.210" end="00:19:57.180" style="s2">trying to draw draw from them try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.950" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">induce from them and so and those are</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.180" end="00:20:00.210" style="s2">you know those are you can see you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">see in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.210" end="00:20:03.690" style="s2">census of all of these in Socrates in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:06.540" style="s2">the dialogue obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.690" end="00:20:09.450" style="s2">mindfulness practices Socrates could</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.540" end="00:20:11.790" style="s2">stand in place like in a meditative</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.450" end="00:20:15.930" style="s2">state of 48 hours straight like just</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.790" end="00:20:18.990" style="s2">profound abilities right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.930" end="00:20:20.520" style="s2">obviously their stuff we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.990" end="00:20:22.170" style="s2">about but it&#39;s only alluded to because</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.520" end="00:20:25.080" style="s2">it was so presupposed the Greek culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.170" end="00:20:28.140" style="s2">Socrates of course showed great courage</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.080" end="00:20:30.270" style="s2">on the battlefield we know he he was he</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.140" end="00:20:32.490" style="s2">had some martial art training</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.270" end="00:20:34.800" style="s2">he&#39;s clearly spending a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.490" end="00:20:37.950" style="s2">the gymnasium doing a lot of mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.800" end="00:20:39.180" style="s2">work again they know just Plato means</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.950" end="00:20:41.850" style="s2">broad shoulders because he was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.180" end="00:20:44.040" style="s2">wrestler right all of this is just throw</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.850" end="00:20:45.990" style="s2">presuppose that they don&#39;t even but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.040" end="00:20:47.340" style="s2">know if you read the Republic Plato goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.990" end="00:20:48.800" style="s2">a lot about how the body has to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.340" end="00:20:53.040" style="s2">trained properly</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.800" end="00:20:58.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s that there&#39;s Pharma teases</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.040" end="00:21:01.920" style="s2">capacity for you know questioning people</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.200" end="00:21:04.560" style="s2">leading them to aporia you know the a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.920" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">realization of how much they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.560" end="00:21:10.140" style="s2">deceiving themselves such that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">they might be open to fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.140" end="00:21:16.890" style="s2">restructuring their thinking so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:19.170" style="s2">these practices are now practices and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.890" end="00:21:21.180" style="s2">processes that are being studied quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.170" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">deeply within cognitive psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.180" end="00:21:25.190" style="s2">cognitive science so it&#39;s possible and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:27.390" style="s2">this is what cognitive science does</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.190" end="00:21:29.220" style="s2">because because in kind of sites are</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.390" end="00:21:30.750" style="s2">often trying to connect up artificial</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.220" end="00:21:32.250" style="s2">intelligence how will you give these</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.750" end="00:21:33.870" style="s2">abilities into machine you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.250" end="00:21:36.510" style="s2">this weird question which is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.870" end="00:21:39.480" style="s2">reverse engineering question so you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.510" end="00:21:41.100" style="s2">given this process how can I reverse</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.480" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">engineer that so I can get it down to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.100" end="00:21:46.160" style="s2">its basic processes right and so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">and I mean this with the deepest was</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.160" end="00:21:51.720" style="s2">respecting the rotom&#39;s we are getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:53.250" style="s2">some of the signs that we&#39;ll have that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.720" end="00:21:55.940" style="s2">allow us to sort of reverse engineer</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.250" end="00:21:59.700" style="s2">Socrates and what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.940" end="00:22:01.680" style="s2">and in connection with that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.700" end="00:22:04.170" style="s2">you know these two ideas which is like</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.680" end="00:22:06.630" style="s2">an ecology of practices and I alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.170" end="00:22:08.280" style="s2">them already know Socrates is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.630" end="00:22:10.260" style="s2">some mindfulness stuff going on there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.280" end="00:22:13.530" style="s2">mine you know there&#39;s mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.260" end="00:22:14.179" style="s2">interaction integration going on there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.530" end="00:22:20.539" style="s2">these quest</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.179" end="00:22:23.559" style="s2">giving inside practices and then what</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.539" end="00:22:26.299" style="s2">Socrates also exemplifies for me is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.559" end="00:22:27.950" style="s2">above and beyond the ecology practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.299" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">and this was an idea provoked for I</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.950" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">Jordan Hall always be grateful for</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:36.379" style="s2">invoking the right is there the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:39.169" style="s2">a meta psycho technology that you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.379" end="00:22:42.710" style="s2">collates and curates and right the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.169" end="00:22:44.299" style="s2">ecology of practices and there was in</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.710" end="00:22:46.220" style="s2">the ancient world there was such a meta</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.299" end="00:22:48.950" style="s2">second cycle technology that came right</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.220" end="00:22:52.940" style="s2">out of the Socratic tradition and it has</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.950" end="00:22:53.960" style="s2">the name dialectic the problem is if</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.940" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">people have heard that where before</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.960" end="00:22:59.929" style="s2">they&#39;ve probably heard it in Hegel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:03.230" style="s2">voice and Hegel is much much later and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.929" end="00:23:04.730" style="s2">so he has his own particular post Conti</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.230" end="00:23:08.210" style="s2">and slant on it which I think in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.730" end="00:23:11.059" style="s2">ways is misleading so what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.210" end="00:23:14.299" style="s2">understand and what nc dialectic is is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.059" end="00:23:15.769" style="s2">complex process and you have to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.299" end="00:23:18.649" style="s2">walk you have to go through the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.769" end="00:23:19.970" style="s2">tradition like the photonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.649" end="00:23:22.279" style="s2">the stoic tradition of the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.970" end="00:23:23.809" style="s2">tradition to try and get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.279" end="00:23:26.389" style="s2">this is because it&#39;s both an individual</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.809" end="00:23:29.809" style="s2">practice right and also a collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.389" end="00:23:32.809" style="s2">practice and so a lot of my most recent</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.809" end="00:23:34.940" style="s2">work has been trying to reverse engineer</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.809" end="00:23:37.460" style="s2">that with the help of Christopher Massa</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.940" end="00:23:40.009" style="s2">Pietro and guy sent stock in Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.460" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">and Peter Lindbergh reverse engineer</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.009" end="00:23:47.720" style="s2">that and do a lot of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:49.749" style="s2">observation of very like these upon</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.720" end="00:23:53.509" style="s2">taneous lee emerged discourse practices</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.749" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">like circling and empathy circling and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.509" end="00:23:58.789" style="s2">inside dialogue it goes on and on and on</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:01.249" style="s2">right there right there&#39;s a week but</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.789" end="00:24:02.749" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.249" end="00:24:04.909" style="s2">plausibility argument there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.749" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">why independent a second it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.909" end="00:24:08.749" style="s2">convergent evolution there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:10.879" style="s2">why independently all and now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.749" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">introduced me to a new one right now all</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.879" end="00:24:15.889" style="s2">these all these discourse authentic</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:16.820" style="s2">relation right practices and communities</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.889" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">are emerging</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.820" end="00:24:20.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a real phenomena that bespeaks</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:24.619" style="s2">that&#39;s something there&#39;s a lack right</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.990" end="00:24:27.770" style="s2">there&#39;s something missing right and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.619" end="00:24:29.000" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to get in</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.770" end="00:24:31.130" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m so pleased to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.000" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">right now I&#39;m doing all the talking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.130" end="00:24:36.380" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m just really emotional that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:38.809" style="s2">great so right trying to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.380" end="00:24:40.690" style="s2">are all right what&#39;s the lack what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.809" end="00:24:44.450" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.690" end="00:24:46.910" style="s2">communities like reverse engineer</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.450" end="00:24:49.700" style="s2">Socrates and also do the participant</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.910" end="00:24:52.550" style="s2">observation and try to get all of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.700" end="00:24:57.429" style="s2">together to try and come up with what</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.550" end="00:25:00.770" style="s2">dialectic might might look like Wow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.429" end="00:25:05.900" style="s2">that&#39;s powerful you know something you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.770" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">were recently I I watched the your</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.900" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">lecture in the meditation series on</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.420" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">lectio divina just as a as a practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.650" end="00:25:24.410" style="s2">something you remind me of this I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:28.850" style="s2">to make sure I I communicated that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.410" end="00:25:30.410" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that practice as</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.850" end="00:25:32.690" style="s2">you described it was like oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.410" end="00:25:36.800" style="s2">that is that&#39;s how we do tracking you</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.690" end="00:25:39.860" style="s2">know that&#39;s we use you know rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.800" end="00:25:41.990" style="s2">the poetry we have all of nature you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.860" end="00:25:43.880" style="s2">know so you have you&#39;re actually making</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.990" end="00:25:46.790" style="s2">contact I was doing it last night you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.880" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">actually making contact with some aspect</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.790" end="00:25:51.470" style="s2">of nature and allowing it to you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:53.090" style="s2">you&#39;re going through a similar process I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.470" end="00:25:54.800" style="s2">don&#39;t remember exactly you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.090" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">to kind of research how you laid it out</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.800" end="00:26:01.210" style="s2">but it is this kind of ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:06.650" style="s2">this kind of revealing conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.210" end="00:26:09.080" style="s2">with entity and and becoming it and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.650" end="00:26:11.480" style="s2">of these you know yeah there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.080" end="00:26:12.890" style="s2">layers in that there&#39;s just like which</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.480" end="00:26:16.760" style="s2">really kind of makes me curious about</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.890" end="00:26:21.260" style="s2">how old that type of thinking is because</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.760" end="00:26:25.270" style="s2">Tracking&#39;s obviously yeah yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.260" end="00:26:27.830" style="s2">you I mean they&#39;re tracking I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.270" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">there&#39;s arguments right that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.830" end="00:26:33.740" style="s2">one of the big drivers of the expansion</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:40.580" style="s2">right lobes and probably also the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.740" end="00:26:42.530" style="s2">cerebellum frontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.580" end="00:26:45.860" style="s2">so yeah I think I would imagine that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.530" end="00:26:49.690" style="s2">the practice you do is is harkening back</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.860" end="00:26:54.890" style="s2">to something that&#39;s primordial Alexia</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.690" end="00:26:57.920" style="s2">probably except Davina probably goes</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.890" end="00:27:03.700" style="s2">back to antiquity within something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.920" end="00:27:08.360" style="s2">the Neoplatonic period so made it</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.700" end="00:27:10.160" style="s2">towards late antiquity and then it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.360" end="00:27:12.260" style="s2">hard to know and then it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.160" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">overlap and get taken up into</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.260" end="00:27:21.290" style="s2">Christianity and a powerful work</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:23.270" style="s2">I see Lex know as performing a very I</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.290" end="00:27:25.130" style="s2">when I talk about it comedies and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.270" end="00:27:28.550" style="s2">practices and you look for sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.130" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">design principles so you want you want</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.550" end="00:27:32.360" style="s2">you want practices that have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:33.830" style="s2">complementary relationship they they</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.360" end="00:27:35.810" style="s2">have complementary sets of strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.830" end="00:27:38.900" style="s2">weaknesses and therefore they can give</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.810" end="00:27:41.330" style="s2">you a process of self correction within</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.900" end="00:27:44.600" style="s2">the ecology and then you want you also</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.330" end="00:27:46.550" style="s2">want layering it sounds like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.600" end="00:27:48.980" style="s2">mentioned a couple times where like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.550" end="00:27:50.810" style="s2">have this practice and then I can layer</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.980" end="00:27:53.180" style="s2">this another practice on it because this</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.810" end="00:27:55.280" style="s2">practice zaps and makes use of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.180" end="00:27:57.380" style="s2">preview it takes it up into itself right</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.280" end="00:28:00.260" style="s2">and then there&#39;s linking practices and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.380" end="00:28:02.030" style="s2">the leading practice is sort of help you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:05.060" style="s2">progress between sort of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.030" end="00:28:07.850" style="s2">the major nodes of your ecology so if</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.060" end="00:28:10.790" style="s2">you have like sort of met mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.850" end="00:28:13.970" style="s2">practices here and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.790" end="00:28:17.300" style="s2">something that is like has much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.970" end="00:28:19.250" style="s2">propositional content in it but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.300" end="00:28:21.710" style="s2">just propositional which is dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.250" end="00:28:23.870" style="s2">then Alexio actually serves the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.710" end="00:28:28.520" style="s2">bridge the bridge is between via logos</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.870" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">and mindfulness practices so in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.520" end="00:28:33.680" style="s2">sense it&#39;s it&#39;s it would be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">to talk to you to see how because you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.680" end="00:28:37.460" style="s2">gave me sort of though you gave me sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.620" style="s2">of forth towards a four or three I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.460" end="00:28:42.950" style="s2">they would they correspond to true the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.620" end="00:28:44.990" style="s2">good and the beautiful oh yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.950" end="00:28:47.090" style="s2">for directions I actually use the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.990" end="00:28:50.390" style="s2">medicine wheel syuko technology as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.090" end="00:28:51.890" style="s2">guide hello yeah that&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.390" end="00:28:53.510" style="s2">powerful and you just and not only</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.890" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">there&#39;s that&#39;s a whole nother thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.510" end="00:28:56.330" style="s2">love to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:58.670" style="s2">but the weight of that thing with</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.330" end="00:29:00.440" style="s2">practice any of those types of tools and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.670" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of found a very I would say</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.440" end="00:29:09.740" style="s2">the core principle based version of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.190" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">it seems to get your mind can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.740" end="00:29:13.100" style="s2">map into it you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:14.540" style="s2">so I actually couldn&#39;t after 20 years of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.100" end="00:29:16.700" style="s2">training of that kind of see the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.540" end="00:29:19.490" style="s2">that way you know it&#39;s a small thing but</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.700" end="00:29:22.130" style="s2">uh well yeah so we have four directions</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.490" end="00:29:23.780" style="s2">which would be our four dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.130" end="00:29:25.310" style="s2">training and they have three layers at</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.780" end="00:29:30.680" style="s2">the depth Beach so there&#39;s two right</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.310" end="00:29:33.260" style="s2">right right so yeah probably trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.680" end="00:29:34.190" style="s2">be a holistic system right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.260" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get out within</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.190" end="00:29:38.930" style="s2">ecology practices and I&#39;m trying to and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:40.010" style="s2">I could be interested in understanding a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.930" end="00:29:42.740" style="s2">bit more</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.010" end="00:29:44.270" style="s2">this isn&#39;t people mistake this were</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.740" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">because they take it to me and the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.270" end="00:29:48.110" style="s2">as sort of making but when John Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:49.790" style="s2">I talk for example about design</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.110" end="00:29:51.620" style="s2">principles we&#39;re not talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.790" end="00:29:53.270" style="s2">that you doesn&#39;t like we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.620" end="00:29:55.490" style="s2">about the structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.270" end="00:29:57.500" style="s2">organization that makes it work right</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.490" end="00:29:58.490" style="s2">okay so I&#39;d like to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.500" end="00:30:04.100" style="s2">that at some point that&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.490" end="00:30:08.630" style="s2">interesting yeah but so and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.100" end="00:30:10.460" style="s2">thing like this has also been I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.630" end="00:30:12.470" style="s2">want to notice them then a little trendy</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.460" end="00:30:15.020" style="s2">fuck you it&#39;s been a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.470" end="00:30:21.680" style="s2">thing for me as I had gotten into this</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.020" end="00:30:26.300" style="s2">and really try to study and enact and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.680" end="00:30:30.230" style="s2">embody this project philosophy other and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.300" end="00:30:32.000" style="s2">you know deal logos I found well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.230" end="00:30:34.400" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with us right now that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">although the history and the content may</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.400" end="00:30:40.670" style="s2">be different I&#39;m capable of entering</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">into you know pretty deep discussions</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.670" end="00:30:47.930" style="s2">with people from you know very you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:50.510" style="s2">separate traditions and that also is</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.930" end="00:30:52.970" style="s2">something that&#39;s really having an impact</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.510" end="00:30:55.640" style="s2">on me it&#39;s like okay why is this what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.970" end="00:30:58.850" style="s2">going on there&#39;s something deep is going</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.640" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">on here something right to me it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.850" end="00:31:03.530" style="s2">suggests some sort of there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:05.270" style="s2">some sort of core either realness or</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.530" end="00:31:07.190" style="s2">trueness about that you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.270" end="00:31:07.880" style="s2">yeah I mean when things start aligning</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.190" end="00:31:16.190" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.880" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">yeah yeah well I&#39;m gonna go back to my</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.190" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">questions just to keep to give this a</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:27.530" style="s2">pathway but hello hello everything so</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:30.049" style="s2">what how would you define so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.530" end="00:31:32.179" style="s2">make this very simple what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.049" end="00:31:34.160" style="s2">to know something and what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.179" end="00:31:35.900" style="s2">and we&#39;ll start with that what does it</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.160" end="00:31:37.490" style="s2">mean to know something so I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.900" end="00:31:46.510" style="s2">about know thyself I&#39;m kind of breaking</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.490" end="00:31:49.309" style="s2">it down so I tend to I like that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.510" end="00:31:50.419" style="s2">posed it to me as a verb rather than as</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.309" end="00:31:52.100" style="s2">a noun you didn&#39;t ask me what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.419" end="00:31:53.690" style="s2">knowledge you asked me what is it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.100" end="00:31:54.770" style="s2">know which i think is a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.690" end="00:31:56.809" style="s2">putting it</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.770" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">because if we think of it as an action</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.809" end="00:32:03.230" style="s2">then we can talk more about doing it</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:06.830" style="s2">well as opposed to trying to get final</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.230" end="00:32:10.909" style="s2">features because I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.830" end="00:32:14.919" style="s2">there I don&#39;t think there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.909" end="00:32:17.210" style="s2">final epistemological answer my</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.919" end="00:32:20.630" style="s2">supervisor for my PhD described himself</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.210" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">as a meta skeptic meta skeptic is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.630" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">convinced there&#39;s knowledge but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:27.380" style="s2">clear there can be a unified final</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:29.750" style="s2">epistemological account of knowledge so</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.380" end="00:32:32.030" style="s2">that is sort of stayed with me but so</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.750" end="00:32:35.929" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s let&#39;s think of it more as</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.030" end="00:32:38.679" style="s2">something we do and then if you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.929" end="00:32:41.900" style="s2">about the doings you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.679" end="00:32:44.539" style="s2">virtues within there and what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.900" end="00:32:47.809" style="s2">virtues are designed to do is to get us</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.539" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">into right relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.809" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">normativity that is appropriate to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:54.830" style="s2">action so I mean and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">Aristotelian point you judge how good</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.830" end="00:33:00.650" style="s2">something is by getting at well what is</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:02.390" style="s2">the normativity that actually regulates</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.650" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">its functioning so what well what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.390" end="00:33:05.090" style="s2">good knife</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:07.070" style="s2">well what&#39;s it do what&#39;s a for cutting</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.090" end="00:33:08.450" style="s2">right okay and what well then what are</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.070" end="00:33:10.070" style="s2">the what&#39;s the structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.450" end="00:33:12.200" style="s2">organization you need and what would</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.070" end="00:33:14.690" style="s2">make it a good knife in virtue of which</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.200" end="00:33:20.299" style="s2">notice the language in virtue of wit it</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.690" end="00:33:21.680" style="s2">cuts well so I I start with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.299" end="00:33:26.810" style="s2">that there&#39;s four kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.680" end="00:33:29.210" style="s2">of knowing and then I try to get out</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.810" end="00:33:32.450" style="s2">what&#39;s the normativity within within</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.210" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">each one and then what&#39;s the virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.450" end="00:33:37.400" style="s2">propria to following that normativity</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:38.990" style="s2">well if you&#39;ll allow me and I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.400" end="00:33:40.850" style="s2">respectfully what&#39;s the virtue that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.990" end="00:33:43.190" style="s2">allows me to track the normativity</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.850" end="00:33:49.130" style="s2">within that particular kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.190" end="00:33:51.500" style="s2">okay so so I take one kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.130" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">which is predominant in our society and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.500" end="00:33:56.120" style="s2">I think it&#39;s oppressively dominant in</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:57.740" style="s2">our society and in for historical</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.120" end="00:34:01.010" style="s2">reasons I can&#39;t go into it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.740" end="00:34:03.710" style="s2">series is propositional knowing and this</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.010" end="00:34:06.140" style="s2">is knowing that something is the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.710" end="00:34:07.850" style="s2">knowing that cats are mammals for</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.140" end="00:34:10.070" style="s2">example right notice I have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.850" end="00:34:15.080" style="s2">proposition all cats are mammals alright</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.070" end="00:34:16.910" style="s2">then so I have certain Dan we want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.080" end="00:34:19.420" style="s2">ask well what&#39;s the normativity here and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.910" end="00:34:23.390" style="s2">it&#39;s this very tortured notion of truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.420" end="00:34:29.480" style="s2">and what is it for something to be true</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.390" end="00:34:31.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably not quite work so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.480" end="00:34:33.800" style="s2">I start going down that pathway I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.310" end="00:34:36.530" style="s2">going to slip into the kind of talk that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.800" end="00:34:38.870" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get away from so another</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.530" end="00:34:41.390" style="s2">way of putting it is is well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.870" end="00:34:43.640" style="s2">problem with the truth you know like in</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.390" end="00:34:46.510" style="s2">propositional knowing well the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.640" end="00:34:50.210" style="s2">well we fall into some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.510" end="00:34:55.160" style="s2">self-deception about knowing our biases</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.210" end="00:34:57.910" style="s2">and our prejudice make us draw the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.160" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">inferences draw the wrong conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.910" end="00:35:05.900" style="s2">etc and so what we need are we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:09.080" style="s2">practices that give us that the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.900" end="00:35:11.990" style="s2">of good conviction that we are convinced</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.080" end="00:35:16.460" style="s2">appropriately we are convinced well and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.990" end="00:35:19.340" style="s2">so I take it that uh so let me finish</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.460" end="00:35:23.210" style="s2">this whole thing right please I take it</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.340" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">that the what we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.210" end="00:35:30.110" style="s2">is a kind of rationality a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:31.670" style="s2">inferential rationality that what people</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.110" end="00:35:35.510" style="s2">have to learn is what&#39;s called active</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.670" end="00:35:38.300" style="s2">open mindedness which is a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.510" end="00:35:43.090" style="s2">looking for how particular biases can</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.300" end="00:35:45.590" style="s2">affect and now form your inferential</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.090" end="00:35:50.090" style="s2">practices your inferential activities or</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.590" end="00:35:53.410" style="s2">inferential actions and so what does</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.090" end="00:35:56.060" style="s2">that mean it means learning about how</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.410" end="00:35:57.650" style="s2">adaptive machinery otherwise adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.060" end="00:35:59.600" style="s2">machinery can interfere with my intern</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.650" end="00:36:01.730" style="s2">inferential practices so let me give a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.600" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">concrete example it&#39;s one it&#39;s an easy</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.730" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2">one and that&#39;s what I like to use</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:11.270" style="s2">confirmation bias right so but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">making inferences we tend to only look</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.270" end="00:36:15.650" style="s2">for inferences that will confirm our</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:18.140" style="s2">already existing beliefs and we only</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.650" end="00:36:20.390" style="s2">give attention to the evidence which</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.140" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">already confirms our belief so part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.390" end="00:36:25.070" style="s2">what active open-mindedness is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">both is we&#39;re a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.070" end="00:36:29.380" style="s2">from standard vision right it&#39;s both an</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:31.640" style="s2">individual practice and a joint practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.380" end="00:36:35.570" style="s2">the individual practices they try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.640" end="00:36:37.460" style="s2">sense sometimes myself to those biases I</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.570" end="00:36:39.530" style="s2">try I try to look throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.460" end="00:36:42.590" style="s2">make a commitment it the bigger the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.530" end="00:36:43.940" style="s2">debate to look for a bias right but try</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.590" end="00:36:45.410" style="s2">to look for a set of biases and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.940" end="00:36:47.090" style="s2">constantly reading about these biases</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.410" end="00:36:48.650" style="s2">but you&#39;d read a Bible just read about</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.090" end="00:36:50.870" style="s2">them and read about them and read about</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.650" end="00:36:52.750" style="s2">them and then when I notice a cop the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.870" end="00:36:55.400" style="s2">notice of confirmation bias and I do now</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.750" end="00:36:57.940" style="s2">actively try to counteract it actively</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.400" end="00:37:02.120" style="s2">reading and I encourage other people to</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.940" end="00:37:06.740" style="s2">do that with me right give me feedback</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.120" end="00:37:11.780" style="s2">on it so I think the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.740" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">knowing is to train your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.780" end="00:37:17.350" style="s2">conviction which is your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:20.270" style="s2">track the normativity of truth within</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.350" end="00:37:22.660" style="s2">inferential knowing to train it with</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.270" end="00:37:24.890" style="s2">active open mindedness and so now</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.660" end="00:37:26.840" style="s2">there&#39;s procedural knowing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.890" end="00:37:29.000" style="s2">knowing how to do something and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.840" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">normativity there isn&#39;t truth its power</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.000" end="00:37:35.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a sense of being empowered and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:41.770" style="s2">similarly we need we need to be properly</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.570" end="00:37:44.570" style="s2">trained so that we get that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.770" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">interactional fluency with things and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.570" end="00:37:48.590" style="s2">this why I&#39;m so interested in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:49.020" style="s2">state what are the conditions that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.590" end="00:37:52.440" style="s2">confused</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.020" end="00:37:54.600" style="s2">why is it so optimal how can it be right</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.440" end="00:37:56.490" style="s2">how can it be misdirected helping it</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.600" end="00:37:58.200" style="s2">actually and this is the right word</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.490" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">because the normativity here is in truth</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.200" end="00:38:03.270" style="s2">its power how can it empower us so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:06.630" style="s2">we have a more skillful interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.270" end="00:38:08.430" style="s2">the world then there&#39;s respectable dog</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.630" end="00:38:09.930" style="s2">this is the camp knowing what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.430" end="00:38:12.780" style="s2">this is knowing what it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.930" end="00:38:15.090" style="s2">here now with this particular salience</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.780" end="00:38:16.920" style="s2">landscape nope</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.090" end="00:38:19.170" style="s2">so one way of thinking about it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.920" end="00:38:21.150" style="s2">perspective knowing it&#39;s you know you</p>

<p begin="00:38:21.150" end="00:38:26.760" style="s2">perspective and so it&#39;s how it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.050" end="00:38:29.700" style="s2">situational awareness it&#39;s your pattern</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.700" end="00:38:33.030" style="s2">obvious right it&#39;s all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.830" end="00:38:36.510" style="s2">and it&#39;s just happening for you right</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.030" end="00:38:38.580" style="s2">now so what what&#39;s what what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.510" end="00:38:42.660" style="s2">virtue there well the virtue there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.580" end="00:38:44.100" style="s2">presence it&#39;s about so you know like and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.660" end="00:38:47.630" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the virtue that they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.100" end="00:38:49.590" style="s2">to get into into into video games</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.630" end="00:38:52.200" style="s2">because what you want is the white</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.590" end="00:38:54.810" style="s2">pattern of interaction so people right</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.200" end="00:38:56.850" style="s2">are that but that has to be in order to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.810" end="00:38:58.020" style="s2">get the right pattern of interaction but</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.850" end="00:38:59.940" style="s2">to give people a sense that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.020" end="00:39:02.460" style="s2">present in the world that you give them</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.940" end="00:39:07.770" style="s2">the right sort of salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.460" end="00:39:10.680" style="s2">and so you know well what how is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.770" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">self-deception there you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.680" end="00:39:15.780" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve got something like bias</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">for inferential learning and you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.780" end="00:39:20.359" style="s2">sort of clumsiness or ineptness</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:22.530" style="s2">or procedural what&#39;s the same thing for</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.359" end="00:39:25.050" style="s2">respect to have a line well you know you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.530" end="00:39:26.760" style="s2">can it you can either lack presence or</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.050" end="00:39:29.190" style="s2">you can project like you can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.760" end="00:39:31.380" style="s2">egocentric for example many people know</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.190" end="00:39:32.940" style="s2">what a limit when I mean when I say</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.380" end="00:39:35.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of error within</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.940" end="00:39:39.000" style="s2">perspective of knowing because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.130" end="00:39:41.790" style="s2">incapable of taking the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.000" end="00:39:45.330" style="s2">another person so what we need is well</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.790" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">what and when you can think about what</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.330" end="00:39:49.800" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing here when you can&#39;t take the</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.800" end="00:39:55.020" style="s2">not really present to you and you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.260" end="00:39:57.810" style="s2">not really present to them right and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.020" end="00:40:00.030" style="s2">can be doing all kinds of this language</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.810" end="00:40:01.560" style="s2">can be flowing but you know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.030" end="00:40:02.700" style="s2">right you know what it&#39;s like when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.560" end="00:40:05.790" style="s2">realize you can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:08.280" style="s2">wait we&#39;re just not in the same world</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.790" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">we&#39;re just not together right you lack</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.280" end="00:40:12.300" style="s2">that co-presence so what&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:15.089" style="s2">emergency there well it&#39;s very there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.300" end="00:40:18.270" style="s2">lot of mindfulness practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.089" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">designed to give us a you know a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.270" end="00:40:25.710" style="s2">insight of the perspective a level and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:28.020" style="s2">so that so what I want are like</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.710" end="00:40:30.930" style="s2">mindfulness practices in trying to kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.020" end="00:40:33.540" style="s2">of virtue within respect rival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.930" end="00:40:35.700" style="s2">so that I&#39;m more reliably overcome two</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.540" end="00:40:39.750" style="s2">tendencies for self-deception and afford</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.700" end="00:40:42.630" style="s2">presence but my ability to do all that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.750" end="00:40:45.089" style="s2">my ability to generate a perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.630" end="00:40:47.579" style="s2">actually based on my it depends on my</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.089" end="00:40:50.700" style="s2">participatory knowing this is the way in</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.579" end="00:40:54.180" style="s2">which my biology my culture and my</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.700" end="00:40:56.369" style="s2">online cook cognition shaped me into an</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.180" end="00:40:58.500" style="s2">agent and shape the environment into an</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.369" end="00:41:00.540" style="s2">arena and it&#39;s happening below my</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.500" end="00:41:02.670" style="s2">consciousness below my ego and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.540" end="00:41:05.190" style="s2">making all of that possible because what</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.670" end="00:41:09.089" style="s2">it does is it opens up affordances for</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.190" end="00:41:11.160" style="s2">me acutely this is graspable to me right</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.089" end="00:41:13.410" style="s2">and you notice how the culture has</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.160" end="00:41:15.900" style="s2">shaped this piece of the world and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.410" end="00:41:18.180" style="s2">has taught me to shape myself to it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.900" end="00:41:20.130" style="s2">that it&#39;s obvious to me that how I</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.180" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">should use this right and of course my</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.130" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">own mind my biology has done the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.839" end="00:41:26.550" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:28.500" style="s2">oh there&#39;s food right and right and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.550" end="00:41:30.810" style="s2">all that participatory knowing is where</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.500" end="00:41:32.790" style="s2">all this dynamical coupling and I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.810" end="00:41:34.470" style="s2">to be really coupled well to the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.790" end="00:41:36.089" style="s2">so and what&#39;s what what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.470" end="00:41:38.490" style="s2">normativity in there it&#39;s being in right</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.490" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">right way to the world so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:45.300" style="s2">affordances reliably and systematically</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">open up for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.300" end="00:41:49.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the self-deception there well</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:51.990" style="s2">it&#39;s reciprocal narrowing where the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.800" end="00:41:53.670" style="s2">I&#39;m inhabiting my agency in the way I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.319" end="00:41:59.250" style="s2">each other down and that&#39;s what Mark</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.250" end="00:42:05.609" style="s2">what&#39;s the virtue the virtue is an agog</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.950" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">a where I&#39;m open I learned right I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.609" end="00:42:11.730" style="s2">learned how to in a reciprocal fashion</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:13.470" style="s2">open up my agency and my arena so that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.730" end="00:42:15.569" style="s2">get a deeper and deeper right</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.470" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">relationship to things that reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.569" end="00:42:19.350" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:22.230" style="s2">so knowing there is to cultivate the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.350" end="00:42:23.640" style="s2">virtues that reliably afford reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.230" end="00:42:26.940" style="s2">openings so my sense of right</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.640" end="00:42:31.760" style="s2">relationship and belonging is more and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.940" end="00:42:36.660" style="s2">more afforded and when I have a set of</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.760" end="00:42:39.750" style="s2">virtues that link all of these four</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.660" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">kinds together that&#39;s the deepest and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.750" end="00:42:44.670" style="s2">can afford to deep transformation deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:46.980" style="s2">understanding which is the really</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.670" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">grasped the significance to get thing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.980" end="00:42:51.000" style="s2">be able to really track and be called by</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:51.780" style="s2">all those normativity x&#39; truths and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.000" end="00:42:54.840" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.780" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">presents right relationship that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.840" end="00:43:00.410" style="s2">knowledge but that&#39;s where knowledge has</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:07.710" style="s2">finally become what I would call wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.410" end="00:43:13.010" style="s2">Wow that was a beautiful yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.710" end="00:43:16.250" style="s2">actually mapped some of those for and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.010" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">ways of knowing and the virtues and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.250" end="00:43:18.630" style="s2">under the Medicine Wheel it&#39;s already to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.630" end="00:43:21.810" style="s2">I&#39;m already embedding it into our</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:28.440" style="s2">curriculum that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.810" end="00:43:29.910" style="s2">so if if like that I mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.440" end="00:43:33.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned from cognitive science if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.910" end="00:43:35.940" style="s2">can build a conceptual vocabulary and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.030" end="00:43:40.850" style="s2">theoretical grammar that allows people</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.940" end="00:43:44.310" style="s2">to take this as tools into their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.850" end="00:43:45.780" style="s2">theorizing and their own like practices</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.310" end="00:43:47.940" style="s2">and their own aspirations to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.780" end="00:43:51.390" style="s2">transformation and they find it reliably</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.940" end="00:43:53.910" style="s2">helpful that that that&#39;s that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.390" end="00:43:56.100" style="s2">important goal for me well that that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.910" end="00:43:59.400" style="s2">happening sir that&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.100" end="00:44:02.520" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.400" end="00:44:06.390" style="s2">so okay so that&#39;s what it means to know</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.520" end="00:44:12.060" style="s2">something worry a definition how about</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.390" end="00:44:14.820" style="s2">we tackle what is a self so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.060" end="00:44:20.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the know thyself that he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.820" end="00:44:23.670" style="s2">circling back to yeah so the thing for</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.100" end="00:44:25.980" style="s2">me has been and this is very some</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.670" end="00:44:29.319" style="s2">product right it&#39;s been not has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.980" end="00:44:32.769" style="s2">trying to draw people out from</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.319" end="00:44:37.390" style="s2">you know it get them to me get them to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.769" end="00:44:40.170" style="s2">move free from a way of thinking of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.390" end="00:44:44.769" style="s2">self that I think is actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.170" end="00:44:48.209" style="s2">detrimental to their flourishing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.769" end="00:44:51.549" style="s2">this is a notion itself as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.209" end="00:44:54.579" style="s2">it&#39;s a notion of self as a stump as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.549" end="00:45:01.079" style="s2">self enclosed thing I sometimes call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.579" end="00:45:05.829" style="s2">the the monolithic mind right that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.079" end="00:45:11.529" style="s2">to have my self is to 2 is to possess a</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.829" end="00:45:13.569" style="s2">point of self enclosure and what what</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.529" end="00:45:16.390" style="s2">makes itself is it sort of its ability</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.569" end="00:45:21.910" style="s2">to track its to talk to itself that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.390" end="00:45:25.869" style="s2">possess itself and grasp itself and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.910" end="00:45:31.749" style="s2">think that is fundamentally mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.869" end="00:45:34.839" style="s2">that sort of Cartesian view that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.749" end="00:45:36.759" style="s2">have a self and it is sort of completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.839" end="00:45:40.930" style="s2">self enclosed I&#39;m gonna keep emphasizing</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.130" end="00:48:11.220" style="s2">know are what are the principles by</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.320" end="00:48:16.390" style="s2">which they like they constrain it to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.220" end="00:48:18.550" style="s2">self-organizing and how can my cognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.390" end="00:48:21.870" style="s2">a here&#39;s another paradox or whose don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.550" end="00:48:25.990" style="s2">lose the eye but how is this how is</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.870" end="00:48:29.170" style="s2">right this reflective consciousness a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.990" end="00:48:32.320" style="s2">and cognition able to become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.170" end="00:48:35.470" style="s2">the constraints on the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.320" end="00:48:38.940" style="s2">so that the self-organizing occurs</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.470" end="00:48:41.260" style="s2">better and better so it gets better at</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.940" end="00:48:42.990" style="s2">overcoming self-deception better at</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.260" end="00:48:44.760" style="s2">zeroing in on the relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.990" end="00:48:48.010" style="s2">ignoring the irrelevant information</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.760" end="00:48:49.510" style="s2">better at cultivating while all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.010" end="00:48:52.990" style="s2">knowledge is we need all the knowings</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.510" end="00:48:54.670" style="s2">that we talk about all the knowings that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.990" end="00:48:56.830" style="s2">we talked about right</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.670" end="00:49:02.860" style="s2">so the Socratic cell</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.830" end="00:49:07.060" style="s2">is basically what how have you come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.860" end="00:49:09.790" style="s2">learn how like how do you let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.060" end="00:49:13.090" style="s2">this way but somebody&#39;s is doing is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.790" end="00:49:17.470" style="s2">he&#39;s getting you to steam where do I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.090" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">commit my resources my precious of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.470" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">limited cognitive resources the my</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:27.100" style="s2">precious and limited relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:28.750" style="s2">myself each other where am I actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.100" end="00:49:32.230" style="s2">committing them compared compared to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.750" end="00:49:35.080" style="s2">what I say let&#39;s say I am because your</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.230" end="00:49:37.330" style="s2">introspection is actually sure right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.080" end="00:49:40.990" style="s2">people think well I sort of I&#39;d be quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.330" end="00:49:43.540" style="s2">a look into myself no this is about good</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.990" end="00:49:46.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not that effective right well I</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.540" end="00:49:49.360" style="s2">state what I&#39;m most most believe he</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.450" end="00:49:49.840" style="s2">believes don&#39;t really capture this very</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.360" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">readily</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.840" end="00:49:54.250" style="s2">so the Socratic project was actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:56.740" style="s2">trying to get people trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.250" end="00:49:58.890" style="s2">people to come to a poor head try to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.740" end="00:50:01.660" style="s2">them to say well they realized oh oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.890" end="00:50:04.060" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m committing to and this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.660" end="00:50:08.350" style="s2">is on committing to it and then say is</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.060" end="00:50:10.630" style="s2">this actually constraining the way in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.350" end="00:50:14.430" style="s2">which I am a fundamental way in which</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.630" end="00:50:17.110" style="s2">emma is self-organizing dynamical system</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.430" end="00:50:20.410" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s gonna lead it more and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.110" end="00:50:25.950" style="s2">more towards wisdom so this is this tell</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.410" end="00:50:30.580" style="s2">is right the self is the way in which I</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.950" end="00:50:34.750" style="s2">would argue your your your your set of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.580" end="00:50:38.140" style="s2">virtue of your character your your</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.750" end="00:50:40.840" style="s2">habits of your deep habits of mine and</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.840" end="00:50:47.020" style="s2">and consciousness your your your</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.020" end="00:50:53.890" style="s2">and all of this is not in you it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.370" end="00:50:55.570" style="s2">relational it&#39;s how like it&#39;s a mind and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.890" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">body are related it&#39;s how mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.570" end="00:50:59.500" style="s2">and world are related on my body and</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.620" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">organizes such that this particular like</p>

<p begin="00:51:42.550" end="00:51:46.450" style="s2">virtual engine a set of constraints so</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.440" end="00:51:49.180" style="s2">that your particulars self-organization</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.180" end="00:51:54.060" style="s2">but I&#39;m asking people Socrates is asking</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.060" end="00:52:02.170" style="s2">or maybe maybe to be more more</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.349" end="00:52:03.730" style="s2">charitable don&#39;t get fixated on just</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.170" end="00:52:06.579" style="s2">your autobiography look at your</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.730" end="00:52:09.369" style="s2">operating manual a lot more look like</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.579" end="00:52:12.700" style="s2">look at your operating manual a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.369" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">try to understand the principles and</p>

<p begin="00:52:19.810" end="00:52:25.089" style="s2">because they&#39;re bound up together is how</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.869" end="00:52:27.910" style="s2">that self transfer how that self</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.089" end="00:52:29.740" style="s2">organization is transformed when you</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.609" end="00:52:40.359" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool that actually ties</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:43.020" style="s2">into something I forgot to mention which</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.359" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">is kind of the whole focus of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.020" end="00:52:48.069" style="s2">little series in the mid king which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:50.050" style="s2">the primal perspective and that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.069" end="00:52:52.270" style="s2">naturally went there of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.050" end="00:52:55.210" style="s2">something that drew me to you to your</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.270" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">work but yeah it&#39;s looking at the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.210" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">principles the processes as the thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.180" end="00:53:05.050" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool would you say then</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.290" end="00:53:06.760" style="s2">the are I mean maybe I&#39;m getting into</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.050" end="00:53:08.410" style="s2">consciousness now and that&#39;s might be</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.760" end="00:53:12.069" style="s2">too big of a question but would you say</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.410" end="00:53:15.700" style="s2">that the it&#39;s what we might experience a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.069" end="00:53:18.940" style="s2">self then is kind of an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.700" end="00:53:22.450" style="s2">property of those two processes yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.940" end="00:53:23.579" style="s2">totally and what&#39;s interesting is so</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.450" end="00:53:27.420" style="s2">that knows</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.579" end="00:53:31.049" style="s2">that we are sort of like like a soul in</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.420" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">the H in sort of the ancient like</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.049" end="00:53:37.499" style="s2">whatever like the the ghost inside the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:39.299" style="s2">machine as I think as Rob put it because</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.499" end="00:53:41.339" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s an older or</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.299" end="00:53:43.799" style="s2">and also a newer sense of soul that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.339" end="00:53:45.479" style="s2">could properly could rehabilitate which</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.799" end="00:53:50.339" style="s2">is also to be able to live within it</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.479" end="00:53:53.630" style="s2">again habitats right but yeah I you</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.339" end="00:53:57.299" style="s2">think that that that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.630" end="00:53:59.099" style="s2">because when you ask people how much</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.299" end="00:54:02.910" style="s2">have you changed in the last ten years</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.099" end="00:54:05.309" style="s2">they&#39;ll say oh I&#39;ve changed so much so</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.910" end="00:54:06.839" style="s2">much you know how much do you think</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.309" end="00:54:08.930" style="s2">you&#39;ll change in the next ten years</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.839" end="00:54:13.229" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t change very much at all and</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.930" end="00:54:14.249" style="s2">then you ask him again in ten years how</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.229" end="00:54:16.829" style="s2">much have you changed</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.249" end="00:54:19.140" style="s2">oh I changed so much I&#39;ve changed so</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.829" end="00:54:20.430" style="s2">much really how much he gonna change in</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.140" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">the next thing is oh I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.430" end="00:54:26.099" style="s2">change very much this is the end of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:30.479" style="s2">history by us right so from right we we</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.099" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">think of ourselves as we we are always</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.479" end="00:54:35.849" style="s2">suffering as if we&#39;re somehow we&#39;ve and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:38.190" style="s2">this is why I don&#39;t like the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.849" end="00:54:40.289" style="s2">perfection that we&#39;ve sum up because</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.190" end="00:54:44.219" style="s2">perfect you you know to come into</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.289" end="00:54:49.410" style="s2">completeness right to be finished so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.219" end="00:54:52.259" style="s2">yeah I I think that you are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.410" end="00:54:55.410" style="s2">continuity of content in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.259" end="00:54:57.809" style="s2">relationships so a continuity of contact</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.410" end="00:55:00.690" style="s2">that continues to give you right</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.809" end="00:55:03.239" style="s2">relationship that gives you presents</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.690" end="00:55:06.180" style="s2">situational awareness they can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.239" end="00:55:08.459" style="s2">you to you know acquire and apply the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.180" end="00:55:12.509" style="s2">right skills that then gets translated</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.459" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">into sets of you know sensibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.509" end="00:55:16.829" style="s2">skills for how you move around your</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:18.959" style="s2">concepts and you get that&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.829" end="00:55:21.930" style="s2">get the propositional knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.959" end="00:55:25.949" style="s2">yourself you should be because you are I</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.930" end="00:55:27.449" style="s2">mean come on you what what exists</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.949" end="00:55:30.359" style="s2">between you and how you were as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.449" end="00:55:34.109" style="s2">two-year-old is not any kind of identity</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.359" end="00:55:37.019" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a continuity so right that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.109" end="00:55:39.649" style="s2">there&#39;s been this process of self or</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.019" end="00:55:42.089" style="s2">zatia self-transcending developmental</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.649" end="00:55:45.539" style="s2">self-organization that got here so</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.089" end="00:55:49.199" style="s2">yourself yourself is in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.539" end="00:55:51.809" style="s2">constantly changing it&#39;s constantly in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.199" end="00:55:53.729" style="s2">process of dynamic change but of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.809" end="00:55:56.130" style="s2">it&#39;s happening at multiple time scales</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.729" end="00:55:58.589" style="s2">like some of the chamber so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.130" end="00:56:00.719" style="s2">changes like momentary and some of it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.589" end="00:56:03.419" style="s2">like it&#39;s at all different levels some</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.719" end="00:56:05.249" style="s2">of its more you know this is like have</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.419" end="00:56:06.779" style="s2">you ever had that experience where you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.249" end="00:56:09.959" style="s2">look back over the last five years and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.779" end="00:56:12.089" style="s2">you go 200 genes I didn&#39;t realize I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.959" end="00:56:13.979" style="s2">changing for those five years at this</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.089" end="00:56:15.169" style="s2">level that I didn&#39;t even know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.979" end="00:56:18.390" style="s2">going on at that time</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.169" end="00:56:23.009" style="s2">yeah yeah I feel like I&#39;m actually going</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.390" end="00:56:30.179" style="s2">through one of those now and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.009" end="00:56:32.099" style="s2">actually helped count something you said</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.179" end="00:56:35.779" style="s2">earlier to I&#39;ve got a check at the time</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.099" end="00:56:35.779" style="s2">I think how how are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.839" end="00:56:46.289" style="s2">the something you said about everything</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.079" end="00:56:47.669" style="s2">being in the relational or birth or I</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.289" end="00:56:50.549" style="s2">guess that&#39;s the perspective of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.669" end="00:56:53.249" style="s2">things as relational I&#39;ve had a real</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.549" end="00:56:55.079" style="s2">powerful shift lately of I mean been</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.249" end="00:56:57.449" style="s2">studying a lot of complexity theory and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.079" end="00:57:02.849" style="s2">that as well on that that&#39;ll do a number</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.449" end="00:57:06.509" style="s2">on your on your but really starting to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.849" end="00:57:08.399" style="s2">tie that back into my training with you</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.509" end="00:57:11.009" style="s2">know the lineage of track and all that</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.399" end="00:57:13.459" style="s2">and how they perceive the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.009" end="00:57:15.809" style="s2">any here all these kind of cliche like</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.459" end="00:57:19.049" style="s2">everything&#39;s connected everything is one</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.809" end="00:57:21.239" style="s2">almost kind of metaphors but but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.049" end="00:57:23.130" style="s2">actually possibly like it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.239" end="00:57:24.689" style="s2">it&#39;s getting more more real to me like</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.130" end="00:57:26.609" style="s2">I&#39;m just like I actually see the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.689" end="00:57:29.219" style="s2">you know like I say the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.609" end="00:57:31.709" style="s2">and has things you know right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.219" end="00:57:33.749" style="s2">moving from that see you&#39;re moving from</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.709" end="00:57:36.209" style="s2">propositions that you might even be have</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.749" end="00:57:38.039" style="s2">been convinced were true right into you</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.209" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">well and you&#39;re starting to get some</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.039" end="00:57:41.880" style="s2">skills but those skills are actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:43.439" style="s2">based on like you said I see the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.880" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">in a particular way and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.439" end="00:57:48.809" style="s2">means that you write you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:50.120" style="s2">right like the way you and the world fit</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.809" end="00:57:52.680" style="s2">together at that participant</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.120" end="00:57:55.890" style="s2">you&#39;re getting it you&#39;re getting like</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.680" end="00:57:58.230" style="s2">your it&#39;s contra being an idea like it</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.890" end="00:58:01.560" style="s2">it&#39;s percolated through all the or for</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.230" end="00:58:03.420" style="s2">you right and so now right yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.560" end="00:58:04.950" style="s2">more real to you because you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.420" end="00:58:06.750" style="s2">have the conviction of its truth you</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.950" end="00:58:08.490" style="s2">have the power of your skills you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.750" end="00:58:09.900" style="s2">the presence of the perspective and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.490" end="00:58:12.540" style="s2">have the sense of being in right</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.900" end="00:58:17.480" style="s2">relationship with reality and man does</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.540" end="00:58:23.270" style="s2">that ever makes things seem real yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.480" end="00:58:23.270" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s been pretty awesome</p>

<p begin="00:58:32.700" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">before yeah I had to tell you this I</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.560" end="00:58:43.800" style="s2">just had a little Epiphany this might be</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:46.020" style="s2">another thing but in your emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.800" end="00:58:48.300" style="s2">dhamma site recently or no how recent</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.020" end="00:58:52.110" style="s2">that is but in your book you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.300" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">it and how it occurred to me that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.110" end="00:58:56.610" style="s2">know for example I teach a survival</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:58:59.280" style="s2">class is just a one day introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.610" end="00:59:01.770" style="s2">do the survival skills and my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.280" end="00:59:06.780" style="s2">tagline for the class is it&#39;s like going</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.770" end="00:59:09.180" style="s2">home and to me what happened to me and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.780" end="00:59:13.230" style="s2">my development through these primitive</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.180" end="00:59:17.010" style="s2">skills is it&#39;s it is a it&#39;s a homecoming</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.230" end="00:59:22.310" style="s2">you know you actually go you go you you</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.010" end="00:59:24.930" style="s2">you enter this this world where you are</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.310" end="00:59:26.700" style="s2">directly connected to everything around</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.930" end="00:59:29.820" style="s2">you in nature you know in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.700" end="00:59:31.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not just something you visit</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.820" end="00:59:33.660" style="s2">or something you go do you or you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.710" end="00:59:35.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s actually home virtually the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.660" end="00:59:38.730" style="s2">skills themselves there&#39;s this like</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.960" end="00:59:40.350" style="s2">reassurance and kind of like this this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.730" end="00:59:42.510" style="s2">relief that washes over you when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.350" end="00:59:45.120" style="s2">realize that you can with your own hands</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.510" end="00:59:46.950" style="s2">and your own body mind you can go create</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.120" end="00:59:48.780" style="s2">what you need to sustain life you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.950" end="00:59:50.550" style="s2">out of whatever&#39;s around you in any</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.780" end="00:59:52.350" style="s2">environment you know it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.550" end="00:59:55.380" style="s2">bullet depending on your skill level but</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.350" end="01:00:01.620" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like the potential is</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.380" end="01:00:03.060" style="s2">there and it&#39;s so the access I just saw</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.620" end="01:00:03.990" style="s2">that kind of as a heat one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.060" end="01:00:06.780" style="s2">healing</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.990" end="01:00:10.050" style="s2">potentials maybe of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.780" end="01:00:11.970" style="s2">skills in that nama side issue I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.050" end="01:00:13.230" style="s2">that&#39;s deeply right I mean you might</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.970" end="01:00:16.200" style="s2">have seen some conversations that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.230" end="01:00:18.690" style="s2">with my friend Dave Kelly he&#39;s teaching</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.200" end="01:00:20.730" style="s2">people you know the parkour in nature</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.690" end="01:00:23.370" style="s2">and then the martial arts and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.730" end="01:00:26.070" style="s2">mindfulness and then the the you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.370" end="01:00:27.690" style="s2">the narrative practices and he&#39;s weaving</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.070" end="01:00:29.250" style="s2">together this beautiful ecology</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.690" end="01:00:33.780" style="s2">practices you two would get along very</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.250" end="01:00:38.790" style="s2">well actually you do know him a little</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.780" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">good I met him this way yeah so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.790" end="01:00:46.200" style="s2">think that you know because he talks in</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:49.320" style="s2">the same way he talks about a profound</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.200" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">kind of homecoming when people can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.320" end="01:00:56.300" style="s2">rich resituated back into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:58.950" style="s2">environment in which they evolved in</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.300" end="01:01:00.570" style="s2">such that all of four of those things</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.950" end="01:01:02.220" style="s2">have to click into place all the four</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.570" end="01:01:04.770" style="s2">kinds of knowing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.220" end="01:01:08.280" style="s2">and so I&#39;m really interested in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.770" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">possibilities that we might have at a</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.280" end="01:01:15.960" style="s2">more systemic level this Jordan Hall was</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.760" end="01:01:17.460" style="s2">talking about this possibility that he</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.960" end="01:01:19.170" style="s2">talked about the idea that up until</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.460" end="01:01:21.090" style="s2">recently the only way we could get the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.170" end="01:01:23.850" style="s2">synergistic effects of distributed</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.090" end="01:01:25.380" style="s2">cognition Minds working together was to</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.850" end="01:01:27.570" style="s2">have them physically close to each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.380" end="01:01:29.580" style="s2">and then the problem with that is what</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.570" end="01:01:32.100" style="s2">is that we suffer all the dilatory</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.580" end="01:01:33.720" style="s2">effects of cities or cut off from nature</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.100" end="01:01:35.940" style="s2">or cut off from each other we get</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.720" end="01:01:38.370" style="s2">Ottomans there&#39;s it really affords</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.940" end="01:01:40.020" style="s2">pandemics it&#39;s mental really bad on your</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.370" end="01:01:41.580" style="s2">mental health etc and you know this</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.020" end="01:01:43.650" style="s2">better than I do and then he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.580" end="01:01:44.760" style="s2">but we have the potential now where we</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.650" end="01:01:47.850" style="s2">could actually separate those two</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.760" end="01:01:49.800" style="s2">because if we could improve this medium</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.850" end="01:01:51.960" style="s2">and improve the psycho tech and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.800" end="01:01:53.670" style="s2">culture around it we could have the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.960" end="01:01:55.980" style="s2">distributed Minds working together</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.670" end="01:01:58.380" style="s2">synergistically but people can go back</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.980" end="01:02:01.470" style="s2">to living in you know small-scale</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.380" end="01:02:03.780" style="s2">communities situated in right in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.470" end="01:02:05.670" style="s2">environment in a you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.780" end="01:02:08.550" style="s2">psychologically and socially and</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.670" end="01:02:10.920" style="s2">ecologically sustainable and healthy way</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.550" end="01:02:14.610" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really exciting</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.920" end="01:02:17.550" style="s2">idea that I think we should be exploring</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.610" end="01:02:18.870" style="s2">them because again I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.550" end="01:02:24.120" style="s2">so many people and I mean this is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.870" end="01:02:25.920" style="s2">compliment to you who have we have read</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.120" end="01:02:27.960" style="s2">what I call reinvent EO and the word</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.920" end="01:02:31.700" style="s2">inventio means to both discover an event</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.960" end="01:02:34.410" style="s2">so you have to eat exactly reinvent your</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.700" end="01:02:36.540" style="s2">embodiment and embeddedness like with</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.410" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and how deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.540" end="01:02:42.090" style="s2">healing this is and you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:45.750" style="s2">people from the outside what that</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.090" end="01:02:48.030" style="s2">healing is going to be like now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.750" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like I can&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.030" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to live in Spain if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:03:01.260" style="s2">go and live in Spain right I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:02.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a personal experience I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.260" end="01:03:05.700" style="s2">even I couldn&#39;t even predict it actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.910" end="01:03:10.500" style="s2">because yeah we&#39;re all different you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.700" end="01:03:12.120" style="s2">you know that&#39;s one of the pleasures of</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.500" end="01:03:15.690" style="s2">being able to train with people and to</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.120" end="01:03:18.110" style="s2">to facilitate and guide I kind of said</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.690" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">he teach but it&#39;s more of a guidance I</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.110" end="01:03:23.070" style="s2">get it set up conditions and</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:25.170" style="s2">environments in which people have</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.070" end="01:03:28.080" style="s2">interactions with the earth and with</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.170" end="01:03:30.300" style="s2">themselves and with each other that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.080" end="01:03:31.260" style="s2">know these lessons form and they they</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.300" end="01:03:32.730" style="s2">get things that I never would have</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.260" end="01:03:36.720" style="s2">gotten so I get to learn the most you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.730" end="01:03:39.420" style="s2">know now we circled around the Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.720" end="01:03:42.060" style="s2">again when you afford people right that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.420" end="01:03:43.950" style="s2">right when you afford people like</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.060" end="01:03:45.840" style="s2">Socrates described himself as a midwife</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.950" end="01:03:47.700" style="s2">when you had four people giving birth to</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.840" end="01:03:50.460" style="s2">themselves in a way that they cannot</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.700" end="01:03:53.610" style="s2">foresee because it requires you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.460" end="01:03:55.800" style="s2">there are truths and I mean you know all</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.610" end="01:03:58.350" style="s2">all senses of knowing like there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.800" end="01:03:59.640" style="s2">truths that are only realized after self</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.350" end="01:04:02.280" style="s2">transcendence and only through</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.640" end="01:04:03.780" style="s2">transformation yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.280" end="01:04:08.130" style="s2">exactly right I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.780" end="01:04:15.210" style="s2">literally the case that you you giving</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.130" end="01:04:17.610" style="s2">birth to other people is you it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.210" end="01:04:19.140" style="s2">it&#39;s weird because when you&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.610" end="01:04:21.360" style="s2">that with other people when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.140" end="01:04:23.640" style="s2">sharing your deep learning with other</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.360" end="01:04:26.190" style="s2">people that&#39;s actually the best teaching</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.640" end="01:04:27.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s paradoxically it you know it</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.190" end="01:04:31.020" style="s2">rebounds on you and you do some of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.960" end="01:04:31.340" style="s2">own unexpectedly most deep learning but</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.020" end="01:04:32.540" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.340" end="01:04:35.000" style="s2">next to that that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.540" end="01:04:38.900" style="s2">dialectic again right bringing that into</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.000" end="01:04:44.360" style="s2">human interaction yeah Wow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.900" end="01:04:48.260" style="s2">beautiful well just maybe sneak in one</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.360" end="01:04:52.820" style="s2">more thought one more question would you</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.260" end="01:04:55.640" style="s2">say back to the self concept this idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.820" end="01:04:58.150" style="s2">of the self could it since it is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.640" end="01:05:00.890" style="s2">an emergent process couldn&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.150" end="01:05:04.700" style="s2">identity of self expand to include other</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.890" end="01:05:07.220" style="s2">I mean oh it does I mean right I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:08.870" style="s2">think your sense of self I mean and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.220" end="01:05:12.010" style="s2">your sense of self moves or I mean we</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.870" end="01:05:14.090" style="s2">know this from I mean not only from</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.010" end="01:05:15.980" style="s2">historical records but also we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.090" end="01:05:17.570" style="s2">doing experimental work when people have</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.980" end="01:05:19.340" style="s2">mystical experiences and higher states</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.570" end="01:05:23.510" style="s2">of consciousness their sense of self</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.340" end="01:05:25.280" style="s2">moves around like in really profound and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.510" end="01:05:28.850" style="s2">transformative ways and this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.280" end="01:05:31.790" style="s2">sort of epi phenomenal then again the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.850" end="01:05:34.030" style="s2">way they are self-organizing changes the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.790" end="01:05:36.770" style="s2">you know the virtual engine of their</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.030" end="01:05:39.620" style="s2">dynamical system they are is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.770" end="01:05:42.070" style="s2">fundamentally been re-engineered in ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.620" end="01:05:45.950" style="s2">that they don&#39;t fully understand until</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.070" end="01:05:48.700" style="s2">it starts to unfold itself through time</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.950" end="01:05:53.390" style="s2">so yeah your sense of self is</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.700" end="01:06:00.680" style="s2">dramatically changed I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.390" end="01:06:04.580" style="s2">things that right now in in my own in my</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.680" end="01:06:05.810" style="s2">own practice I get moments and again</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.580" end="01:06:08.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like wait we&#39;re talked about</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.810" end="01:06:09.950" style="s2">earlier you don&#39;t you put them into</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.360" end="01:06:11.690" style="s2">words and they won&#39;t sound deep enough</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.950" end="01:06:14.210" style="s2">for resonance enough that the person has</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.690" end="01:06:21.340" style="s2">to be in that world right thoughts wrong</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.210" end="01:06:24.110" style="s2">there I get moments where so so you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.340" end="01:06:26.450" style="s2">most most prominent you know egocentric</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.110" end="01:06:29.060" style="s2">everything is self referential you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.450" end="01:06:30.830" style="s2">I&#39;m self importantly import to take in</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.060" end="01:06:33.680" style="s2">self important of all that stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.830" end="01:06:36.650" style="s2">then you get moments I have moments</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.680" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">where I&#39;m aunt eccentric I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.650" end="01:06:43.340" style="s2">centered right on our realness I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:44.839" style="s2">centered on that realization being real</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.340" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">the way you talked about it which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.839" end="01:06:49.729" style="s2">not the same thing as the inflation of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:52.549" style="s2">the ego and you get you get moments</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.729" end="01:06:56.630" style="s2">where you taste the release from that</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.549" end="01:06:58.969" style="s2">sort of you know that that fever longer</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.630" end="01:07:00.170" style="s2">framing that we&#39;re in all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.969" end="01:07:02.299" style="s2">we don&#39;t even realize it</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.170" end="01:07:04.849" style="s2">but we get release from it in moments of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.299" end="01:07:10.309" style="s2">flow or in these kinds of experiences</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.849" end="01:07:13.670" style="s2">and you get a sense of a way of being a</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.309" end="01:07:16.219" style="s2">self that&#39;s not and this sounds like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.670" end="01:07:19.130" style="s2">contradiction and that&#39;s probably very</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.219" end="01:07:22.249" style="s2">telling a way of being yourself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.130" end="01:07:26.539" style="s2">not fundamentally egocentric but Anto</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.249" end="01:07:27.979" style="s2">centric and I get us you get that sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.539" end="01:07:30.259" style="s2">of you know Nirvana means to blow out</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.979" end="01:07:34.039" style="s2">you know the flame you get a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.259" end="01:07:36.049" style="s2">like it&#39;s like you get a wave of relief</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.039" end="01:07:41.259" style="s2">and release that passes through your</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.049" end="01:07:45.259" style="s2">entire being oh I think I get a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.259" end="01:07:47.150" style="s2">but what how it could be and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.259" end="01:07:52.039" style="s2">encouraging again it&#39;s very aspirational</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.150" end="01:07:53.839" style="s2">II motivated so yeah I think no you</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.039" end="01:07:55.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just dump that into people</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.839" end="01:07:57.829" style="s2">like you don&#39;t just take a novice and</p>

<p begin="01:08:15.950" end="01:08:22.400" style="s2">the beauties of working I guess close to</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.940" end="01:08:24.859" style="s2">the earth or with nature nature so</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.400" end="01:08:27.830" style="s2">honest you can&#39;t really skip steps you</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.859" end="01:08:32.589" style="s2">know yeah requires grounded literally</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.830" end="01:08:38.509" style="s2">right so yeah the yeah so it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.589" end="01:08:40.520" style="s2">being the self the self idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.509" end="01:08:42.650" style="s2">talking about just this emergent thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.520" end="01:08:44.750" style="s2">it kind of depends on where you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.650" end="01:08:46.609" style="s2">place this imaginary bound to be or</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.750" end="01:08:47.779" style="s2">distinction in a sense of what do you</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.609" end="01:08:49.299" style="s2">want to include it or what do you need</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.779" end="01:08:52.909" style="s2">to include in that moment and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.299" end="01:08:54.739" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s boundaries around</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.909" end="01:08:56.690" style="s2">well I mean we didn&#39;t get to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.739" end="01:08:58.339" style="s2">it but I but this sort of deep process</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.690" end="01:08:58.639" style="s2">of relevance realization what&#39;s inside</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.339" end="01:09:01.309" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.639" end="01:09:03.079" style="s2">frame what&#39;s outside my how it moves</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.309" end="01:09:04.849" style="s2">around and you know and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.079" end="01:09:07.309" style="s2">mysterious aspects to me I can&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.849" end="01:09:10.729" style="s2">bring the framing process itself fully</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.309" end="01:09:12.259" style="s2">into bite my frame and you know my</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.729" end="01:09:14.119" style="s2">framing of the world as you said is</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.259" end="01:09:21.859" style="s2">constantly being challenged by the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.119" end="01:09:23.659" style="s2">and opened up yeah and so when we go</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.859" end="01:09:25.989" style="s2">through altered states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.659" end="01:09:28.399" style="s2">that lead to alter traits of character</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.989" end="01:09:31.159" style="s2">the fundamental ways in which were</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.399" end="01:09:33.349" style="s2">framing the world but we find relevant</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.159" end="01:09:35.029" style="s2">and salient what we Center on on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.349" end="01:09:37.399" style="s2">egocentric the aunt eccentric for</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.029" end="01:09:40.429" style="s2">example that shift around and I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.399" end="01:09:42.229" style="s2">that if what I said is true if the felt</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.429" end="01:09:43.969" style="s2">if the self is fundamentally the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.229" end="01:09:46.849" style="s2">we&#39;re in a coupled fashion</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.969" end="01:09:48.769" style="s2">self-organizing then that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.849" end="01:09:51.109" style="s2">it is for the self to be changed that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.769" end="01:09:54.049" style="s2">that process of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.109" end="01:09:56.229" style="s2">and framing like has been fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.049" end="01:09:58.999" style="s2">fundamental framing has been</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.229" end="01:10:00.889" style="s2">fundamentally transformed and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.999" end="01:10:03.530" style="s2">well it is for the sense of self to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.889" end="01:10:05.329" style="s2">altered that&#39;s perfect I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.530" end="01:10:07.249" style="s2">that&#39;s a beautiful place to stop right</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.329" end="01:10:14.030" style="s2">there they that&#39;s some will chew on</p>
