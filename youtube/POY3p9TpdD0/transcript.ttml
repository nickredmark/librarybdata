<p begin="00:03:42.060" end="00:03:46.440" style="s2">on that she does argue though and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.980" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">agree with this argument that aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">must be considered a form of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:51.810" style="s2">which he calls proleptic rationality</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.790" end="00:03:52.890" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to get a you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:03:58.890" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">not themselves rational processes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">kind of in in in trouble in my model of</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">philosophy what&#39;s missing as I argued is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.610" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">an extensive psychology of aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">and I know one of my colleagues Jenson</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:21.570" style="s2">Kim is working on exactly that problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:23.480" style="s2">and he&#39;s of course doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.570" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">connection with a psychology of wisdom I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.480" end="00:04:30.390" style="s2">did suggest to you that we could see one</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">of coloureds ideas of how we do this by</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.390" end="00:04:34.650" style="s2">right we create something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">double-faced or I argued ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.650" end="00:04:38.850" style="s2">symbolic having aspects of gnosis in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:42.420" style="s2">that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.850" end="00:04:45.390" style="s2">make the the jump the leap even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.420" end="00:04:47.550" style="s2">an incremental one right from who we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.390" end="00:04:49.620" style="s2">now and what we value now to the place</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.550" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">where I&#39;ve acquired some new thing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.620" end="00:04:55.170" style="s2">I value for its own sake we use the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.180" end="00:04:57.030" style="s2">example of music appreciation or etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.170" end="00:04:59.670" style="s2">alright</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.030" end="00:05:02.090" style="s2">but unlike colored I see that as</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.670" end="00:05:05.480" style="s2">inherently relying on our symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.090" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">capacity or capacity for enacted</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.480" end="00:05:12.900" style="s2">symbolic behavior what I call gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.710" end="00:05:14.340" style="s2">serious play and because I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.900" end="00:05:16.200" style="s2">serious play it&#39;s always like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.340" end="00:05:18.090" style="s2">playing with something I&#39;m treating it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.200" end="00:05:20.670" style="s2">as for example a sword but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.090" end="00:05:22.770" style="s2">a piece of plastic that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.670" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">serious play that symbolic ability</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.770" end="00:05:27.030" style="s2">especially the enacted one that gives me</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:29.760" style="s2">an agave and analodjica that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.030" end="00:05:33.030" style="s2">important I would also argue for</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.760" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">aspiration at least for the placeholders</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.030" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">that do important work within aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:40.920" style="s2">I also argued that aspiration also</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:43.080" style="s2">probably has an affective component to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.920" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">it and I suggested that wonder and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.080" end="00:05:48.210" style="s2">saw how central wonder is to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:51.300" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom that wonder is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.210" end="00:05:54.060" style="s2">is the is the affective state that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.300" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">most conducive to aspirational progress</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.060" end="00:05:57.630" style="s2">because of the way it opens up right</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:05:59.760" style="s2">entity in our world triggers the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.630" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">transgender relationship and puts it</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.760" end="00:06:04.460" style="s2">into right that participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:07.290" style="s2">puts it into a developmental trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.460" end="00:06:10.830" style="s2">so all of that needs to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.290" end="00:06:12.390" style="s2">together into an account of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.830" end="00:06:15.660" style="s2">then I suggested to you drawing it all</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.390" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">together is that wisdom is an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.660" end="00:06:21.870" style="s2">psycho technologies slash cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:24.090" style="s2">styles right that dynamically and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.870" end="00:06:26.340" style="s2">means recipient recipient reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.090" end="00:06:28.980" style="s2">reciprocal optimization that dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.340" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">enhances the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.980" end="00:06:34.350" style="s2">that&#39;s central to inference to insight</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.540" style="s2">and intuition to internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.350" end="00:06:40.980" style="s2">especially internalizing this age to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.540" end="00:06:43.200" style="s2">understanding and gnosis and related to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.980" end="00:06:46.500" style="s2">gnosis to the relevance realization at</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.500" end="00:06:53.570" style="s2">transformative experience and aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.060" end="00:06:57.560" style="s2">and then I already noted to you that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.570" end="00:06:59.540" style="s2">that enhancement that way in which I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.790" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">enlightenment was to create a</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:03.979" style="s2">enlightenment that what wisdom is doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.030" end="00:08:08.900" style="s2">in order to enhance meaning in life is</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.979" end="00:08:12.169" style="s2">it&#39;s enhancing religio so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.900" end="00:08:14.590" style="s2">wisdom here right and I&#39;m sort of saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.169" end="00:08:21.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a significant overlap with</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.590" end="00:08:23.150" style="s2">enlightenment and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.050" end="00:08:25.790" style="s2">wisdom is doing that&#39;s also really</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.150" end="00:08:31.160" style="s2">important right is it&#39;s enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.790" end="00:08:32.870" style="s2">religio that&#39;s a way in which it can</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.160" end="00:08:34.580" style="s2">powerfully and we saw already the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.870" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">connection remember our delt the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.580" end="00:08:39.349" style="s2">connection to agape right it&#39;s enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:42.020" style="s2">religion and I would say that the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.349" end="00:08:44.510" style="s2">enhancement of religio is already and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.020" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">and remember the the role of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.510" end="00:08:50.870" style="s2">potentially even ah here it&#39;s taking us</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:54.050" style="s2">into sacredness the notion of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.870" end="00:08:56.870" style="s2">that I already have argued and</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.870" end="00:09:05.390" style="s2">and so given this connection all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.010" end="00:09:09.560" style="s2">so this is how its enhancing meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.390" end="00:09:11.420" style="s2">life and of course this is also an</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.560" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">enhancement these are all connected is</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.420" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:23.510" style="s2">it&#39;s enhancing sacredness I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:26.420" style="s2">plausible therefore to argue not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.510" end="00:09:28.460" style="s2">conclude decisively but to argue that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.420" end="00:09:30.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve shown i&#39;ve explicate it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.460" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">explained the deep connections between</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.190" end="00:09:47.960" style="s2">sacredness I want to draw that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.210" end="00:09:51.310" style="s2">altogether right in this notion of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.590" end="00:10:16.030" style="s2">of enlightenment I think if the wise</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.330" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">cultivation of enlightenment is situated</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.030" end="00:10:30.020" style="s2">within two things right if it&#39;s situated</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">within a worldview that affords world</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.020" end="00:10:34.460" style="s2">view attunement if it&#39;s situated within</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.460" end="00:10:40.130" style="s2">throughout consistently I believe at</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.090" end="00:10:55.580" style="s2">a naturalistic explanation right so and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.760" end="00:10:56.990" style="s2">we&#39;ve already argued how for cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.580" end="00:10:58.340" style="s2">science third-generation cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.990" end="00:11:01.130" style="s2">science can give us this worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.340" end="00:11:04.580" style="s2">and notice how much the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.130" end="00:11:06.950" style="s2">wisdom was invoking a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.580" end="00:11:09.110" style="s2">the theoretical machinery that we got</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.950" end="00:11:15.050" style="s2">from third generation for a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:19.580" style="s2">science was all through it okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.050" end="00:11:23.480" style="s2">is situated into a basically an enabling</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.580" end="00:11:27.650" style="s2">and encouraging worldview and that it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.480" end="00:11:30.200" style="s2">also situated within some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.650" end="00:11:39.470" style="s2">I suggested where we have a co-opt</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.200" end="00:11:41.560" style="s2">network of communities of practice let</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.439" end="00:12:07.589" style="s2">and I already talked about what that is</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.069" end="00:12:20.339" style="s2">wisdom wiki and this has both a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:22.139" style="s2">like there&#39;s researchers like the</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.550" end="00:13:31.500" style="s2">we can awaken from the meeting crisis I</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.720" end="00:13:57.990" style="s2">of socio-cultural framework I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.170" end="00:14:00.750" style="s2">that&#39;s how we can individually and</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.500" end="00:14:18.600" style="s2">can be engineered from within a secular</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:21.480" style="s2">scientific worldview it&#39;s not a view</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.540" end="00:17:31.060" style="s2">chosen for two reasons I&#39;ve chosen them</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.490" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">because I think I have some relevant</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.700" end="00:17:55.310" style="s2">network of people I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.670" end="00:17:57.560" style="s2">their dinners are in a sense harbingers</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.310" end="00:17:58.940" style="s2">of the meaning crisis but again in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.560" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">prophetic sense they&#39;re trying to awaken</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:03.770" style="s2">us and arouse us to respond so what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:06.140" style="s2">want to do is first of all put up what</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.770" end="00:18:11.060" style="s2">that network is going to look like to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.140" end="00:18:14.660" style="s2">give you an overarching roadmap of where</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.060" end="00:18:17.300" style="s2">we&#39;re going an overarching roadmap of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.660" end="00:18:18.200" style="s2">where we&#39;re going and then what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.300" end="00:18:20.120" style="s2">going to be doing throughout is</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.200" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">presenting that material and then as I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.120" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">said trying to put it into constructive</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:28.430" style="s2">dialogue with the argument I have made</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:32.900" style="s2">my attempt is not to sort of say that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.430" end="00:18:33.980" style="s2">they are all the my account is better or</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.900" end="00:18:38.710" style="s2">they&#39;re all just saying what I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.980" end="00:18:42.110" style="s2">saying but what I want to show is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.710" end="00:18:43.850" style="s2">the account I&#39;ve made can be I can argue</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.110" end="00:18:47.150" style="s2">that it is deeply responsive and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.850" end="00:18:52.070" style="s2">responsible to the work of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.150" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">prophets of the meaning crisis so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.070" end="00:18:56.930" style="s2">figure that it&#39;s and he is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:18:59.540" style="s2">controversial figure and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.930" end="00:19:01.820" style="s2">fair to say my philosophical attitude</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.540" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">towards him is one of ambivalence but</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.820" end="00:19:08.630" style="s2">sort of a pivotal figure in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:10.460" style="s2">is Heidegger so I want to take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.630" end="00:19:11.810" style="s2">Heidegger right now I&#39;m not going into</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.460" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">discussing these people I want to draw</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.810" end="00:19:18.470" style="s2">out some important connections we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:20.120" style="s2">have to go behind Heidegger a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.470" end="00:19:23.630" style="s2">and talk about hosts role and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.120" end="00:19:28.010" style="s2">phenomenology and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.630" end="00:19:30.950" style="s2">Heidegger is I would argue also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.010" end="00:19:32.990" style="s2">influenced by sort of the the the gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.950" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">underground running through Germany</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.990" end="00:19:39.590" style="s2">especially in the 20th century and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:42.710" style="s2">especially like between the wars and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.590" end="00:19:44.180" style="s2">that comes through at least explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.710" end="00:19:45.680" style="s2">and you can see this in John Caputo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.180" end="00:19:47.900" style="s2">book on the mystical element and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.680" end="00:19:51.320" style="s2">Heidegger thought this comes through the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.900" end="00:19:57.170" style="s2">Rhineland mystic of meister eckhart has</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.320" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">a huge impact on on Heidegger so so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.170" end="00:20:05.480" style="s2">those are definitely important aspects</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.860" style="s2">important influences another of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.480" end="00:20:09.110" style="s2">titanically important because he just</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.860" end="00:20:15.740" style="s2">influences everybody is caught and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.110" end="00:20:16.760" style="s2">behind count of course is Descartes so</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.740" end="00:20:18.830" style="s2">many of these people I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.760" end="00:20:20.360" style="s2">have to I&#39;m not going to talk about at</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.830" end="00:20:22.100" style="s2">length because I&#39;ve already talked but</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.360" end="00:20:23.390" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to map this out because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.100" end="00:20:24.440" style="s2">trying to show you what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.390" end="00:20:27.530" style="s2">invoke and then what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.440" end="00:20:34.520" style="s2">discuss in order to try and draw this</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.530" end="00:20:35.630" style="s2">all together so another really important</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.520" end="00:20:38.510" style="s2">figure and you&#39;ve heard me mention him</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.630" end="00:20:41.060" style="s2">several times and he directly gets into</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.510" end="00:20:43.160" style="s2">that connection with theology but he is</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.060" end="00:20:48.020" style="s2">one of the I think one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.160" end="00:20:50.630" style="s2">writers about the meaning crisis is of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.020" end="00:20:54.980" style="s2">course Paul Tillich and his masterpiece</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.630" end="00:20:57.710" style="s2">the courage to be is all about you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.980" end="00:21:00.410" style="s2">a prophetic announcement of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.710" end="00:21:05.660" style="s2">crisis and an attempt to seriously</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.410" end="00:21:08.900" style="s2">revise you know theology to take that</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.660" end="00:21:11.270" style="s2">into account and there&#39;s also and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.900" end="00:21:13.580" style="s2">think both this way and it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.270" end="00:21:16.340" style="s2">if it&#39;s also independently but there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.580" end="00:21:17.930" style="s2">Gnostic element deeply Gnostic elements</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.340" end="00:21:19.490" style="s2">so I&#39;ll put that is sort of a dotted</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.930" end="00:21:23.250" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.490" end="00:21:25.529" style="s2">in Tillich Tillich famously argues that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.250" end="00:21:27.960" style="s2">we need to get to the God beyond the God</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.529" end="00:21:31.460" style="s2">of theism which is about a gnostic a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.960" end="00:21:31.460" style="s2">statement as you could possibly make</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.149" end="00:21:41.179" style="s2">so Heidegger also has a lot of influence</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:44.580" style="s2">on somebody you&#39;ve heard me mention</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.179" end="00:21:47.000" style="s2">especially with ideas of trans jacked it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.580" end="00:21:49.769" style="s2">but he has a lot to say about symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.000" end="00:21:53.340" style="s2">and the meeting crisis and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.769" end="00:21:55.350" style="s2">Corbin and so I&#39;m gonna have to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.340" end="00:21:57.960" style="s2">lot about Corbin because I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.350" end="00:22:01.080" style="s2">discussed him at length but his work is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.960" end="00:22:02.490" style="s2">again very pivotal in trying to respond</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.080" end="00:22:04.710" style="s2">to the meeting crisis and the work that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.490" end="00:22:07.110" style="s2">Chatham has done at trying in his</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.710" end="00:22:10.710" style="s2">trilogy of books or maybe there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.110" end="00:22:11.879" style="s2">books maybe but I&#39;ve read three I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.710" end="00:22:15.450" style="s2">read two and I&#39;m currently reading the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.879" end="00:22:17.970" style="s2">third books on Corbin really helped to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.450" end="00:22:20.549" style="s2">make a good case for how important it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.970" end="00:22:22.289" style="s2">many people don&#39;t know about for example</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.549" end="00:22:24.649" style="s2">the deep connections between somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.289" end="00:22:28.289" style="s2">else that we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.649" end="00:22:30.899" style="s2">Corbin and Yonge and of course Jung is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.289" end="00:22:34.820" style="s2">directly influenced by the Gnostics and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.899" end="00:22:34.820" style="s2">directly influenced by Conte</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:41.429" style="s2">this allows me to bring out another</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.590" end="00:22:46.700" style="s2">important connection which is the work</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.429" end="00:22:51.389" style="s2">of Dooley because what he does which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.700" end="00:22:55.139" style="s2">really impressive right is he shows the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.389" end="00:22:58.860" style="s2">deep similarities between Tillich and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.139" end="00:23:01.049" style="s2">Jung no doubt because of their sharing</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.860" end="00:23:04.230" style="s2">well I&#39;m arguing the sharing of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.049" end="00:23:07.710" style="s2">gnosis background I would also argue</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.230" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">that both Tillich and Jung are an</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.710" end="00:23:12.299" style="s2">important sense non theists and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:15.240" style="s2">talk about what non-theism is as we get</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.299" end="00:23:16.889" style="s2">into that but the one of the core shared</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:18.600" style="s2">idea and this is actually the title of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.889" end="00:23:22.019" style="s2">one under Lee&#39;s book is the psyche as</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.600" end="00:23:25.710" style="s2">sacrament both Tillich and Jung view the</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.710" end="00:23:29.879" style="s2">is part of the way in which they attempt</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.260" end="00:23:32.220" style="s2">to respond to the meaning crisis both of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.879" end="00:23:37.129" style="s2">them have profound things to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.220" end="00:23:39.980" style="s2">about about symbols and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.129" end="00:23:45.379" style="s2">to the spiritual life broadly construed</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.980" end="00:23:49.409" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to talk about young now</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.379" end="00:23:54.779" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s also here directly</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.409" end="00:23:58.440" style="s2">influenced by gnosis influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.779" end="00:24:00.149" style="s2">caught through the romantics which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.440" end="00:24:04.789" style="s2">talked about at least the early German</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.149" end="00:24:09.629" style="s2">romantics people like Slagel for example</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.789" end="00:24:11.879" style="s2">and therefore through Coolridge right</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.629" end="00:24:16.350" style="s2">and the person I&#39;m drawing in here this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.879" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">is going to be Barfield and you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.350" end="00:24:22.500" style="s2">me mention him a couple times and bar</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:24.779" style="s2">fields notions of participation have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.500" end="00:24:28.700" style="s2">lot to say so you can see how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.779" end="00:24:32.429" style="s2">there there&#39;s sort of a network here and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.700" end="00:24:36.870" style="s2">then there&#39;s there&#39;s another one that of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.429" end="00:24:38.370" style="s2">course we need to talk about and this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.870" end="00:24:41.639" style="s2">the connection between Heidegger and</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.000" end="00:24:49.649" style="s2">post-modernism as if everybody who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.149" end="00:24:54.929" style="s2">post modernist were saying the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.649" end="00:24:57.419" style="s2">thing we should more carefully look at</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.320" end="00:25:06.110" style="s2">is we&#39;ll take a look at it Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.350" end="00:25:11.250" style="s2">now whether or not we should call the</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.030" end="00:27:02.140" style="s2">influence is also Buddhism and you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:39.260" style="s2">I have not yet put it into</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.980" end="00:27:40.790" style="s2">the Twitter record book recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.260" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">I&#39;ve recommended the kyouda school and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.790" end="00:27:44.690" style="s2">some of Robert Carter&#39;s excellent work</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:48.020" style="s2">introducing you to these people directly</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.690" end="00:27:49.130" style="s2">reading nishitani is very difficult you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.020" end="00:27:52.600" style="s2">need to know</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.130" end="00:27:56.090" style="s2">Heidegger well James well Buddhism well</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.600" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">alright and then the Kyoto School people</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.090" end="00:27:59.780" style="s2">and I won&#39;t talk about like Maserati</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:02.630" style="s2">they they put this into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.780" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">people like Tillich and Whitehead so</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.630" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">this is what I want to try and address</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:16.370" style="s2">again I will be giving some of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:20.179" style="s2">people much more priority I only have</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.370" end="00:28:23.870" style="s2">four four lectures left after this so</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.179" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">right four hours so I&#39;ll be giving some</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.870" end="00:28:28.280" style="s2">people much more priority than others</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:33.620" style="s2">obviously Heidegger is taking a a</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.280" end="00:28:35.140" style="s2">central role here but we&#39;ll we will be</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.620" end="00:28:38.530" style="s2">spending quite a bit of time with</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.140" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">Barfield young Corvin and Tillich and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.530" end="00:28:42.919" style="s2">with nishitani okay so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:44.809" style="s2">ones that I&#39;m gonna give priority to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.919" end="00:28:50.929" style="s2">these other people I&#39;ll try to do my</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.809" end="00:28:52.669" style="s2">best to represent them but I will have</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.929" end="00:28:55.190" style="s2">to prioritize I want to keep my</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.669" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">commitment to you that I finished this</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.190" end="00:29:03.040" style="s2">in the 50 episodes I also do not want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:05.809" style="s2">drag my video crew through some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.040" end="00:29:07.160" style="s2">video version of a death march until</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.809" end="00:29:12.350" style="s2">they are exhausted beyond all</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.160" end="00:29:14.330" style="s2">recognition so where to start on here</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.350" end="00:29:20.150" style="s2">well I&#39;m going to start at the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.330" end="00:29:21.710" style="s2">center so this is very complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.150" end="00:29:24.110" style="s2">this is not meant to be an explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.710" end="00:29:26.299" style="s2">schema this is meant to be a road map to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.110" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">show you where I&#39;m going how are things</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.299" end="00:29:31.780" style="s2">connected you can take this down and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:35.059" style="s2">like I said then you can use this to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.780" end="00:29:38.650" style="s2">retrace the connections as I try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.059" end="00:29:38.650" style="s2">explicate and explain them</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.360" end="00:29:55.970" style="s2">all right so before we get to Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.350" end="00:29:57.500" style="s2">we have to talk about I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.970" end="00:29:59.510" style="s2">talk about Eckhart and the rhineland</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.500" end="00:30:02.809" style="s2">mystics because I&#39;ve already done that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.510" end="00:30:05.960" style="s2">or gnosis because I&#39;ve already done that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.809" end="00:30:09.080" style="s2">quite extensively right or caught</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.960" end="00:30:11.570" style="s2">because I&#39;ve done that but when a person</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.080" end="00:30:13.820" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t discussed but it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.570" end="00:30:17.480" style="s2">Titanic influence on Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.820" end="00:30:20.659" style="s2">Husserl Edmund Husserl and who&#39;s well of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.480" end="00:30:23.809" style="s2">course is famous for founding a whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.659" end="00:30:30.500" style="s2">philosophical movement called</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.809" end="00:30:33.320" style="s2">phenomenology existentialism comes out</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.500" end="00:30:35.289" style="s2">of phenomenology via Heidegger by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.320" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">way that&#39;s when you get existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.289" end="00:30:39.260" style="s2">Heidegger does something to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:41.769" style="s2">phenomenology and it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.260" end="00:30:43.940" style="s2">existentialism but it also leads to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.769" end="00:30:45.769" style="s2">deconstructionism post-modernism bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.940" end="00:30:50.149" style="s2">bla bla I&#39;ve already pointed out now</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.769" end="00:30:52.370" style="s2">again you need an entire course to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.149" end="00:30:54.380" style="s2">clear about what phenomenology is I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.370" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">really recommend the introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.380" end="00:31:05.000" style="s2">phenomenology by Sokolowski Sokolowski</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:08.210" style="s2">and the book experimental phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.000" end="00:31:10.970" style="s2">by Don ID this is sort of gives you an</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.210" end="00:31:13.190" style="s2">idea right of what phenomenology is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.970" end="00:31:15.740" style="s2">very good very clear-eyed and this gives</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.190" end="00:31:17.539" style="s2">you sort of ways of practicing some</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.740" end="00:31:20.029" style="s2">phenomenological techniques to get a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.539" end="00:31:26.120" style="s2">more inside feel of what phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.029" end="00:31:28.190" style="s2">is like now phenomenology and hustled</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.120" end="00:31:29.809" style="s2">even writes a book where he invokes the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.190" end="00:31:33.860" style="s2">word crisis of crisis and European</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.809" end="00:31:37.100" style="s2">sciences right phenomenology was host</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.860" end="00:31:40.580" style="s2">Earl&#39;s attempt to try and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.100" end="00:31:42.710" style="s2">the following thing the it&#39;s an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.580" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">to try and get us back to a contact</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.330" end="00:31:51.529" style="s2">phenomenological tradition like Dreyfus</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.070" end="00:31:53.330" style="s2">and Taylor talking about the loss of a</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:58.549" style="s2">aware of the idea of a contact</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.950" end="00:32:01.190" style="s2">epistemology I would argue from their</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.549" end="00:32:02.990" style="s2">phenomenological heritage what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.190" end="00:32:03.580" style="s2">famously argued about getting back to</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.850" end="00:32:12.130" style="s2">and removed we had lost contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.270" end="00:32:14.830" style="s2">world we were out of touch in a profound</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.130" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">way and that&#39;s why phenomenology has had</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.830" end="00:32:18.790" style="s2">such a big influence on those aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:21.310" style="s2">cognitive science that are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.790" end="00:32:25.810" style="s2">show how deeply embedded embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.310" end="00:32:28.990" style="s2">connected we are to the world so the</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.990" end="00:32:37.570" style="s2">epistemology was really central and one</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.660" end="00:32:39.310" style="s2">way of understanding that contact and to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.570" end="00:32:43.380" style="s2">put it into dialogue with the language</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.310" end="00:32:46.590" style="s2">we&#39;ve been using in this course right is</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.380" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">that you get this contact by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:53.020" style="s2">phenomenology shouldn&#39;t be confused with</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:55.210" style="s2">merely introspecting that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.020" end="00:32:57.700" style="s2">everyday or common sense stance the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.210" end="00:32:59.260" style="s2">phenomenological attitude is not the</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.260" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">everyday introspection right instead</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.140" end="00:33:07.930" style="s2">phenomenology is a much more disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:10.870" style="s2">practice in which you&#39;re trying to pay</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.930" end="00:33:15.630" style="s2">reflective and following ID kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.870" end="00:33:22.180" style="s2">experimental attention this probative</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.630" end="00:33:26.920" style="s2">attention to the way in in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.180" end="00:33:29.050" style="s2">in contact with the world so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.920" end="00:33:37.860" style="s2">that what I&#39;m doing in phenomenology is</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.050" end="00:33:37.860" style="s2">I&#39;m playing this reflective experimental</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.940" end="00:33:46.290" style="s2">exploratory probative attention</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.010" end="00:33:53.740" style="s2">attention to contact and then how can we</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.260" end="00:34:00.420" style="s2">understand contact well what his role</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.740" end="00:34:06.210" style="s2">emphasized emphasized intentionality</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.420" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">right that&#39;s one pole of this relation</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.210" end="00:34:14.169" style="s2">okay now I&#39;ve got to explain this</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:16.060" style="s2">normally when we use this word it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.169" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">correct but it&#39;s a species of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.060" end="00:34:19.600" style="s2">broader sense of intentionality when we</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:21.240" style="s2">say you do something intentionally it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.600" end="00:34:24.190" style="s2">means you&#39;re doing it on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.240" end="00:34:25.389" style="s2">intentionality here in phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.190" end="00:34:27.970" style="s2">philosophy in general is much more</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.389" end="00:34:31.270" style="s2">broader it means any mental directedness</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.970" end="00:34:36.129" style="s2">any mental directedness so when my</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.270" end="00:34:39.490" style="s2">perceptions are are of the bottle or my</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.129" end="00:34:42.520" style="s2">actions are towards the book right or</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.490" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about Paris those are all</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.520" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">intentionality in that I have a mental</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:48.760" style="s2">directedness so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">intentionality and it&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.760" end="00:34:53.710" style="s2">reciprocal relationship with the way in</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">which a world is disclosed we&#39;re a world</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.710" end="00:35:01.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean a planet it means something</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:06.100" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been talking about throughout</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.560" end="00:35:08.710" style="s2">right it means a meaningfully structured</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.100" end="00:35:10.420" style="s2">environment a meaningfully structured</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.710" end="00:35:15.400" style="s2">environment what I&#39;ve tried to often</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.420" end="00:35:17.860" style="s2">capture by this notion of an arena this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.400" end="00:35:19.630" style="s2">is kind of a core kind of agency this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.860" end="00:35:22.900" style="s2">at least mental agency this mental</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.630" end="00:35:26.050" style="s2">directedness so and this is important</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.900" end="00:35:31.360" style="s2">this is how did you use the word noesis</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.050" end="00:35:33.340" style="s2">here for this and the new EEMA is here</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.360" end="00:35:35.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s of course all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.340" end="00:35:38.680" style="s2">debates about what this does this refer</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.320" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">to just something in my consciousness or</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.680" end="00:35:44.590" style="s2">something in the world that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:47.260" style="s2">to come back to some of this we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.590" end="00:35:49.210" style="s2">come back to it when in order to get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.260" end="00:35:50.770" style="s2">Harman and we are going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.210" end="00:35:53.140" style="s2">Sparrows critique of phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.770" end="00:35:55.090" style="s2">because he&#39;s going to argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.140" end="00:35:58.130" style="s2">very goal of phenomenology which was to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.090" end="00:36:00.460" style="s2">get back into contact with reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.130" end="00:36:06.109" style="s2">and therefore to be a kind of realism is</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.460" end="00:36:07.940" style="s2">forted by this this set up so he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.109" end="00:36:10.460" style="s2">argue that phenomenology ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.940" end="00:36:12.140" style="s2">fails as a form of realism and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.460" end="00:36:14.509" style="s2">ultimately a kind of idealism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.140" end="00:36:17.269" style="s2">therefore doesn&#39;t give us what it</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.509" end="00:36:22.059" style="s2">purported to do we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.269" end="00:36:28.430" style="s2">that&#39;s just some forewarning</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.059" end="00:36:31.099" style="s2">what I would argue using this is what</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.430" end="00:36:33.470" style="s2">phenomenology using what I mean by this</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.099" end="00:36:35.299" style="s2">is the language and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.470" end="00:36:37.759" style="s2">conceptual vocabulary in theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.299" end="00:36:40.099" style="s2">grammar we&#39;ve developed together using</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.759" end="00:36:42.950" style="s2">that I would describe phenomenology as</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.099" end="00:36:46.630" style="s2">this reflective experimental exploratory</p>

<p begin="00:36:55.460" end="00:36:59.900" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.660" end="00:37:02.509" style="s2">this is prospective unknowing so putting</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.900" end="00:37:06.109" style="s2">it together it&#39;s this reflective meaning</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.509" end="00:37:08.839" style="s2">all of these it&#39;s this reflective</p>

<p begin="00:37:53.900" end="00:38:00.170" style="s2">want to do now into speculative realism</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:07.299" style="s2">Heidegger do with this well</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.490" end="00:38:13.770" style="s2">my way of putting this that I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.710" end="00:38:18.570" style="s2">draws together two of its criticisms is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.770" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">to well know maybe a better way let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.570" end="00:38:21.540" style="s2">the two criticism then draw them</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:23.550" style="s2">together one of heidegger&#39;s main</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.540" end="00:38:25.110" style="s2">criticism is that hugs will work and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.550" end="00:38:28.860" style="s2">that this is going to be developed by</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.110" end="00:38:31.020" style="s2">Sparrow and the speculative realists is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.860" end="00:38:35.700" style="s2">that hustlers work had not really given</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.020" end="00:38:37.800" style="s2">us contact now one way I would put it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.700" end="00:38:39.540" style="s2">because it had not really developed an</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.800" end="00:38:42.060" style="s2">account of participatory knowing it had</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.540" end="00:38:44.750" style="s2">not really developed an account of how</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.060" end="00:38:47.340" style="s2">the agent and the arena were</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.750" end="00:38:49.860" style="s2">fundamentally related together so that</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.860" end="00:38:56.220" style="s2">unfold now I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.160" end="00:38:59.610" style="s2">for all of phenomenology I would make</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.220" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">the case that Marlowe pontes I and we</p>

<p begin="00:44:55.409" end="00:45:03.390" style="s2">insofar I would argue as we are persons</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:05.279" style="s2">are who and what we are whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.390" end="00:45:07.319" style="s2">it means sense to call it our essence</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.279" end="00:45:10.949" style="s2">because essence should be a widely</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.829" end="00:45:44.789" style="s2">are that&#39;s what existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.479" end="00:45:50.159" style="s2">ultimately points to that your existence</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.789" end="00:45:51.719" style="s2">precedes your essence that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.719" end="00:46:00.599" style="s2">of Heidegger but the key idea is that</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.069" end="00:46:12.150" style="s2">I mean we can sort of do philosophy on</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.140" end="00:46:13.640" style="s2">it but there&#39;s from within phenomenology</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.900" end="00:51:18.490" style="s2">why he&#39;s Heidegger there&#39;s brilliant</p>

<p begin="00:51:21.010" end="00:51:31.000" style="s2">the contact by phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.280" end="00:51:35.730" style="s2">exploring this so that&#39;s really central</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.000" end="00:51:35.730" style="s2">to what Heidegger is trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.030" end="00:51:40.630" style="s2">reading Heidegger is very hard because</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.290" end="00:51:44.130" style="s2">it&#39;s filled with all this neologisms</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.630" end="00:51:47.830" style="s2">it&#39;s filled with all of this constant</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.130" end="00:51:49.890" style="s2">right qualifying with this constant</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.830" end="00:51:53.140" style="s2">self-criticism which of course is good</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.890" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">this constant refinement but also this</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.140" end="00:51:59.619" style="s2">this constant acknowledgment statement</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:02.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s not quite getting it we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.619" end="00:52:05.230" style="s2">getting the answer so it there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.680" end="00:52:09.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like going on the walk</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.230" end="00:52:10.570" style="s2">through a really gnarled forest with</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.160" end="00:52:12.849" style="s2">somebody if this is a metaphor that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.570" end="00:52:14.770" style="s2">Heidegger himself would use and you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.849" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">a sense of progress but it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.770" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">if you&#39;re actually making progress you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:21.670" style="s2">you come into clearings and you you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">openings an insight but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.670" end="00:52:26.170" style="s2">also but yet we haven&#39;t arrived we</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:29.830" style="s2">haven&#39;t arrived until you go on again</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.170" end="00:52:34.270" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this long process so what</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.830" end="00:52:37.510" style="s2">I want to do instead with you is instead</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.270" end="00:52:38.770" style="s2">of trying to do something audacious to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.510" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">try to summer I want to try and go in</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.770" end="00:52:44.050" style="s2">and get some I&#39;m going to do some</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:46.450" style="s2">exposition with you I want to read some</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.050" end="00:52:49.440" style="s2">key quotes from Heidegger and what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.450" end="00:52:52.119" style="s2">then want to do is try and unpack them</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.440" end="00:52:55.450" style="s2">following this idea of how he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.119" end="00:52:58.750" style="s2">to deepen contact trying to put into</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.450" end="00:53:02.440" style="s2">dialogue with the very tremendous help</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.750" end="00:53:05.400" style="s2">of Dreyfuss with the machinery the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.440" end="00:53:07.990" style="s2">theoretical machinery we have developed</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.400" end="00:53:11.109" style="s2">and also along and that will also afford</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.990" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">me a critical response to Heidegger I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.109" end="00:53:15.460" style="s2">not going to start those quotes now</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:17.560" style="s2">because we&#39;re almost out of time what I</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.460" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">want to do is just foreshadow what</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.560" end="00:53:23.830" style="s2">Heidegger is going to argue how did</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:24.849" style="s2">there is going to argue that the history</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.830" end="00:53:27.489" style="s2">of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.849" end="00:53:29.799" style="s2">there what that whole philosophical</p>

<p begin="00:53:56.769" end="00:54:01.900" style="s2">already deeply resonant with the</p>
