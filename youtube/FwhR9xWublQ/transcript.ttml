<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">I came to know Andrew Sweeney because of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.190" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">a series of articles about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">Peterson and intellectual dark web he</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">posted on medium those articles there</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">were not only excellently written but</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">also tried to explore the cultural shift</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">in which that movement appeared we both</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.890" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">share the sentiment as a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:22.369" style="s2">do actually that the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:26.550" style="s2">was an important new tribe addressing</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.369" end="00:01:29.160" style="s2">important issues in our culture so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.550" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">invited him to the podcast and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.160" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">chatted a little bit about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:37.800" style="s2">phenomenon about his importance its</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:42.569" style="s2">aspects there&#39;s certainly a lot of more</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.800" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">to say about the ID we then we and did</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.569" end="00:01:49.050" style="s2">cover at this time and I think time will</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">tell if this movement itself has the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.050" end="00:01:54.810" style="s2">ability to actually bring some higher</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">order into the cultural chaos we face</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.810" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">today there are a lot of promises there</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">also a lot of problems and we will see</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:06.270" style="s2">how they are doing for now I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">important to see that there are people</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.270" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">who are actually trying to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">between the problems and fallacies of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:17.370" style="s2">the left and right and their ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">offering new and sometimes old</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.370" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">perspectives and sometimes even</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">integrated grand narratives which seem</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:32.150" style="s2">to have have been lost with post-miranda</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.330" end="00:02:35.069" style="s2">team so I hope you will enjoy this</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.150" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">conversation I will post the links to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.069" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">andrew&#39;s article below the description</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.989" end="00:02:54.140" style="s2">that&#39;s it well it&#39;s interesting like III</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">started to write obsessively about</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.140" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">Jordan Peterson around the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">you did your your first podcast with him</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:03.270" style="s2">I think right I think it&#39;s about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">time I write in the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.270" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">sort of rise to popularity and I started</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:11.400" style="s2">to write about him and and immediately</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:13.500" style="s2">there&#39;s this there was this huge</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.400" end="00:03:17.100" style="s2">polarization between people who just</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.500" end="00:03:19.800" style="s2">hated him you know and then people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.100" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">were not you know it was kind of like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.800" end="00:03:24.840" style="s2">lost a few friends along the way just</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:28.410" style="s2">just by even speaking about him which</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.840" end="00:03:29.640" style="s2">was which was a strange experience for</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.410" end="00:03:31.830" style="s2">me because I always find them to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.640" end="00:03:33.900" style="s2">quite reasonable if anything else you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.830" end="00:03:36.330" style="s2">know yeah I still I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.900" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">understand that phenomenon that like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.330" end="00:03:42.510" style="s2">person who can be so reasonable and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:44.910" style="s2">clear mind it and so articulate could</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.510" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">polarize that much you know it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">something that forwards my mind somehow</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:51.330" style="s2">because when you talk to him or when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">see him in these these lectures or in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.330" end="00:03:59.700" style="s2">this public performances there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:04:01.410" style="s2">I would even consider controversial you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.700" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">know it&#39;s like yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.410" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">yes it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:11.190" style="s2">controversial it&#39;s it&#39;s not right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:14.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not neoconservative it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.190" end="00:04:16.940" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely none of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.100" end="00:04:19.910" style="s2">labels which he gets branded with</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:22.920" style="s2">constantly and consistently and and I I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.910" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">think maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s uh he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.920" end="00:04:28.520" style="s2">man or something and that he&#39;s speaking</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:32.900" style="s2">in a positive way about masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.520" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">there seems to be this enormous wave of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.900" end="00:04:37.110" style="s2">well you know I was reading Newman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:38.850" style="s2">book and he talks about the castrating</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.110" end="00:04:43.500" style="s2">mother or something you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.850" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">asking feminine right so if there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.500" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">sort of you know as soon as a strong and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:51.480" style="s2">assertive male you know presence appears</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:56.010" style="s2">on the scene in the age of Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.480" end="00:05:00.480" style="s2">he he he he&#39;s immediately thought of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.010" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">with suspicion right I like to I like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.480" end="00:05:06.390" style="s2">view a person like Peterson as a as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:09.090" style="s2">indicator or like a symbol for a larger</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.390" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">larger movement a larger social cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.090" end="00:05:13.200" style="s2">movement for example I saw two or three</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">months ago I saw a documentary about</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.200" end="00:05:16.689" style="s2">Picasso you know and and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:19.089" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.689" end="00:05:21.189" style="s2">from this televisions and Arthur I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.089" end="00:05:23.860" style="s2">know if you know it it&#39;s like a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.189" end="00:05:26.979" style="s2">more it&#39;s one of the better channels so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.860" end="00:05:29.319" style="s2">you&#39;re sure yeah so and and there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.979" end="00:05:31.389" style="s2">some experts which were interviewed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.319" end="00:05:35.559" style="s2">they all said well you you couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.389" end="00:05:39.159" style="s2">a discussion about art like from 90 you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.559" end="00:05:42.879" style="s2">like for 80 years without centering the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.159" end="00:05:46.239" style="s2">discussions around Picasso so because</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.879" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s he was a symbol for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.239" end="00:05:51.519" style="s2">whole movement and for development of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:54.729" style="s2">art and stuff like that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.519" end="00:05:57.099" style="s2">it&#39;s like every discussion I have and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.729" end="00:06:02.050" style="s2">lot of discussions about philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.099" end="00:06:04.599" style="s2">where we add in our culture and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.050" end="00:06:06.309" style="s2">always revolving about Rob Peterson you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.599" end="00:06:08.769" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah you know it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.309" end="00:06:11.259" style="s2">focal point of some thing I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.769" end="00:06:14.229" style="s2">what it is I would like to explore this</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.259" end="00:06:17.709" style="s2">kind of thing maybe in this podcast with</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.229" end="00:06:20.439" style="s2">you but I think it is a it is a movement</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.709" end="00:06:23.649" style="s2">it is something more than than just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.439" end="00:06:25.059" style="s2">person you know yeah I did yeah yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.649" end="00:06:27.219" style="s2">know while he&#39;s you know he speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.059" end="00:06:29.800" style="s2">archetypes and he speaks about young and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.219" end="00:06:32.050" style="s2">he speaks about being you know carried</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.800" end="00:06:35.079" style="s2">away and taken by archetypes you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.050" end="00:06:37.689" style="s2">and he is she&#39;s a sort of archetype I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.079" end="00:06:40.899" style="s2">think in a sense or he&#39;s he&#39;s animating</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.689" end="00:06:42.999" style="s2">a kind of an archetype right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.899" end="00:06:44.469" style="s2">like almost the opposite of the Picasso</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.999" end="00:06:46.449" style="s2">archetype that you&#39;re speaking of you</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.469" end="00:06:48.610" style="s2">know because Picasso represents wildness</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.449" end="00:06:51.939" style="s2">you know Picasso represents the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.610" end="00:06:55.959" style="s2">destruction of forms true you know and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.939" end="00:06:58.389" style="s2">and and the dissembling of of the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.959" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">in a sense and and Peterson&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.389" end="00:07:02.169" style="s2">trying to bring it together he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">to bring bring you know order you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.169" end="00:07:05.979" style="s2">but that&#39;s not that&#39;s even that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">sort of a reduction of what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.979" end="00:07:09.519" style="s2">because he talks about the balance</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:11.979" style="s2">between case in order but the weird</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.519" end="00:07:14.469" style="s2">thing about I think his movement is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.979" end="00:07:16.599" style="s2">sort of uh it&#39;s sort of a counter</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.469" end="00:07:20.159" style="s2">movement to all the movements of the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.599" end="00:07:24.219" style="s2">right or all the movements of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.159" end="00:07:26.019" style="s2">let&#39;s say liberation private it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.219" end="00:07:29.439" style="s2">the liberation movements are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.019" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">they&#39;ve reached their maximum in terms</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.439" end="00:07:34.660" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:37.270" style="s2">the structures now and now and now now</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.660" end="00:07:40.750" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of construction taking</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.270" end="00:07:43.090" style="s2">place and he&#39;s sort of he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.750" end="00:07:45.160" style="s2">coming in at that point where you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.090" end="00:07:47.620" style="s2">after after I guess I guess Trump would</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.160" end="00:07:49.540" style="s2">be the maximum of sort of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.620" end="00:07:51.700" style="s2">you know this anomaly president this</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.540" end="00:07:54.130" style="s2">president Trump and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.700" end="00:07:56.260" style="s2">Trump apocalypse and and all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.130" end="00:07:59.650" style="s2">and then and then so so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.260" end="00:08:01.480" style="s2">sort of you have this sort of weird</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.480" end="00:08:06.040" style="s2">world who&#39;s like this weird male figure</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.810" end="00:08:07.870" style="s2">and then and then Peterson&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.040" end="00:08:09.940" style="s2">moves in as being that the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.870" end="00:08:11.830" style="s2">you know positive male role model in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.940" end="00:08:13.690" style="s2">sense as opposed to through the good</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.690" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">opposed to the irresponsible father or</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:24.480" style="s2">archetype the Trump kind of represents</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.700" end="00:08:27.700" style="s2">right yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.480" end="00:08:30.220" style="s2">Picasso would be like the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.700" end="00:08:32.530" style="s2">because I think he made like seventy</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.220" end="00:08:35.590" style="s2">thousand pieces of art and was</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.530" end="00:08:38.020" style="s2">constantly on constantly on the verge of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.590" end="00:08:40.840" style="s2">between chaos and order so to speak him</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.020" end="00:08:43.990" style="s2">and constantly creating so mother the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.840" end="00:08:46.150" style="s2">the archetype of the artist was for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.990" end="00:08:48.400" style="s2">and my perception Peterson is more the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.150" end="00:08:50.890" style="s2">archetype of the academic of the classic</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.400" end="00:08:53.380" style="s2">liberal of the old British school with</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.890" end="00:08:56.620" style="s2">the moderate view something like that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.380" end="00:09:00.280" style="s2">I agree with you yeah yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.620" end="00:09:02.680" style="s2">Picasso was sort of you know he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.280" end="00:09:05.740" style="s2">celebrating life in this you know ran</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.680" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">this radical radical way Peterson seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.740" end="00:09:11.110" style="s2">to be talking about human suffering</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:15.130" style="s2">that&#39;s true that&#39;s true does he he seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.110" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">to be you know it&#39;s it&#39;s I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.130" end="00:09:17.740" style="s2">Dionysian and the apalla</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:21.070" style="s2">you know Apollonia you could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.740" end="00:09:25.390" style="s2">it and not and not sales yeah now I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.070" end="00:09:28.680" style="s2">thinking in the lines of what whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.390" end="00:09:32.260" style="s2">historical figures who rose to fame</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.680" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">equally fast and changed the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.260" end="00:09:37.750" style="s2">outset that immensely similar to to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:40.750" style="s2">Peterson and they were actually like two</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.750" end="00:09:44.180" style="s2">persons coming in mind to mind that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.750" end="00:09:47.240" style="s2">first was Sousa leery you know like an</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.180" end="00:09:51.770" style="s2">more from from the postmodern outset</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.240" end="00:09:55.670" style="s2">like equally an academic the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.770" end="00:09:58.120" style="s2">department exactly and and like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.670" end="00:10:01.400" style="s2">forerunners of a huge cultural movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.120" end="00:10:03.820" style="s2">and and the second one is strong brown</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.400" end="00:10:05.090" style="s2">in you know John Brown the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.820" end="00:10:07.730" style="s2">abolitionist</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.090" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know John Brown I know the name</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.730" end="00:10:13.180" style="s2">but I he was like a Puritan who lived</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:17.260" style="s2">fifty years of his life in obscurity</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.180" end="00:10:21.560" style="s2">until the the horrendous treatment of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.260" end="00:10:24.470" style="s2">escaped slave array led to his decision</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.560" end="00:10:28.610" style="s2">to fight the ruffians and the the South</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.470" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">southerners and with quite brutal way so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.610" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">and and his hanging where were Thoreau</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:37.430" style="s2">and Whitman and all those people like</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:40.070" style="s2">attended that was the the drop of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.430" end="00:10:44.120" style="s2">how do you say that the the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.070" end="00:10:47.060" style="s2">or the instigating moment for the civil</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.120" end="00:10:49.940" style="s2">war in the United States so that is so</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.060" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">he was like a crucial figure which rose</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.940" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">to fame and who stood up for the wrongs</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:59.750" style="s2">in a way and he instigated this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:02.060" style="s2">this this whole America which we know</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.750" end="00:11:05.060" style="s2">today and those were like the those two</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.060" end="00:11:08.570" style="s2">figures which somehow in in their</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.060" end="00:11:11.510" style="s2">cultural impact resemble a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.570" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">for me that he doesn&#39;t phenomenal I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.510" end="00:11:16.760" style="s2">thought of Marshall McLuhan but I guess</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:20.180" style="s2">Peterson is different in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.760" end="00:11:22.850" style="s2">he&#39;s Marshall McLuhan is more of an</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.180" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">abstract thinker or you know a theorist</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.850" end="00:11:28.550" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have this kind of almost you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:31.790" style="s2">know Peterson&#39;s almost a Holy Roller</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.550" end="00:11:33.800" style="s2">preacher you know in a way you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.790" end="00:11:36.080" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s out there changing people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.800" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">lives in a very direct Rek way I say</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.080" end="00:11:40.250" style="s2">Holy Roller preacher in the positive</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:43.550" style="s2">sense right you know it&#39;s like he&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.250" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">know he&#39;s even though he&#39;s working with</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.550" end="00:11:49.670" style="s2">science and evolution he&#39;s taken almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:51.950" style="s2">this evangelical quality to to into</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:54.640" style="s2">modernism or something like that right I</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.950" end="00:11:56.259" style="s2">don&#39;t want a particular focus on on</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.640" end="00:11:57.879" style="s2">Peterson yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.259" end="00:12:00.759" style="s2">because I mean you you have written</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.879" end="00:12:02.350" style="s2">extensively about that and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.759" end="00:12:05.109" style="s2">talk about the Intel intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.350" end="00:12:07.239" style="s2">web exactly because because as you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.109" end="00:12:09.910" style="s2">I think if we want to understand where</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.239" end="00:12:11.470" style="s2">we are at the moment and and even if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.910" end="00:12:13.389" style="s2">want to understand the Petersons</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.470" end="00:12:15.369" style="s2">phenomenon I think like a good focal</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.389" end="00:12:18.369" style="s2">point is this into an intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.369" end="00:12:22.119" style="s2">web because I think that&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.369" end="00:12:24.359" style="s2">important movement in a way a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.119" end="00:12:27.579" style="s2">development where a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.359" end="00:12:29.439" style="s2">participating not just active like</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.579" end="00:12:32.949" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole group of persons who</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.439" end="00:12:35.910" style="s2">engage in a form of new dialogue but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.949" end="00:12:38.379" style="s2">amount of cultural resonance they</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.910" end="00:12:40.809" style="s2">producing is quite astonishing so and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.379" end="00:12:43.179" style="s2">what what is your take on that on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.809" end="00:12:45.819" style="s2">intellectual dark web well in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.179" end="00:12:48.459" style="s2">beginning um I thought the name was kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.819" end="00:12:50.049" style="s2">of a misnomer like I didn&#39;t really I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.459" end="00:12:51.579" style="s2">didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t have too much</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.049" end="00:12:53.019" style="s2">appreciation for the group because I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.579" end="00:12:55.359" style="s2">thought they had too much of a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.019" end="00:12:56.949" style="s2">materialist bent like they were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.359" end="00:12:59.049" style="s2">a bunch of a few of them were new</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.949" end="00:13:00.939" style="s2">atheists and Enlightenment thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.049" end="00:13:04.089" style="s2">you know and I&#39;m more interested in I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.939" end="00:13:07.179" style="s2">guess the spiritual dimension and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.089" end="00:13:11.679" style="s2">deeper dimension so I I kind of I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.179" end="00:13:13.539" style="s2">I didn&#39;t see I saw their value as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.679" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">bunch of you know people talking and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.539" end="00:13:20.049" style="s2">having a conversation and I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:23.589" style="s2">was great but I warmed quite a bit to to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.049" end="00:13:28.449" style="s2">Eric and and his brother I think these</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.589" end="00:13:33.699" style="s2">guys are really sublime and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.449" end="00:13:36.819" style="s2">thinkers grappling steam biology so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.699" end="00:13:40.089" style="s2">know David fuller kind of pushed me in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.819" end="00:13:41.259" style="s2">their in their direction and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.089" end="00:13:43.749" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a guy named Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.259" end="00:13:45.669" style="s2">green Hall I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.749" end="00:13:48.009" style="s2">his stuff but he&#39;s a friend with the</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.629" end="00:13:57.669" style="s2">he&#39;s a very deep thinker and so so so in</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.359" end="00:13:59.529" style="s2">the sense what I think they represent is</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.669" end="00:14:03.939" style="s2">well I was trying to I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.529" end="00:14:06.100" style="s2">think about this let me just look at my</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.939" end="00:14:09.210" style="s2">you know I was trying to think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.100" end="00:14:14.100" style="s2">this is what they represent is</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.210" end="00:14:17.690" style="s2">and a middle middle ground for</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.780" end="00:17:58.049" style="s2">think they&#39;re all great and then I did</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.700" end="00:17:59.640" style="s2">write a piece called the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.049" end="00:18:02.789" style="s2">deep web because I thought there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.640" end="00:18:04.890" style="s2">this whole I thought that you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.789" end="00:18:07.140" style="s2">studied Buddhism and and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.890" end="00:18:09.659" style="s2">things like that and and so so I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.140" end="00:18:12.780" style="s2">interested in in meditation and I and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.659" end="00:18:18.090" style="s2">I thought this whole I thought that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.780" end="00:18:21.000" style="s2">bent their bent was more you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.090" end="00:18:22.860" style="s2">maybe maybe more political than then it</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.000" end="00:18:24.659" style="s2">could be even though they&#39;re they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.860" end="00:18:27.330" style="s2">sort of a political and that there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.659" end="00:18:35.070" style="s2">other figures perhaps deeper that could</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.330" end="00:18:37.020" style="s2">emerge as well so so yeah so there was</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.070" end="00:18:39.750" style="s2">um what was his name Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.020" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">Griner he had this idea called the inter</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.750" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">he was he was a guy from rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:45.570" style="s2">and the guys from mobile wearable wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.920" end="00:18:50.460" style="s2">invited me to their their men&#39;s group</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.570" end="00:18:52.380" style="s2">and right and he had this idea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.460" end="00:18:55.050" style="s2">there needs to be an intellectual deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.380" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">web right which would integrate you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.050" end="00:19:00.090" style="s2">all these other aspects which are or not</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:04.410" style="s2">or not not being talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.090" end="00:19:07.560" style="s2">intellectual dark club I think what what</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.410" end="00:19:10.260" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.560" end="00:19:12.060" style="s2">in regard that there is this dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.260" end="00:19:15.000" style="s2">which is a dialogue which is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.060" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">confined to the left or the right and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.000" end="00:19:19.620" style="s2">think that the towering figure of all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:21.810" style="s2">that is Jerome in a way because he is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.620" end="00:19:24.350" style="s2">able to deliver for the ride and for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.810" end="00:19:27.050" style="s2">left in a way and and has this long form</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.350" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">discussions like two or three hours and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.050" end="00:19:32.370" style="s2">provided the medium in a way where all</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:34.890" style="s2">this could flourish in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.370" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">you know either the Reuben report and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.890" end="00:19:39.150" style="s2">and all that all what they are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:42.210" style="s2">like they they all use this medium and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.150" end="00:19:47.340" style="s2">in a way I think it&#39;s a reaction against</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.210" end="00:19:48.930" style="s2">those in a way I think it&#39;s a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.340" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">against the conversations we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.930" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">day-to-day on Facebook because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">like fragmented and everybody has an</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:57.780" style="s2">opinion and nobody has a clue you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:00.120" style="s2">and everybody gets like easily offended</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.780" end="00:20:02.580" style="s2">you know on this point was for the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.120" end="00:20:04.430" style="s2">ten years like so like there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.580" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">more useless less than a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.430" end="00:20:07.290" style="s2">communication and conversation so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:09.720" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.290" end="00:20:11.700" style="s2">so because nobody has attacks just text</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.720" end="00:20:15.390" style="s2">people talking to each other in text</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.700" end="00:20:16.500" style="s2">right people that has been so toxic on</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.390" end="00:20:19.620" style="s2">the human soul</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.500" end="00:20:23.160" style="s2">right the human voice like I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.620" end="00:20:25.140" style="s2">too opens up the human voice right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.160" end="00:20:27.990" style="s2">people are actually having human you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.140" end="00:20:29.940" style="s2">know their conversations right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.990" end="00:20:34.020" style="s2">rather than attacking each other with</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.940" end="00:20:37.350" style="s2">these little fragments of text exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.020" end="00:20:39.570" style="s2">so I think that they&#39;re fed up you that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.350" end="00:20:41.910" style="s2">in a way and so then there&#39;s this medium</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.570" end="00:20:45.240" style="s2">Jerome with his millions of listeners</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.910" end="00:20:48.660" style="s2">per podcast I I&#39;ve heard some say he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.240" end="00:20:50.460" style="s2">the most famous interviewer of all time</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.660" end="00:20:52.620" style="s2">who has ever existed</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.460" end="00:20:54.840" style="s2">cause he has like so many listeners who</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.620" end="00:20:58.980" style="s2">tuned in for three hours to listen</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.840" end="00:21:00.780" style="s2">something about archaeology or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.980" end="00:21:04.470" style="s2">know what so and the weird thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.780" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">he&#39;s not he&#39;s not in the mainstream so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.470" end="00:21:08.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like a huge underground movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:11.670" style="s2">that&#39;s bigger than the mainstream to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.130" end="00:21:13.170" style="s2">like the mainstream has become the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.670" end="00:21:16.140" style="s2">mainstream has become the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.170" end="00:21:18.630" style="s2">irrelevant you know place to have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.140" end="00:21:20.730" style="s2">discussion no everything&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.630" end="00:21:24.600" style="s2">underground or everything&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.730" end="00:21:27.960" style="s2">off stage or everything everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.600" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">happening in this casual you know casual</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.960" end="00:21:32.670" style="s2">way in this YouTube you know diffusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:34.800" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s like the met the gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.670" end="00:21:37.740" style="s2">are gone right right</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.800" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">well well well they&#39;re still yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.740" end="00:21:43.950" style="s2">uh no because because I just wrote wrote</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.870" style="s2">a piece about I I haven&#39;t read it I had</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.950" end="00:21:49.110" style="s2">haven&#39;t had the time but about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.870" end="00:21:50.850" style="s2">Peterson Harris debate and if you see</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.110" end="00:21:53.400" style="s2">like the the videos which are leaked</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.850" end="00:21:56.100" style="s2">these are like thousands of people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.400" end="00:21:59.010" style="s2">just come to a two or three hour lecture</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.100" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">and consistently this is not like an</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.010" end="00:22:04.890" style="s2">isolated phenomenon but the people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:09.090" style="s2">like leaving YouTube in a way to attend</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.890" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">to those events which were you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.090" end="00:22:12.750" style="s2">like a theater or something you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:15.480" style="s2">what I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.750" end="00:22:19.470" style="s2">completely bonkers what what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.480" end="00:22:23.340" style="s2">happening yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s quite wild</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.470" end="00:22:25.470" style="s2">that such a normal simple you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.340" end="00:22:28.110" style="s2">almost conservative type of event just</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.470" end="00:22:30.450" style="s2">two people talking could could create</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.110" end="00:22:33.930" style="s2">that that kind of a crowd exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.450" end="00:22:38.550" style="s2">simplicity of it is is is it&#39;s almost a</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.860" end="00:22:52.980" style="s2">like especially if there are experts on</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.669" end="00:24:29.570" style="s2">oddly enough you know maybe even more</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.620" end="00:24:31.509" style="s2">compelling than Game of Thrones at times</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:51.529" style="s2">astounded because sometimes like late at</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.830" end="00:24:53.929" style="s2">night after work I I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.529" end="00:24:56.029" style="s2">see like a serial or something like some</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.929" end="00:24:59.149" style="s2">some of those things and then I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.029" end="00:25:01.940" style="s2">like the Joe Rogan is life with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.149" end="00:25:05.509" style="s2">and I think well I switch over to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.940" end="00:25:08.570" style="s2">and then I&#39;m like to two hours are gone</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.509" end="00:25:10.279" style="s2">you know that&#39;s right what happened what</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.570" end="00:25:13.519" style="s2">about amazed I&#39;ve also noticed that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.279" end="00:25:16.399" style="s2">it&#39;s caused me to learn faster in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.519" end="00:25:17.309" style="s2">different way than just reading you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.399" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">because you</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.309" end="00:25:23.220" style="s2">you can you can get a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:25.259" style="s2">by listening and you know Peterson makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.220" end="00:25:27.179" style="s2">this point is that people just listen to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.259" end="00:25:30.419" style="s2">these things and and that the list</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.179" end="00:25:33.570" style="s2">almost like the aural mode of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.419" end="00:25:35.759" style="s2">communication is is is as has gone past</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.570" end="00:25:38.190" style="s2">the the written mode of communication in</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.759" end="00:25:40.019" style="s2">terms of how people get educated so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.190" end="00:25:41.820" style="s2">know so you can listen to the Peterson&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.950" end="00:25:52.110" style="s2">in but you can learn about it and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.980" end="00:25:54.389" style="s2">can apply it you know to the people you</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.610" end="00:26:02.610" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s like I I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.029" end="00:26:04.289" style="s2">study psychology in a formal way but now</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.610" end="00:26:07.259" style="s2">I feel you know like I know something</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.289" end="00:26:09.389" style="s2">about it and just and that&#39;s just from</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.259" end="00:26:12.179" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I was washing the dishes</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.389" end="00:26:16.769" style="s2">not while I took a period of time out of</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.749" end="00:26:25.249" style="s2">a bit lower and conscientiousness and my</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.490" end="00:26:27.749" style="s2">wife is very high in conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.249" end="00:26:29.369" style="s2">you know so we have a good team a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.749" end="00:26:31.110" style="s2">balance and but she&#39;s a bit low and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.369" end="00:26:34.649" style="s2">openness so that&#39;s why she has these</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.110" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">views about you know III really learned</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.649" end="00:26:39.029" style="s2">a lot from seeing you know from</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.840" end="00:26:41.220" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s personality courses and see</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.029" end="00:26:44.190" style="s2">how people are very different and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.220" end="00:26:47.190" style="s2">think that&#39;s the spirit of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.190" end="00:26:48.629" style="s2">deep web is that is it a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.190" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">who are have highly different</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">and having mature conversations right I</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.340" end="00:27:01.649" style="s2">think that&#39;s exactly right as a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:05.159" style="s2">to this sort of you know cultish you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.649" end="00:27:08.970" style="s2">know facebook world that people have</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.159" end="00:27:13.220" style="s2">been sort of living in in the past ten</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.970" end="00:27:16.529" style="s2">years there&#39;s a thesis and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.220" end="00:27:20.279" style="s2">like an idea I have which I would like</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.529" end="00:27:21.869" style="s2">to formulate and think what and hear</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.279" end="00:27:25.139" style="s2">what you think about it because I was I</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.869" end="00:27:27.119" style="s2">was thinking okay you certainly know</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.139" end="00:27:29.789" style="s2">spiral dynamics and the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.119" end="00:27:30.809" style="s2">culturally the culture is developing</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.789" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">over over stay</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.809" end="00:27:35.309" style="s2">just in a way so we are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:37.080" style="s2">living in a postmodern era and before</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.309" end="00:27:39.240" style="s2">that industrialization enlightenment was</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.080" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">the more modern thing before the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.240" end="00:27:47.249" style="s2">pre-modern and what I noticed that every</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:49.409" style="s2">era when when it&#39;s beginning when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.249" end="00:27:51.809" style="s2">starting out it has a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.409" end="00:27:53.850" style="s2">coming together and you can find that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.809" end="00:27:56.490" style="s2">when you when you look at post modernity</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.850" end="00:27:58.590" style="s2">for example you have like the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.490" end="00:28:01.590" style="s2">Parisian movement with yeah you have to</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:21.480" style="s2">like post modernity you have this group</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.139" end="00:28:24.090" style="s2">of artists and they know each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.480" end="00:28:27.299" style="s2">way in their build they they they create</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.090" end="00:28:32.129" style="s2">a tribe so to speak yeah if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.299" end="00:28:34.499" style="s2">go 300 years back into the past with</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.129" end="00:28:36.960" style="s2">modernity you find something very</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.499" end="00:28:39.690" style="s2">similar with with Newton with lightness</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.960" end="00:28:42.899" style="s2">and and like where where theories are</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.690" end="00:28:45.179" style="s2">created what was it Malthus and Devine</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.899" end="00:28:47.970" style="s2">for example they had similar ideas they</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.179" end="00:28:49.980" style="s2">were in contact in some sort like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.970" end="00:28:53.220" style="s2">media was not that developed so they had</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.980" end="00:28:56.249" style="s2">to communicate with letters so and I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.220" end="00:29:01.019" style="s2">I was thinking okay we are approaching</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.249" end="00:29:05.909" style="s2">maybe a post-postmodern time mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.019" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">you know wouldn&#39;t it be to be expected</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.909" end="00:29:10.830" style="s2">that there is a group of people coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:13.429" style="s2">together who embody that kind of stage</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.830" end="00:29:16.259" style="s2">of development for the first time and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.429" end="00:29:20.940" style="s2">producing the outlet and the blueprint</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.259" end="00:29:23.460" style="s2">of what trickles down in into society</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.940" end="00:29:25.230" style="s2">and the years to follow and I was and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.460" end="00:29:27.629" style="s2">was looking for that for the last five</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.230" end="00:29:29.759" style="s2">or ten years and I was thinking if the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.629" end="00:29:32.070" style="s2">and thinking about the integral movement</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.759" end="00:29:33.529" style="s2">but there wasn&#39;t yet have been happening</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.070" end="00:29:36.090" style="s2">nothing of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.529" end="00:29:38.250" style="s2">yeah well it seemed that they that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.090" end="00:29:40.230" style="s2">integral movement kind of they</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.250" end="00:29:41.820" style="s2">they felt like there was something</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.230" end="00:29:43.860" style="s2">happening in the integral movement in</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.820" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">the beginning that seemed very alive and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.860" end="00:29:49.080" style="s2">then they kind of retreated or something</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">exactly the stage and and so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.080" end="00:29:53.130" style="s2">was very excited about the integral</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:54.920" style="s2">movement in the beginning but now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.130" end="00:29:57.660" style="s2">wondering where they are you know like</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.920" end="00:29:58.800" style="s2">why aren&#39;t they out there engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.660" end="00:30:01.290" style="s2">you know all these people</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.800" end="00:30:03.450" style="s2">exactly right some of their ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.290" end="00:30:06.180" style="s2">probably more advanced in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.450" end="00:30:08.340" style="s2">intellectual darkweb but but but but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.180" end="00:30:10.980" style="s2">guess they&#39;re not hating the culture in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.340" end="00:30:13.320" style="s2">the guts you know in the same way what</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.980" end="00:30:16.350" style="s2">intellectual darkweb is doing is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.320" end="00:30:19.320" style="s2">they&#39;re people with their own platforms</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.350" end="00:30:21.330" style="s2">coming together and testing their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.320" end="00:30:23.730" style="s2">and bringing them out into the world for</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.330" end="00:30:25.680" style="s2">example by using YouTube and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.730" end="00:30:28.050" style="s2">they&#39;re engaging with the world so and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.680" end="00:30:32.070" style="s2">my thesis is and I want to know what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.050" end="00:30:34.980" style="s2">think about that if we could think of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.070" end="00:30:37.770" style="s2">the intellectual darkweb as an as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.980" end="00:30:39.690" style="s2">tribal group emerging from</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.770" end="00:30:41.280" style="s2">post-postmodern consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.690" end="00:30:43.620" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s how I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.280" end="00:30:45.810" style="s2">thinking about it as well I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.620" end="00:30:49.590" style="s2">thinking that the perfect human</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.810" end="00:30:51.870" style="s2">community or the the archetypal human</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.590" end="00:30:53.430" style="s2">community is the tribe and the tribe is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.870" end="00:30:56.040" style="s2">the place where people are most alive</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.430" end="00:30:59.280" style="s2">and most engaged and with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.040" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like the The Economist shoe</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:03.690" style="s2">maker said small is beautiful when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:07.380" style="s2">have that small group of people it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.690" end="00:31:10.710" style="s2">the maximum effect uh-huh and if each</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.380" end="00:31:12.260" style="s2">person has a different each person plays</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.710" end="00:31:14.700" style="s2">a different role right they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.260" end="00:31:16.920" style="s2">ideologically driven they&#39;re driven just</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.700" end="00:31:19.140" style="s2">by their own particular individuality</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.920" end="00:31:20.370" style="s2">and passion right and but if they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.140" end="00:31:23.310" style="s2">different then that&#39;s that has the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.370" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">maximum effect and yeah I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.310" end="00:31:28.260" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s you know our</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:29.940" style="s2">thinking about this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.260" end="00:31:31.320" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s anti tribalism but I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.940" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">there has to be a kind of enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.320" end="00:31:35.160" style="s2">tribalism right there has to be like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.940" end="00:31:37.740" style="s2">because that&#39;s that that to me is is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.160" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">way to live right it&#39;s small groups of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.740" end="00:31:42.510" style="s2">people expressing the maximum</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:44.520" style="s2">individuality or somehow human beings</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.510" end="00:31:47.130" style="s2">are meant for that you can see that in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.520" end="00:31:50.070" style="s2">football game or you know you could see</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.130" end="00:31:50.920" style="s2">that in a rock concert or anything if</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.070" end="00:31:53.560" style="s2">you have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.920" end="00:31:54.520" style="s2">ten people are five people there there</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.560" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">them there</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.520" end="00:32:03.630" style="s2">they&#39;re the most powerful and engaging</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:06.820" style="s2">you know mode I think of people for for</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.630" end="00:32:09.190" style="s2">you know for pushing pushing the culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.820" end="00:32:13.210" style="s2">forward certainly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.190" end="00:32:15.160" style="s2">so I so I agree with that I and III I</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.210" end="00:32:18.040" style="s2">agree with I think these guys are on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.160" end="00:32:22.360" style="s2">front lines and maybe maybe the maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.040" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">the integral movement became too</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.360" end="00:32:26.950" style="s2">conceptual and in some in some in some</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:29.410" style="s2">kind of way and putting people in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.950" end="00:32:31.630" style="s2">categories and then deciding that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.410" end="00:32:34.540" style="s2">somebody is green and somebody is red</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.630" end="00:32:36.010" style="s2">and some you know you get there were two</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.540" end="00:32:37.930" style="s2">categorical and they weren&#39;t maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.010" end="00:32:39.820" style="s2">passionate enough and engaged enough and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.930" end="00:32:44.050" style="s2">you know take going out there and taking</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.820" end="00:32:46.510" style="s2">risks somehow that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it seems</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.050" end="00:32:50.140" style="s2">to be a performative contradiction of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.510" end="00:32:52.600" style="s2">integral that they claim to be open and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.140" end="00:32:54.840" style="s2">to integrate everything but what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.600" end="00:32:58.030" style="s2">don&#39;t do is integrate other</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:33:00.340" style="s2">post-postmodern philosophies and have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.030" end="00:33:03.280" style="s2">actual dialogue with that I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.340" end="00:33:06.060" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s meta modernism in its</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.280" end="00:33:08.620" style="s2">different forms which claims to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.060" end="00:33:10.360" style="s2">coming after post-modernism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.620" end="00:33:13.000" style="s2">diggy modernism there&#39;s performance</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.360" end="00:33:15.270" style="s2">isn&#39;t in all those different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.000" end="00:33:17.800" style="s2">concept of a world view after</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.270" end="00:33:20.290" style="s2">post-modernism but they don&#39;t engage</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.800" end="00:33:23.530" style="s2">with that and and they&#39;s they stay</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.290" end="00:33:25.750" style="s2">within their within their within their</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.530" end="00:33:27.310" style="s2">bubble in a way really hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.750" end="00:33:29.530" style="s2">will change you know so maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.310" end="00:33:30.790" style="s2">too centered around this one person can</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.530" end="00:33:32.950" style="s2">will over maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.790" end="00:33:35.170" style="s2">problem I don&#39;t know maybe but he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.950" end="00:33:38.260" style="s2">Ken&#39;s great I don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.170" end="00:33:40.210" style="s2">to put him down in any way but but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.260" end="00:33:42.040" style="s2">they have to branch out and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.210" end="00:33:44.500" style="s2">maybe maybe there has to be different</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.040" end="00:33:46.930" style="s2">personalities that are expressing you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.500" end="00:33:50.350" style="s2">know the kind of strong views that he is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.930" end="00:33:53.410" style="s2">no I completely agree but just just in</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.350" end="00:33:56.100" style="s2">exploring the phenomenon of the idea we</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.410" end="00:33:58.570" style="s2">I think I mean you can&#39;t find more</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.100" end="00:34:03.220" style="s2">different people than Jordan Peters and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.570" end="00:34:05.710" style="s2">Joe Rogan and ben shapiro yeah so there</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.220" end="00:34:07.570" style="s2">in every kind of way well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.710" end="00:34:09.220" style="s2">beautiful and also you know even me I</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.570" end="00:34:11.080" style="s2">just wrote an article about Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.220" end="00:34:13.390" style="s2">and I was attacking Sam Harris in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.080" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">sense because I disagree with Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.390" end="00:34:18.040" style="s2">but I learned something from Peterson in</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:20.710" style="s2">the he went out and he&#39;s having these</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.040" end="00:34:23.140" style="s2">talks with Sam Harris and on a friendly</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.710" end="00:34:24.760" style="s2">terms and and that&#39;s that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.140" end="00:34:26.950" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful that&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.760" end="00:34:29.470" style="s2">should be done rather than you know then</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.950" end="00:34:31.270" style="s2">me just sitting and writing nasty things</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.470" end="00:34:35.700" style="s2">about Sam Harris because I disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.270" end="00:34:40.780" style="s2">them you know congenial long nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.700" end="00:34:44.260" style="s2">conversations that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.780" end="00:34:47.680" style="s2">with without any any restriction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.260" end="00:34:49.410" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of great no it doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.680" end="00:34:51.910" style="s2">know where if you talk only to those who</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.410" end="00:34:55.000" style="s2">share the same worldview so you need</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.910" end="00:34:57.490" style="s2">somebody else who comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.000" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">opposite opposite end of the spectrum to</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.490" end="00:35:01.390" style="s2">challenge your ideas and to develop</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:02.620" style="s2">those ideas and I think that is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.390" end="00:35:03.990" style="s2">they are doing in a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.620" end="00:35:05.800" style="s2">what do you mean but can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.990" end="00:35:09.850" style="s2">elaborate what you mean by post</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.800" end="00:35:12.190" style="s2">post-modernism for me well what what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.850" end="00:35:14.050" style="s2">mean by that is and how&#39;s that different</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.190" end="00:35:15.400" style="s2">from integral or what they would call it</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.050" end="00:35:17.770" style="s2">they would call that integral wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.400" end="00:35:18.580" style="s2">they they would call that integral yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.770" end="00:35:22.740" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.580" end="00:35:26.260" style="s2">so from for me post post-modernism is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.740" end="00:35:30.310" style="s2">cultural stage which is the soil from</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.260" end="00:35:32.710" style="s2">which all those those philosophies made</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.310" end="00:35:35.140" style="s2">the integral or performance is imodium</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.710" end="00:35:38.020" style="s2">modernism springing forth in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.140" end="00:35:41.020" style="s2">is a stage of cognitive or social</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.020" end="00:35:44.860" style="s2">development which integrates in a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:48.790" style="s2">the virtues of all stages below but are</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.860" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">able to transcend the fallacies so and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.790" end="00:35:53.770" style="s2">and I find it very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:55.840" style="s2">compare those different philosophies and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.770" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">theories to see ok what what is their</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.840" end="00:36:00.330" style="s2">common element for example from integral</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.150" end="00:36:02.350" style="s2">theory and media modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.330" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">performance isn&#39;t because when you look</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.350" end="00:36:06.730" style="s2">at at the at the Dutch school of made</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:08.430" style="s2">our modern ISM not that handsy Frye</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.730" end="00:36:10.870" style="s2">enough thing but the stuff from</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.109" end="00:38:59.949" style="s2">kind of dangerous and alive and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:15.930" end="00:43:20.490" style="s2">thing so that seems to be immensely</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:24.329" style="s2">immensely positive but you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.490" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">dangerous dangerous times indeed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.329" end="00:43:28.650" style="s2">that&#39;s a great podcast school Scott a</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">school sucks project do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.650" end="00:43:35.880" style="s2">one no no it&#39;s like I think it should</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:39.470" style="s2">belong to the to the to the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.880" end="00:43:42.630" style="s2">dark web because there are people there</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.470" end="00:43:44.940" style="s2">xxx Russell you know him I&#39;ve heard his</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.630" end="00:43:47.849" style="s2">name I heard that I think I I had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.940" end="00:43:50.300" style="s2">podcast with him one of my early podcast</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.849" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">and I think he might be one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.300" end="00:43:56.910" style="s2">most intelligent people I know quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:44:00.030" style="s2">frankly and and he actually tried to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.910" end="00:44:02.849" style="s2">have some discussions with Peterson but</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.030" end="00:44:05.250" style="s2">there never happened they never take</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.849" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">place I don&#39;t know why because he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.250" end="00:44:10.170" style="s2">historian and he is quite critical of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:13.700" style="s2">the school system but he is a staunch</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.170" end="00:44:17.990" style="s2">defender of post-modernism and but but</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.700" end="00:44:20.790" style="s2">he sees the the fallacies of</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.990" end="00:44:22.829" style="s2">post-modernism but he has a completely</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.790" end="00:44:25.589" style="s2">different take on the whole phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.829" end="00:44:27.180" style="s2">yeah and I think what I find Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.589" end="00:44:28.440" style="s2">critique of post-modernism a bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.180" end="00:44:32.940" style="s2">reductive right</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.440" end="00:44:35.400" style="s2">IIIi think that the postmodern period</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.940" end="00:44:37.890" style="s2">might be a necessary stage the girls</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.400" end="00:44:39.240" style="s2">daughters and but also to transcend it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.890" end="00:44:40.500" style="s2">like this you know the Zen phrase</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.240" end="00:44:42.329" style="s2">there&#39;s mountains and rivers then</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.500" end="00:44:43.859" style="s2">there&#39;s no mountains and rivers and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.329" end="00:44:46.230" style="s2">there&#39;s mountains and rivers again so</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.859" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">the postmodern thing is like you take</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.230" end="00:44:50.130" style="s2">away all the mountains and rivers right</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">and right but then you have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.130" end="00:44:56.130" style="s2">you have to go back to some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:58.380" style="s2">reality so III yeah I mean I three thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.130" end="00:44:59.910" style="s2">as I was reading I finally got around to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.380" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">reading Foucault when I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.910" end="00:45:06.930" style="s2">Peters it was interesting that I was I</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:08.849" style="s2">was reading Slavic Z Zak and Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.930" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">and all these people when I came upon</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.849" end="00:45:14.460" style="s2">Peterson and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:16.650" style="s2">maybe the postmodern stages maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.460" end="00:45:18.630" style="s2">maybe Peterson&#39;s discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.650" end="00:45:21.810" style="s2">post-modernism is a bit reductive right</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.630" end="00:45:23.820" style="s2">and I think that this is Russell he he</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.810" end="00:45:26.040" style="s2">seriously could challenge is used</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.820" end="00:45:28.260" style="s2">because what what what stuck with me is</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.040" end="00:45:29.970" style="s2">one one expression he he had was girag</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.260" end="00:45:33.950" style="s2">one thing he said and he said for him</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.970" end="00:45:37.250" style="s2">the postmodern stage and the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.950" end="00:45:41.070" style="s2">advancement are the most supreme</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.250" end="00:45:44.250" style="s2">inventions humankind has ever had namely</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.070" end="00:45:46.950" style="s2">the idea that in a way everything is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.250" end="00:45:49.260" style="s2">social construct you know and you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.950" end="00:45:51.900" style="s2">have that perspective because you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.260" end="00:45:54.510" style="s2">there are no given hierarchies you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.900" end="00:45:57.210" style="s2">there are no given hierarchies between</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.510" end="00:46:01.349" style="s2">races or between people you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.210" end="00:46:04.230" style="s2">the first time in history humankind has</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.349" end="00:46:06.750" style="s2">deconstructed these basic notions that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.230" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">there are differences between men you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.750" end="00:46:11.730" style="s2">know between white and black and poor</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:14.550" style="s2">and rich or men a female and he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.730" end="00:46:17.220" style="s2">the most supreme invention of of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.550" end="00:46:21.450" style="s2">humankind and and you have to give it to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.220" end="00:46:23.880" style="s2">him you know it&#39;s right so but I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.450" end="00:46:26.760" style="s2">Peterson is not looking out for those</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.880" end="00:46:28.650" style="s2">virtues of post modernity you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.760" end="00:46:30.210" style="s2">you know well he&#39;s correct about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.650" end="00:46:33.569" style="s2">pathologies of postmodern right</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.210" end="00:46:34.859" style="s2">certainly yeah but as I say I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.569" end="00:46:37.460" style="s2">about perhaps he&#39;s throwing the baby out</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.859" end="00:46:39.710" style="s2">with the bathwater a little right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.460" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">so that would be interesting if they</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.710" end="00:46:44.609" style="s2">would have like a discussion that would</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:48.780" style="s2">prove that that the way of communication</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.609" end="00:46:50.250" style="s2">is working they they they have but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.780" end="00:46:55.140" style="s2">hasn&#39;t happened yet but I but I&#39;m eager</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.250" end="00:47:00.089" style="s2">to to see that it seems to be a new mode</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.140" end="00:47:01.710" style="s2">of learning and in a sense that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.089" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">coming coming out and and but through</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.710" end="00:47:05.730" style="s2">through conversation it&#39;s new and at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:11.460" style="s2">same time it&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.730" end="00:47:13.859" style="s2">ancient true those it uses the most</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.460" end="00:47:15.900" style="s2">primordial way of communication so</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.859" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the interesting thing where we</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.900" end="00:47:21.060" style="s2">are people who need to talk and to need</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:23.069" style="s2">to hear and have to do that in a in an</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.060" end="00:47:25.050" style="s2">honest and authentic Wayne and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.069" end="00:47:27.840" style="s2">that that mode of come</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.050" end="00:47:29.640" style="s2">education is delivering that what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.840" end="00:47:31.700" style="s2">would hope that will come next would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.640" end="00:47:33.840" style="s2">another artistic movement you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.700" end="00:47:35.460" style="s2">because that&#39;s probably missing from</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.840" end="00:47:38.100" style="s2">because they&#39;re an intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.460" end="00:47:40.830" style="s2">webmin right and then the intellect has</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.100" end="00:47:43.350" style="s2">to has to also you know all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.830" end="00:47:46.170" style="s2">other forms of expression you know how</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.350" end="00:47:52.530" style="s2">are important as well you know dance and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.170" end="00:47:54.030" style="s2">music right and so so I mean never you</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.530" end="00:47:56.130" style="s2">know you can&#39;t imagine these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.030" end="00:47:59.340" style="s2">things but but do you know do you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.130" end="00:48:02.100" style="s2">role as women you know no he is he is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.340" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">the originator he&#39;s a German professor</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.100" end="00:48:09.030" style="s2">of perform at ISM and he has a book</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">dedicated to the different forms of art</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.030" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">and architecture and music after</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:15.750" style="s2">post-modernism and it is quite</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:21.060" style="s2">interesting so it&#39;s like it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.750" end="00:48:24.360" style="s2">integral theory but like not not in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.060" end="00:48:25.590" style="s2">way model-driven but looking out into</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.360" end="00:48:27.090" style="s2">the world and seeing okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.590" end="00:48:28.680" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.090" end="00:48:31.140" style="s2">architecture there&#39;s clearly some kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.680" end="00:48:33.090" style="s2">of art literature which which</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.140" end="00:48:36.090" style="s2">distinguishes themselves against</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.090" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">post-modernism and he tries to model</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.090" end="00:48:41.700" style="s2">that why how is it different and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">quite interesting yeah it&#39;s so it may be</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.700" end="00:48:45.870" style="s2">hard to define at this point like when</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:48.210" style="s2">you&#39;re in the middle of it right so a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.870" end="00:48:51.450" style="s2">good example would be Life of Pi do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.210" end="00:48:53.670" style="s2">know that book never read it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.450" end="00:48:55.320" style="s2">about you know if you have postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.670" end="00:48:56.730" style="s2">literature it&#39;s all about stream of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.320" end="00:48:59.850" style="s2">consciousness and everything is</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.730" end="00:49:02.490" style="s2">subjective and you never know like if</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.850" end="00:49:05.940" style="s2">you if you read James Joyce for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.490" end="00:49:09.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like all in any way convoluted and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.940" end="00:49:12.510" style="s2">you have to you know yeah right so but</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.000" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">but James Joyce&#39;s is but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.510" end="00:49:16.170" style="s2">strictly postmodern he&#39;s more of his</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:17.670" style="s2">high modernism is usually considered to</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.170" end="00:49:19.560" style="s2">be high modernism because he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.670" end="00:49:22.710" style="s2">working within a narrative frame I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.560" end="00:49:24.990" style="s2">you know right he&#39;s still he&#39;s just he</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.710" end="00:49:27.060" style="s2">has his musicality of words but but</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.990" end="00:49:29.100" style="s2">there&#39;s still a story you know right oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.060" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">take Samuel Beckett for example that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.100" end="00:49:32.430" style="s2">racket back it is like the end of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:33.530" style="s2">modernism and then moving into</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.430" end="00:49:36.770" style="s2">post-modernism where</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.530" end="00:49:38.420" style="s2">could be anything but right the problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.770" end="00:49:40.550" style="s2">with post modernity is that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.420" end="00:49:42.710" style="s2">real contents about what it is when when</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.550" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">it started and what you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.710" end="00:49:49.930" style="s2">from from an historical point of view</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:52.790" style="s2">you could attribute for example joys as</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.930" end="00:49:55.250" style="s2">being postmodern although I think from</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.790" end="00:49:56.990" style="s2">literary theory he&#39;s modern you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.250" end="00:49:58.340" style="s2">it&#39;s littered high modern is my site a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.990" end="00:50:00.020" style="s2">bit illiterate serves Beckett they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.340" end="00:50:02.750" style="s2">considered high modernism like the end</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.020" end="00:50:05.300" style="s2">of modernism come right ultimate extent</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.330" end="00:53:22.090" style="s2">because the group was a bunch of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.550" end="00:53:24.310" style="s2">hipsters and London cool people and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.090" end="00:53:27.910" style="s2">really into all kinds of interesting</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.910" end="00:53:31.720" style="s2">was sort of thinking okay they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be a Peter Sohn type so</p>

<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:37.450" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be but it doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.950" end="00:53:40.660" style="s2">be the case it seems to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.450" end="00:53:42.670" style="s2">intelligent people are you know into</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.660" end="00:53:44.860" style="s2">this stuff right and people who are</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.970" end="00:54:14.130" style="s2">stuff and it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting how how</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:15.840" style="s2">how deep that goes like some people are</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.130" end="00:54:17.849" style="s2">into Peterson and they want to just get</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.840" end="00:54:20.280" style="s2">their lives together and then stop</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.849" end="00:54:22.020" style="s2">smoking pot and watching so much porn</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.280" end="00:54:25.109" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s other people are</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.020" end="00:54:26.730" style="s2">very into the much deeper existential</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.109" end="00:54:30.210" style="s2">questions and then there&#39;s other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.730" end="00:54:34.349" style="s2">are into the esoteric union are</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.210" end="00:54:38.280" style="s2">architecting types and and all that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.349" end="00:54:42.030" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s quite a diverse</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.280" end="00:54:44.369" style="s2">spectrum that you know right that arises</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.030" end="00:54:46.710" style="s2">from this this whole intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.369" end="00:54:51.900" style="s2">darkweb community and what&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.710" end="00:54:54.210" style="s2">it and one of the things I was - I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.900" end="00:54:57.530" style="s2">talking talking about David fuller a</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.210" end="00:55:02.910" style="s2">David fuller has these men&#39;s groups and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.530" end="00:55:07.770" style="s2">the idea that the idea that you know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.910" end="00:55:10.950" style="s2">I I the fact that men&#39;s groups kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.770" end="00:55:13.349" style="s2">bothered me in the beginning in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.950" end="00:55:18.060" style="s2">I thought you know just it just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.349" end="00:55:20.839" style="s2">something that interests me but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.060" end="00:55:23.700" style="s2">whole the whole the whole sexual</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.839" end="00:55:25.560" style="s2">political aspect of all this and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.700" end="00:55:28.470" style="s2">fact that the Petersons is is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.560" end="00:55:34.550" style="s2">and and the intellectual darkweb they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.470" end="00:55:36.960" style="s2">they&#39;ve been kind of um demonized</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.550" end="00:55:37.500" style="s2">because they are they are they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:39.240" style="s2">they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.500" end="00:55:40.830" style="s2">you know or the Petersons has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.240" end="00:55:42.300" style="s2">demonized because he&#39;s he because</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.830" end="00:55:44.940" style="s2">because he&#39;s coming on with a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.300" end="00:55:47.000" style="s2">strong and masculine message and so and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.940" end="00:55:50.099" style="s2">then you know is all his all images is</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.000" end="00:55:52.800" style="s2">you know his whole thing is ISM is of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.099" end="00:55:54.900" style="s2">the the hero the the masculine myth</p>

<p begin="00:55:54.900" end="00:55:58.859" style="s2">again and I think this is a positive</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.390" end="00:56:02.790" style="s2">thing and I also think that this will</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.859" end="00:56:05.310" style="s2">strengthen that the feminine archetype</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.790" end="00:56:08.609" style="s2">types as well and and and rescue them</p>

<p begin="00:58:36.010" end="00:58:40.270" style="s2">think a lot of criticism comes from that</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.900" end="00:58:43.420" style="s2">that they all have like a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.270" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">worldview regarding sex and marriage and</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:51.160" style="s2">can argue for that because they they are</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.150" end="00:58:54.310" style="s2">biologists and they can see where where</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.160" end="00:58:56.920" style="s2">the roots are coming from yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.310" end="00:59:01.930" style="s2">also just these vicious attacks that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.920" end="00:59:04.230" style="s2">get well you know on Facebook or or</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.930" end="00:59:07.720" style="s2">whatever from people because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.230" end="00:59:10.060" style="s2">defending Peterson it it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.720" end="00:59:13.240" style="s2">and he&#39;s considered to be this patriarch</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.060" end="00:59:17.590" style="s2">in and there&#39;s this sort of hidden</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.240" end="00:59:21.160" style="s2">hatred of men that that that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.590" end="00:59:23.530" style="s2">have you know poison poison poison the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.160" end="00:59:27.250" style="s2">culture and you know this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.530" end="00:59:29.050" style="s2">nobleman becoming an important thing you</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.250" end="00:59:32.140" style="s2">know important thing in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.050" end="00:59:34.359" style="s2">again right Gordon you know just as</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.140" end="00:59:39.430" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously has to be an image of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.359" end="00:59:41.500" style="s2">the noble woman so no but but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.430" end="00:59:43.630" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s take some minutes and dive</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.500" end="00:59:45.160" style="s2">into that because I think that is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.630" end="00:59:47.770" style="s2">we were stuck starting this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.160" end="00:59:51.430" style="s2">about asking why the polarity</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.770" end="00:59:53.530" style="s2">why why does Peterson and his friends so</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.430" end="00:59:56.580" style="s2">to speak like invoke such deep</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.530" end="01:00:00.310" style="s2">admiration as well as deep like</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.580" end="01:00:03.580" style="s2">adversity you know what why is that I</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.310" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">mean because I think the culture just</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.580" end="01:00:09.339" style="s2">encourages consensus you know and if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:15.690" style="s2">come out and say something in a fierce</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.339" end="01:00:19.420" style="s2">strong masculine way people are or</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.690" end="01:00:22.089" style="s2">become afraid or something right it may</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.420" end="01:00:25.510" style="s2">be that with violence or or or something</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.089" end="01:00:27.099" style="s2">like that right especially from the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.510" end="01:00:29.470" style="s2">postmodern types who are more feminine</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.099" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">and more sensitive and they&#39;re all about</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.470" end="01:00:36.280" style="s2">like what is like violence violence less</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:37.240" style="s2">communication and stuff like that but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.280" end="01:00:39.190" style="s2">mean in order and</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.240" end="01:00:44.290" style="s2">he says so in order to have a discussion</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.190" end="01:00:46.420" style="s2">you have to you know pursue and your ID</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.290" end="01:00:48.790" style="s2">ideas and to challenge your ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.420" end="01:00:51.880" style="s2">is always a little bit aggressive in</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.790" end="01:00:56.770" style="s2">sense that you have to approach the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.880" end="01:01:01.810" style="s2">topic you know yeah and and the the soft</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.770" end="01:01:07.090" style="s2">sensitive guy you know who imitates the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.810" end="01:01:09.460" style="s2">feminine you know he&#39;s he&#39;s a he&#39;s he is</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.090" end="01:01:13.720" style="s2">at a disadvantage you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.460" end="01:01:15.840" style="s2">culture and and you know not that not</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.720" end="01:01:19.300" style="s2">that you wouldn&#39;t want to become the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.840" end="01:01:23.110" style="s2">alpha male type or the you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.300" end="01:01:26.320" style="s2">aggressive you know but but at the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.110" end="01:01:28.510" style="s2">time it seems I don&#39;t know just from my</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.320" end="01:01:31.360" style="s2">own personal experience is that I had</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.510" end="01:01:33.190" style="s2">you know a lesbian mother and and I grew</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.360" end="01:01:35.350" style="s2">up very progressive and I had very long</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.190" end="01:01:37.690" style="s2">hair and it almost like fell in love</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.350" end="01:01:39.369" style="s2">with women by imitating them right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.690" end="01:01:41.050" style="s2">so it wasn&#39;t important for me</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.369" end="01:01:43.330" style="s2">masculinity wasn&#39;t important for me</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.050" end="01:01:47.140" style="s2">until later you know that that I had to</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.330" end="01:01:49.180" style="s2">break out of that and and so pull air so</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.140" end="01:01:51.850" style="s2">I had to reestablish kind of polarities</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.180" end="01:01:53.740" style="s2">I had the actual idea of being male</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.850" end="01:01:57.400" style="s2">became important to me again worse right</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.740" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">postmodern sort of fog you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.400" end="01:02:02.260" style="s2">don&#39;t want to identify with male or</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:04.720" style="s2">female or any kind of kind of polarity</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.260" end="01:02:06.100" style="s2">but later later it became very important</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.720" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">to me and I realized that we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.100" end="01:02:13.119" style="s2">living in this fatherless kind of world</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:15.040" style="s2">in in postmodern society and again this</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.119" end="01:02:16.630" style="s2">comes back I started to talk about Trump</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.040" end="01:02:19.119" style="s2">because Trump is the image of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.630" end="01:02:23.050" style="s2">pathological man in a way or this you</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.119" end="01:02:25.510" style="s2">know grabbing you know unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.050" end="01:02:28.600" style="s2">sort of lying type of you know he just</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.510" end="01:02:31.540" style="s2">did and and that that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.600" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">becomes the male figure when the actual</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.540" end="01:02:37.750" style="s2">dignified male person is is put down to</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:40.210" style="s2">the extent that true doesn&#39;t even a kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.750" end="01:02:41.830" style="s2">of kind of exists so so I always thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.210" end="01:02:46.900" style="s2">that the the election of Trump was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.830" end="01:02:49.570" style="s2">the reason or the election of Trump</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.900" end="01:02:52.750" style="s2">Trump was as much a</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.570" end="01:02:56.050" style="s2">a reason if this extreme progressivism</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.750" end="01:02:59.020" style="s2">as as it was with the the the the rise</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.050" end="01:03:01.180" style="s2">of the the right like good the extreme</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.020" end="01:03:04.510" style="s2">progressives and and the right are in</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.180" end="01:03:08.920" style="s2">bed together in a weird weird kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.510" end="01:03:10.750" style="s2">kind of sense and and that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.920" end="01:03:12.370" style="s2">polarization and that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.750" end="01:03:14.110" style="s2">polarization where both these sides</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.370" end="01:03:16.690" style="s2">don&#39;t really make any sense and then and</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.110" end="01:03:19.090" style="s2">then and then the jeddak&#39;s will dark web</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.690" end="01:03:21.370" style="s2">comes in and and right no no has these</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.090" end="01:03:22.870" style="s2">nuanced conversations where you know you</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.370" end="01:03:24.250" style="s2">can actually talk about these things</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.870" end="01:03:25.840" style="s2">again it&#39;s almost like you couldn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.250" end="01:03:27.610" style="s2">about them before I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.840" end="01:03:29.410" style="s2">had that a sense but some of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.610" end="01:03:31.900" style="s2">things were just it was you you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.410" end="01:03:34.030" style="s2">were not able to talk about but now</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.900" end="01:03:37.240" style="s2">whether you know the people with with</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.030" end="01:03:40.120" style="s2">whom you can talk about stuff like but</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.240" end="01:03:43.240" style="s2">but only with like with the hand before</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.120" end="01:03:44.740" style="s2">your mouth like let&#39;s you know let&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.240" end="01:03:46.270" style="s2">know I think there were some things that</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.740" end="01:03:49.540" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t have had the courage of</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.270" end="01:03:51.580" style="s2">saying before these guys came in exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.540" end="01:03:55.450" style="s2">I started saying him because because I</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.580" end="01:03:59.470" style="s2">because I knew that I was surrounded by</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.450" end="01:04:02.290" style="s2">virulent progressives right who wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.470" end="01:04:05.260" style="s2">who would takes who would not allow for</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.290" end="01:04:07.450" style="s2">a new nuanced conversation or even to</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.260" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">have a conversation right with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.450" end="01:04:11.890" style="s2">who&#39;s a little bit conservative like or</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:13.450" style="s2">traditional like you know Shapiro or</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.890" end="01:04:14.920" style="s2">something like you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.450" end="01:04:16.270" style="s2">couldn&#39;t had a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.920" end="01:04:18.660" style="s2">somebody like that they were just the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.270" end="01:04:21.250" style="s2">devil you know they were just you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.660" end="01:04:23.470" style="s2">evil or bad and those are the bad people</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.250" end="01:04:25.960" style="s2">over here and the good people over here</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.470" end="01:04:27.790" style="s2">and that&#39;s I think that&#39;s the essence of</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.960" end="01:04:30.310" style="s2">that the thing that I like about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.790" end="01:04:32.800" style="s2">intellectual dark web was this sort of</p>

<p begin="01:05:58.360" end="01:06:04.990" style="s2">say now in the current form I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.380" end="01:06:08.080" style="s2">necessarily support feminism although I</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.990" end="01:06:10.170" style="s2">think like women should have all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.080" end="01:06:13.900" style="s2">rights and privileges and</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.170" end="01:06:17.410" style="s2">responsibilities like they should have</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.900" end="01:06:20.110" style="s2">yeah but at the same time like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.410" end="01:06:22.120" style="s2">male I think it&#39;s good to be a male and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.110" end="01:06:24.910" style="s2">I think there&#39;s something to strive for</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.120" end="01:06:28.900" style="s2">yeah I agree and there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.910" end="01:06:30.940" style="s2">a kind of there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.900" end="01:06:32.050" style="s2">we&#39;ve been raised by females I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.940" end="01:06:34.660" style="s2">know how to say that all your teachers</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.050" end="01:06:38.500" style="s2">are females and that the transmission</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.660" end="01:06:39.940" style="s2">from the father is missing I got that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.500" end="01:06:41.950" style="s2">feeling I while I went to this men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.940" end="01:06:43.270" style="s2">group and and what one guy asked he said</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.950" end="01:06:45.100" style="s2">where do you get your information from</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.270" end="01:06:46.540" style="s2">and almost all them in there I got all</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.100" end="01:06:49.030" style="s2">their information eyes sexual</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.540" end="01:06:50.860" style="s2">information or just life information</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.030" end="01:06:52.930" style="s2">from their mothers right and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.860" end="01:06:55.390" style="s2">they were suffering so much because they</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.930" end="01:06:57.370" style="s2">didn&#39;t get that transmission from from</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.390" end="01:06:59.860" style="s2">from the father but again that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.370" end="01:07:02.410" style="s2">Peterson I think is so powerful as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.860" end="01:07:04.930" style="s2">fatherly archetype alright it was a good</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.410" end="01:07:06.520" style="s2">man archetype it&#39;s the same with gender</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.930" end="01:07:08.650" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how it isn&#39;t friends</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.520" end="01:07:10.660" style="s2">but I know how is in Germany you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.650" end="01:07:12.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like why I ask myself why is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.660" end="01:07:14.290" style="s2">why is that the topic why is it</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.520" end="01:07:16.480" style="s2">important item personally care if</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.290" end="01:07:19.000" style="s2">somebody identifies as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.480" end="01:07:21.420" style="s2">as a male or a female but what I well</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.000" end="01:07:23.890" style="s2">where I draw the line is if you start to</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.420" end="01:07:26.590" style="s2">indoctrinate the children as it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.890" end="01:07:29.710" style="s2">happening now in Germany for example so</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.590" end="01:07:31.780" style="s2">so you start with with six year old to</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.710" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">seven year olds and give them like this</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.780" end="01:07:37.240" style="s2">just gender bred man male female</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:39.520" style="s2">whatever it is you know it and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.240" end="01:07:42.190" style="s2">think that is a good idea because you</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:44.140" style="s2">know we all play I dressed up you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.190" end="01:07:47.080" style="s2">when I was that age that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.140" end="01:07:48.910" style="s2">that that I was confused in a way or</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.080" end="01:07:51.250" style="s2">that I was transgender you know that was</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.910" end="01:07:55.690" style="s2">a something I felt that I went through</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.250" end="01:07:57.369" style="s2">but now with with German Peter Kovaks in</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.690" end="01:08:03.690" style="s2">a way it&#39;s it&#39;s a complete mess because</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.369" end="01:08:06.580" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a the the intent to</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.690" end="01:08:08.320" style="s2">form their thinking in their their</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.580" end="01:08:10.930" style="s2">self-identification and I think you just</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.320" end="01:08:12.580" style="s2">have to leave them alone you know they</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.930" end="01:08:14.470" style="s2">just have to remain children and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.580" end="01:08:15.730" style="s2">know if they&#39;re gay or gay if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.470" end="01:08:17.589" style="s2">not you know late they&#39;ll don&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.730" end="01:08:19.750" style="s2">that out they don&#39;t need your you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.589" end="01:08:23.770" style="s2">they don&#39;t need a heavy-handed message</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.750" end="01:08:25.900" style="s2">to know to tell them what they are so</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.770" end="01:08:27.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s for me that&#39;s a problem but</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.900" end="01:08:31.270" style="s2">it&#39;s a straight it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.370" end="01:08:33.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange you know well you know I</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.270" end="01:08:37.239" style="s2">was looking look at look at listening to</p>

<p begin="01:09:16.150" end="01:09:20.980" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s well you know Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.279" end="01:09:23.410" style="s2">phrases good ideological positions it</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.980" end="01:09:25.719" style="s2">takes hold of people and the way out of</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.410" end="01:09:27.089" style="s2">it is these kind of conversations that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.719" end="01:09:30.839" style="s2">burn</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.089" end="01:09:34.049" style="s2">this is a conundrum I I didn&#39;t solve yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.839" end="01:09:36.150" style="s2">because I was wondering why could it be</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.049" end="01:09:38.339" style="s2">that that a consciousness or a group of</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.150" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">people like say postman and people who</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.339" end="01:09:43.770" style="s2">claim to be globalist Emperor allistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:48.119" style="s2">and multicultural and devote their time</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.770" end="01:09:52.799" style="s2">on issues like that instead of climate</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.119" end="01:09:54.780" style="s2">change so solving the the problems with</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.799" end="01:09:57.540" style="s2">the sea and the ocean pollution with</p>

<p begin="01:09:57.540" end="01:10:03.719" style="s2">they are confined to this micro problems</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:05.639" style="s2">in a way instead of well why why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.719" end="01:10:08.219" style="s2">you go ahead and solve the real problems</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.639" end="01:10:11.369" style="s2">yeah big problem so why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.219" end="01:10:16.860" style="s2">understand this why why they have the</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.369" end="01:10:19.110" style="s2">guts to UM like posed as advanced but</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.860" end="01:10:22.349" style="s2">not but not at the same time approaching</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.110" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">the problems we have and this is</p>

<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:28.170" style="s2">so why why again I think it has</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.610" end="01:10:30.449" style="s2">something to do with this infantile</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.170" end="01:10:34.080" style="s2">ization is that remaining infants for up</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.449" end="01:10:39.360" style="s2">for a long time and not not not stepping</p>
