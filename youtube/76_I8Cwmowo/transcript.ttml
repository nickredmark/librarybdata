<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">nick&#39;s books the mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">is flat and as always you can find a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:44.840" style="s2">link to that book</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">on amazon i think on our episode page at</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.840" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">jimrutshow.com</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">now this has got a little interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">history a little unusual for the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">and that i actually read the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">a while back back in late 2018 as i</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">checked for my records and i found it</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">shockingly radical</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">as maybe some of you will as we dig into</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">some of the ideas on it i</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">found it so radical i said to myself i</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">really need to read this again to come</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">to a firm conclusion about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:12.560" style="s2">but you know the russia life many other</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">books to read work to be done</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.560" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">i didn&#39;t do it until now and i said you</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">we have quite a few people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">and artificial intelligence area on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">podcast you know i really ought to reach</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">out to nick shader and give me an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.840" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">to reread the book</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">and maybe sharpen up my conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">about it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">and i gotta say it it&#39;s still radical as</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">[ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">but it holds together and what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">it&#39;s congruent</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">with a great body of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">and lab psychology research and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">retrospect</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">it should have been obvious right since</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">2014 when i really</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">took seriously to trying to learn a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">little bit about cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience i think i read</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">75 books and maybe 300 papers and i kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">of feel like thomas huxley</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">and what he said about darwin&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">how stupid of me not to thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">really it&#39;s a radical idea but i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">find any holes in it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">also for those who want to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a course available at</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">futurelearn.com</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">called the mind is flat we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">link to that on the website</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">as well at jimrutshow.com essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">what nick is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">talking about in this book is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">view that so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">have had from culture from science from</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">from clinical psychology etc that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">there&#39;s great depth in the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">and his argument is that this is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">misconceived but it&#39;s just wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">now the very idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">that our minds contain hidden depths is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">and he starts off with kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">interesting interlude</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">about anna karenina why don&#39;t you tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">us a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">that and then let&#39;s get rolling yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">well thank you so much jimmy it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">wonderful intro um</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">yes so if you read a book uh any book</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">really you&#39;ll have a sense that the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">characters are</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">very become very real to you and one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">the things that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">is that they often seem realer than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">actual people we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">or at least as real so for example with</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">anna karenina you have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">character developed through the book who</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">you have a sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">tormented and troubled woman at the very</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">end of the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">no plot spoilers are going to be um be</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">objected to as she</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">she jumps under a train and commits</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">suicide and it&#39;s not quite clear to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">as the reader why she does that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">but you have a still civil sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">rich a rich complex person and you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">it was despair at being never being</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">acceptable in petersburg society because</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">of her</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">her wild lifestyle and her her affair</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">with her lover</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">perhaps the favor the lover was failing</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">um there are any numbers of reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">feeling hopeless but also it could just</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">have been a sort of momentary sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">almost theatrical sort of making a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">theatrical gesture without really having</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">thought it through at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">you&#39;re not sure and i think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">is that you have a sense of a rich</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">character a deep interesting character</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">and one of the most the central</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">characters are one of the most important</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">um has ever written but you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">have a very clear sense of what this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">character is</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">is doing and why and one thing you might</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">think is well</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">if this was a real life character a real</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">not a fictional one then we could simply</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">ask her</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">you could say okay well i didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">seem to be a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">three-dimensional rich human being and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">you did this extraordinary acts</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">then you tell me why you did it but of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">i think when we think about that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">more it&#39;s sort of obvious to us that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">actually anna herself in contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">perhaps not very very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">contemplating her</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:57.280" style="s2">her last uh desperate act probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any particularly deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.280" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">insights we don&#39;t have ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">and she&#39;ll be able to tell you a story</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">she better think well yes i guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">what is bothering me at the moment i</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">think it must be this it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the hopeless the hopeless romantic</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">relationship like what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">tangled in right</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the fact that i didn&#39;t probably see</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">my child or it&#39;s the fact that i</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">i&#39;m going to be ostracized by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">aristocracy of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">petersburg and moscow but actually she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">speculating just as much as we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">and i think that even if you would</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">suppose imagine that she were to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">uh survive the the incident and and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">could ask her in her</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">recuperating as i imagine it in the book</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">in swiss sanatorium</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">because i look back and think through</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">why why are you engaged in that act and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">my feeling is that i&#39;m trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">sort of push on your intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">that process of looking back at</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">something one did i&#39;m trying to work out</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:48.639" style="s2">why did i do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">that&#39;s really pretty similar in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.639" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">very very similar i think to the process</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">of trying to understand why a fictional</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">character or another person did</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">your behavior looking at your uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">experiences and trying to piece together</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">what must have been going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">but what you can&#39;t do is as it were</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">look inside some kind of deep um</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">inner self and think well hang on other</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">people have to speculate about my</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">motives but i can just see them</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">they&#39;re just written in my instrument by</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">vault inside my mind you know let me</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">have a quick look and ruffle through</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">and i&#39;ll tell you what the what it says</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s we all know that to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">illusory and in fact it was if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:29.599" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">to explain their behavior several times</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:32.720" style="s2">they often give you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">different or at least not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">aligned answers because we don&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">understand ourselves so really i want</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">what i wear when i want to go</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">as an intuition pump at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">the book and obviously here too is to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">make one think well this is an odd thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">because we have a sense of a rich</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">character of anaconda we have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">sense of rich characters in people</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">around us and in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want to understand at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">the complexity of humanity human beings</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">we are standing</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">i think in some ways that the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">our mind has mental depths actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">obscures we&#39;ll talk about this later i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">sure obscures how</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">unbelievably creative and clever we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">and what extraordinary beings we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">and so i&#39;m not wanting to in any way</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">reduce</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">the remarkable nature of human cognition</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">um but i do think we should</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">sort of allow the possibility that when</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to understand my own actions</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">or anna&#39;s trying to understand her</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">actions or i&#39;m trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">the actions of another person or a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">fictional character i&#39;m really doing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">and the final point is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">think about fictional characters</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">i think this is a this is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">shocker when you think about fictional</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">characters it&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">right answer so if i ask you well come</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">on then what is what is the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:44.959" style="s2">anna jumped under the tray</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">really and truly and of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.959" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">no real answer to that because</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">it&#39;s just a story there is no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">deep um</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">question of which can be settled by</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">investigating anna&#39;s brain because there</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">is no anna with no brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">however however i think that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">the right approach</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">we should be having when we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">about other people and ourselves too</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not the case that actually if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">could scan anna&#39;s brain a critical</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">moment you could read off</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">the fact that her real motivation was</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">one thing or another</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s itself an</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">illusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">so i think the the creation of stories</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">about ourselves is something we do all</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">we can create more and less convincing</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">stories and we can argue about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">but the idea that there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">ground truth is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">is a dangerous mistake i think so it</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you cannot have</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">sensible debates about why you acted as</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">you did just as you can for literary</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">characters so if i said</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">anna&#39;s concern was i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">primarily um a despair at a state of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">service</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">you could reasonably say well that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">know signing that in the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">book doesn&#39;t seem to be it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">about them lots of other people are and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">in which case you&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">you&#39;d have a beverly good argument so</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you can say anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">but the idea that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">ground truth that you can get at</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">is no more true i think for fictional</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">characters than is of ourselves there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">at first i thought this was repetitious</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.519" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">yes i think that&#39;s it it is a very hard</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">shift to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">um and i think it&#39;s something that on</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">the one hand seems as you&#39;re hinting in</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">your introduction</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">one hand seems incredibly plausible and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">intuitive and another</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">on the other hand seems just completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">crazy and i think one</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">tends to oscillate between the two</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">perspectives and i think it takes quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">a long time to think to feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">with the fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">this sense that we have of being being</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">driven by</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">what you&#39;ve mysteriously hidden from us</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">is actually just the wrong way to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">things um so i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">i mean again i mean thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">fictional characters i think is a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">way in because because there in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">sense you want to be able to say well of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">um characters in books they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">in some loose</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">sort of metaphorical sense driven by</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">emotions emotions and some so on because</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">when i tell a story about why they did</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">what they did i&#39;ll say well</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">her motive there was this i think i</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">think she probably thought this was true</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">or she thought that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">fronski wasn&#39;t in fact being faithful to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">her or maybe she didn&#39;t um but i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">giving you a rationalization a story</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">but of course i don&#39;t really think i</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">don&#39;t really think it&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">story is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">instantiated known as anna&#39;s brain and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">she&#39;s driven her behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s the the critical</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">trick is to realize that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">really true for</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">for understanding other people and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:31.519" style="s2">ourselves either um</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">so that so one one reason to to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.519" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">this is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">when we look at the stories we tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">about ourselves of all shapes and sizes</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">whether they&#39;re complex stories or</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">everyday stories</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">about why we do things the sound and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">consistent truth is that the stories we</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">tell don&#39;t seem to fit together</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">so you ask you asked me why i did</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">something and i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:51.920" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you and you asked me well tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">me more about that why did you do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.920" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">that particular way i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">amazingly i&#39;ll just keep on talking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">you know we&#39;re amazing spinners of yarns</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">so i can keep on going as if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">this enormous</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">library full of self-understanding i can</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">draw on</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">so like why did you you take that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">particular route and say oh well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">pretty busy on</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">the other routes and and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">just a little more scenic</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">and why is it more scenic what would you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">say about what makes it more scenic and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">i can tell you a story about that and i</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">can just go on</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">indefinitely so you can either conclude</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">from this well first of all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">the richness of my explanation is</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">suspicious because every time you probe</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">more appears and you might think well</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.680" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">and and the truth is when you ask people</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.519" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">about that that&#39;s exactly what you see</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">interestingly and as i was sort of</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">this morning my reaction to reading the</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.560" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">in that i had looked quite carefully at</p>

<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">are just very fluid confabulation right</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">we just make [ __ ] up right to make the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">story as consistent as possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:56.079" style="s2">and you do go through a lot of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">of evidence so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.079" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">start talking a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">evidence that supports the argument and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">let&#39;s start with where you do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">visual processing and the grand illusion</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">yes yes so i think this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">interesting place to start because and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">something that&#39;s been much talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">in philosophy and psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">starting</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">not with alvaro and daniel dennison and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">many other</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">important philosophers and psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">and so this is the idea this question</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">but when we consider the world around us</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">sort of look about</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">we have a sense of enormous richness</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.240" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">this is an illusion that very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:31.759" style="s2">the illusion we&#39;re going to come to in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">minute it&#39;s an illusion now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.759" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">thinking just about perception not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">our beliefs and beliefs but we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">that this is very parallel</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">so we think as i look around the world i</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">think yes it&#39;s fully colorful everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">and seen in crisp and clear detail</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">if i look at a picture of some text or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">page of text i think i see words</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">maybe how many words do i see at once i</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know 50. um probably a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">whole page worth but you know a lot i</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">see that i see</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">a lot of words everywhere i look at a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">school photograph</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">i think well i&#39;m seeing it&#39;s i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">recognizing all these people</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">maybe not all the ones in the far</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">distant periphery but i&#39;m having a sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">they&#39;re also recognizable so i have this</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">really rich sense of my</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">visual environment and yet and yet we</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">that we know that is an illusion for</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:19.919" style="s2">very basic physiological reasons</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">apart from lots of clever experiments so</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.919" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">the basic very basic physiological</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">reasons which we all know very well from</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">school biology but tend to conveniently</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">forget well first of all let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">color there are two types of cell in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">eye that detect color</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">uh there were cone cells and and rod</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">cells so cone cells detect color</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">sorry detect color and rod cells just</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">really detect</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">uh particular motion if they&#39;re black</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">and white detectors</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">so they don&#39;t see color now the cone</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">cells are very concentrated in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.840" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">around the favir that&#39;s the center of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">the visual field so as i look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">part of my retina that is the light will</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">be falling on is the a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">clump of cells really dense about one</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">between one and two degrees initial</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">angle it tapers off outside that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">and that is where the cone cells live</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">now there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">around 10 degrees out except till about</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">10 degrees out there are some</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">cells but not very many so it&#39;s roughly</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">that your all of your color vision is in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">a little channel it&#39;s a bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">headlight so when you&#39;re looking right</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">at a patch of color you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">you can read off its color if you go</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">very far outside the patch</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">you haven&#39;t got the cells to do it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">simply can&#39;t possibly know what color</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">anything is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s really weird because when i</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">look at the world now i think well</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">that&#39;s just wrong isn&#39;t it i see color</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">but actually that&#39;s not the case so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">let&#39;s just hold that thought for one</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.600" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s not just color it&#39;s also detail</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">for the cells the the the cone cells in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">the fever are also what</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">process um detail detailed sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">structure and for that matter if you go</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">too far outside the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">periphery of vision the image is simply</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">blurry in fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">very blur if you went to 20 or 30</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">degrees uh out outside of the visual</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">uh center so if you look if i look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">something and think</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">how how much can i see 20 or 30 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:09.440" style="s2">off the center from where i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">um well the answer is it can&#39;t be very</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">much because the image is horrendously</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">blurry but</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">again i have no perception of that so i</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">have a sense that the world is in</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">perfectly clear focus i see all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">detail it&#39;s like see all the color</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">but we know that&#39;s wrong now where does</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">that illusion come from</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">what&#39;s driving it and i think the answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">um there&#39;s of two perspectives actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">i should say this</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not um not just one one view in</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">this area</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">then one perspective would say ah</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">filling in what your brain is doing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;s getting really detailed and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">radical information from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">favir</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of guessing about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">rest of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">so that&#39;s one possibility we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">basically guessing and when we as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">move our eye around we want to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">the guesses and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">see where they&#39;re right where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">wrong that&#39;s one possibility but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">other possibility is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">we&#39;re in fact not filling in um in fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing instead</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">is just sampling a tiny portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">and the sense that we see everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">comes from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">that as soon as i wonder about any</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">aspect of the visual image</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">if i think what color is that or what</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">words that or who&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">in the in the picture i can immediately</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">so the idea is that i haven&#39;t got the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">answer pre-loaded and i haven&#39;t guessed</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">it either</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just that as soon as you ask me if</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">i ask myself a question</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">about color or shape or the identity of</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">a word or anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">is else incredibly speedily my eye could</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">flick</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">into action look at the thing read off</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">the color or shape or</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">the identity of the word and before you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">know it in fact within a couple of 300</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">milliseconds</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">there&#39;s an answer and that&#39;s so quick</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">but essentially it&#39;s instantaneous to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">it&#39;s as if i&#39;ve got this information</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">loaded into my mind so i</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">think of myself and in some sense i</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">really am as having the world as it were</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">at my visual</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">visual fingertips ask me anything about</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">the world around me i can answer it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.039" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">according to the second view</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">to feel that the world is as it were</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">present to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">in complete detail it&#39;s not that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:10.240" style="s2">actually loaded this</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">into your brain at all is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.240" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">it ready</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">to sample and extract so speedily that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">since you can improvise the answer so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">quickly that you have the feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">the answer was</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">already there and i think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">uh first of all it&#39;s very interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">itself that our</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">intuitions about our perception are so</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">wrong so we have the feeling of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">great richness of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">sexual world and that&#39;s absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">the case in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">we&#39;re giving it an illustration of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">in a moment but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">an interesting clue about our creative</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">abilities as</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">uh and improvisational abilities as</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:48.559" style="s2">cognizers where we&#39;re phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">improvisers and when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.559" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">because we&#39;re such good improvisers we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">don&#39;t realize we&#39;re improvising</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">so we you asked me a question about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">color of some distant objects and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">tell you</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">and i think well i saw that all along i</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">knew that that color was i just you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">asked me and i&#39;ve told you but</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">i had that loaded in my head but in fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">if i wasn&#39;t looking at it i really</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">in my head but i could answer the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">question so fast it feels as if i did i</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">think that&#39;s true when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">answering questions about our</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">motivations and our beliefs and so on</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">you give me a question i can answer it</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s so speedy am i with my answer</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">that i think i didn&#39;t just make that up</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">that was in there now i knew the answer</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">i&#39;m going to give a couple of quick</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">examples in the perceptual context</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">one i think is really astounding</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">but has been known for a long time in</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">ibm research so this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">work in keith rayner&#39;s lab now dead</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">sadly a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">remarkable pioneer of eye movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">so in his early work when he was at mit</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">he went to amherst after that i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">ucsd</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">towards the end of his career very early</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">days at mit in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">he started working on a very simple but</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">paradigm so you read a sentence which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">presented to you on a screen on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">and as you do do it they track your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">so they have</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">a simple setup for watching where your</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">eyes go so you can see that the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:14.640" style="s2">quite accurately move</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">as you hop across the screen so when</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:17.919" style="s2">you&#39;re reading a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">you will be essentially jumping word by</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.919" end="00:23:21.120" style="s2">word by word roughly</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">sometimes short words get jumped over</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.120" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">and long words you read in a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">jumps</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">but essentially your eyes hopping bounce</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">bounce bounce burns bounce across the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">in discrete lumps it might actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">another illusion we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">is that it feels as if our eyes are</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">moving smoothly when we read</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">from left to right but in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">not right i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">jumps um oh and here&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">actually if we just</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">think about the illusory nature of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">perception another thing that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">interestingly true is when you move your</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">eye you&#39;re essentially blind</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t see anything while the eye is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">in motion and so you also</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">so as you look as you read you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">strange interplay of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">picking up information complete</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">blindness picking up information</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">complete blindness</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:01.600" style="s2">uh again we&#39;re completely oblivious to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">that too</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">anyway the important thing is what rayna</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:07.440" style="s2">was able to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">um with the information about where i</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.440" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">was looking and that was to feed that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">back to the computer</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">and to change what&#39;s on the screen in</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">consequence</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">so the clever trick was thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">what would it be like</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">if we give you a a line of text</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">and only where you were looking fairly</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">exactly in fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">the critical window turned out to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">about 15 characters long</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">15 characters around where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">looking in fact five going to the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">10 to the right if we read left to right</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re slightly more interested</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">in what&#39;s coming next than what we just</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have a 15 character</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">window which is unchanged untouched</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">no funny funny business but all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">other all the rest of the words in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">line of text will be x&#39;s or latin or</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">anything you like</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">so what you&#39;re going to do is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:57.520" style="s2">going to read a text</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">where as you as your eyes go from left</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.520" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">to right as they bounce across the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">the actual text itself will change so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">wherever you&#39;re looking text will appear</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:09.600" style="s2">as if you&#39;re seeing the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">sentence but when you&#39;re not looking</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.600" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">then you&#39;ve just got x&#39;s so so if i were</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">looking over your shoulder as you were</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">doing this experiment</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">i&#39;d see a line of x&#39;s with some coherent</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.840" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">text and coherent text was</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">start on the left it would go bounce</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">bounce bounce bounce bounce across the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">so to me it would seem like a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">weird thing uh i</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">see this strange pattern of orderly</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">meaningful words</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">moving across a sea of exes or latin or</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">but if i asked you in the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">you know how does that feel the answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">would be well how did what feel i was</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:41.919" style="s2">just reading some text</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">if i said well did you notice anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.919" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">funny about do you see any x&#39;s did you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">see any latin</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">the answer is no i was just reading text</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">normally there&#39;s nothing funny going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">i just read like i normally read and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">point is that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">the most shocking is that if you give</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">this kind of what&#39;s called gauge</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">contingent display so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">you&#39;re driving what they see based on</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">the location of their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">you can give them a little tiny window</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:09.279" style="s2">of information around where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.279" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">and the rest can be essentially junk and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">they will never know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">now it feels like the full text is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">available to them they can see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">sentence</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">and andrew&#39;s water in some sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">right because as soon as they want to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">let me just check back i missed the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">beginning of the sentence i&#39;ll check</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">back quickly</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">it appears just as you go to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">it appears um</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.640" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">you want to go jump and jump forwards a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">bit that will appear too</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">so you have the sense that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">full sentence is there for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.360" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">it&#39;s at your fingertips and it&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">is but it really isn&#39;t present</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">um because in fact the the stimulus has</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">large chunks that have been deleted and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">the same principle applies not just</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">text that applies to anything so if i</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">showed you a school photo</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">and you look at a particular face but</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">all the other faces are slightly blurred</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">that&#39;s you&#39;re never going to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">either as long as where whichever face</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at i make sure to unblur</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">that one just as you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">then you&#39;ll think they&#39;re all in perfect</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">focus and in fact that has to be right</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">actually where you&#39;re not looking the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">world is blurred that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">that&#39;s just the way it is it&#39;s blurred</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty colorless and it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">detailed</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">um but we don&#39;t notice because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">looking um so i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s both weird and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">in itself and i think also gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">sense that it would be slightly odd to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">think of the filling in stories being</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">right because if i if i&#39;m just reading a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">page of text it seems a bit weird to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">i&#39;m filling in all the text that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">coming and all the texts happened i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m ready yeah how could i be</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">filling in the next stuff it seems a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">of a strange perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">but i think a better better perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">is to say you know your sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:41.679" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">being real to you is the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.679" end="00:27:46.320" style="s2">asking ask yourself a question about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">and you can answer it really fast</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.320" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">and to that i think the same sense we</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">have when we think about our own</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">our own uh motivations and beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really interesting and and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">answered a question that i had while i</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">was reading i said why would evolution</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">have created this sense of more</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">completeness than</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">is really there and the answer you gave</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">is the real world is</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">relentlessly consistent for facts to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">hold good in the same world they cannot</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">be contradictory and then you also said</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">inconsistency and sparseness are not</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">just characteristics of fiction they are</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">also the hallmarks</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">of mental life so interestingly you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">i took away from your words</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">that evolution has been playing a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">clever</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">grand illusion which is to approximate</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">the consistency of the real world with</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">very sparse and inconsistent data a</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">pretty cool trick</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s exactly right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what what the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">and if we had mostly opposite subjective</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">experience if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">that every time you looked at something</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">it suddenly sprang into detail and color</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">and when you looked away it faded into</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">murky colorlessness you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">have the sense that the world was</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:02.559" style="s2">changing but the world isn&#39;t changing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">you&#39;ve just changed where you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.559" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">um and when you look back there it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">again looking um looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:09.279" style="s2">bright and colorful so we have the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">what perception is trying to tell me is</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">what the world&#39;s actually like and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">the world is not changing i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">moving my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want the brain to be saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">goodness me everything&#39;s getting very</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">there&#39;s color appearance oh it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">again it&#39;s come back detail&#39;s appearing</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">it&#39;s going it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s no actual change in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">world so i don&#39;t want to confuse the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">system by</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">by seeing changes where there aren&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">and the other point about consistency i</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">think is crucial because</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">the real world has to be consistent</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">inevitably so that means that when i</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">just of course if you&#39;re in a devious</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">psychological experiment that gets</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">strained a little bit because then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">can start to mess with people so you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">get them to look</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">look around the picture and at one</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">moment they&#39;re looking at one thing then</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">they look at it again and you can change</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">what they saw</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">and see if they noticed so you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">start to start to mess with that but but</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">normally the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">world doesn&#39;t play horrible tricks on us</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">too often and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:02.240" style="s2">and we you know we get along fine with</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">this this uh perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.240" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">but i think what we when we go wrong is</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">when we imagine ourselves introspecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking that&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">the thing is with interest with with</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a physical solid external world</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">um generating the data that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">analyzing when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">introspecting we&#39;re not looking into</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">some inner world the value is no inner</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">um our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">and our thoughts we&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">sense of our actions</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">but we&#39;re not able to do that by viewing</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">as it were viewing some of the contents</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">of some sort of inner reality</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">and the trouble is because we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">to make sense of ourselves because</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">fundamentally creative process just as</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">if we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">make sense of a fictional character or</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">another person that is not a pro there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">not a solid thing we&#39;re perceiving here</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">we&#39;re not perceiving anything um we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">inventing</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">and the inventions will turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">very very sparse</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">and also very inconsistent yeah you gave</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">a wonderful example where you move from</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">the issues with our external perception</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">to our internal perception</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">you know take a mental image and see</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">what you actually know of it you tell</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">an interesting story about the tiger</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">maybe you could tell that story</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:19.120" style="s2">yes so i think most of us have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">intuition that we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.120" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">imagine a tiger pretty pretty clearly</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">um we see ties and other things in</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">dreams and have a sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">it was very it was almost it was like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">was really there so</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">my question to myself was to think well</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">uh and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">this original example probably goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">further than this but it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">certainly to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">zenon pollution um psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">computer scientists</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">interested in in imagery so the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">is to ask yourself some questions about</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">your image of a timeline so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">that pollution</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">used to focus on is to say oh how many</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">stripes are there on its tail uh to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">which the answer is oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">well i ought to know the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">because i mean in fact imagine it like</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">but let&#39;s not leave aside the stripes of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">his tail uh because that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">uh used to be really the um the question</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:07.039" style="s2">is to think how the stripes work around</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">the body at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.039" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">so for example you might think well what</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">direction are the stripes right as they</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:12.240" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">go along the body if they go along a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.240" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">long ways or around the tiger</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">the tiger&#39;s body then what about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">legs i mean how do they go</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">um so you try to try to imagine maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">tiger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">stripes go maybe round the legs and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">maybe maybe around the body so</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">but what happens when they join together</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">and how does that how does the stripy</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">join between the legs and the body how</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">does that work and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">um it just gets very baffling now</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">if you were to look at a picture of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">tiger which i recommend that people</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">might do</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">um you&#39;ll find that actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">largely part of the tiger there are the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">crucial tricky bits to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">don&#39;t have stripes at all they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">not striped so</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">that actually some of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">you&#39;re asking yourself there&#39;s an answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a white bit well there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">no stripes there and until you look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">the tiger you just</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t imagine that at all you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">also got a question of how the strikes</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">work around the face and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just something that when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">see a side you think of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">the only way it could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">try to envisage one try and count the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">strikes try to imagine how they go how</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">they interface with each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely hopeless and i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">general sort of trick that our mind is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">playing once you get we have to sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">we can reconstruct you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">animals um people&#39;s faces uh all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">letters actually if you just try to and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">some of you when they have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">try to write a typical level lowercase g</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:34.159" style="s2">as printed in something like times new</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">roma what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">and i&#39;m just trying to imagine it now i</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">know it&#39;s pretty weird</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a g of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">handwriting that&#39;s for sure and yet this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">is something i&#39;ve seen you we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">literally hundreds of thousands that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">millions of times in our life</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">we can&#39;t even remember very clearly what</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">yeah i couldn&#39;t tell you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:54.559" style="s2">interesting yeah let&#39;s dig in a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">bit we are a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.559" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">short of time because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">interesting here let&#39;s make sure we move</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">of key on your</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">argument is that basically everything is</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">processing and that includes memory</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">which it first seems you know a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">contradictory a little off-putting</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:16.079" style="s2">but again there are arguments from</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">cognitive science that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.079" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">memories are really nothing much more</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">than snapshots of perception</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">could you talk a little bit about and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">this is an area i&#39;m very interested in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">lot of my work goes in here in the area</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">the linkage between consciousness memory</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">perception and attention</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">so maybe give your thoughts on what</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">memory traces are</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">actually and how our processing of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">memory is very similar or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">identical to our processing of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely so i think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">intuition is that we often have is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">perception is kind of front end to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">mind it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">filters the filters the input makes</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">sense of it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">store some kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">representation of the output we pop this</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">into a memory</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">uh and that memory system might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">really different from the way perception</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">works it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">next stage in the process as it were and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a very misleading way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">in fact i think it&#39;s misleading really</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">to think of memory even really</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">existing as a separate thing we clearly</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">remember lots of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">but the idea that there&#39;s a which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">somehow separate from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">the process of uh picking up and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">perceiving the information i think is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">is a misguided one so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">sometimes known as a proceduralist view</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">of memory</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">so according to this sort of idea you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">got to what you&#39;ve got is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">a set of mechanisms for for perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">or indeed for that match we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">acting on it so if you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">remembering</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">how to swing a golf club um some said</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">too that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s you swung a golf club lots of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">times maybe in which case</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.480" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">um you know that your memory for doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">that swinging is not stop it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">really stored</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">somewhere separately from the motor</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">commands that actually allow you to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">to swing the club on a particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">occasion it&#39;s just simply an</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">accumulation of all those</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">all those actions and similarly if</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about your</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">memory of of particular people or events</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">tigers those are things you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">perceived in real time as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">encountered them</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">and those perceptions leave a trace</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they produce an output a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">kind of they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">it would give their verdict and say ah</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">what happened there was this</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">i pop that in the memory bank it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">um that that the process of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">understanding the world from all away</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">from the details of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">low-level vision visual features all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">way up to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">what was happening there was that person</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">angry or happy or</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">wherever they&#39;re going with that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">implement whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">all of that is that process is simply</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">laying a trace as it were</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:52.079" style="s2">in situ so the idea from this</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:53.839" style="s2">perspective and that is rather a radical</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.839" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">idea is that if you have damage to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">part of the brain that is involved in</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">some aspects of perception you should</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">also have trouble</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">with imagining or imaging that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">and also you should have trouble</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">remembering it too unless you recoded</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">that memory in a different form</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">so the thought here would be um if if</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">for example you have area to</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">damage to an area in visual cortex which</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">is concerned with say color or motion</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">whatever it may be let&#39;s say color</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">then you will struggle to see colors</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">and process them but you&#39;ll also find</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t imagine them either</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">and also when you remember images of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">objects you won&#39;t know what color they</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">are now you might have remembered in</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.480" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">pillar boxes are red in the uk um i know</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">that i&#39;ve there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">a verb observable information i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">so in that case i can answer the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">question what color is the pillar box</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">but if i try and visualize a pillar box</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">if i&#39;ve had damage to my visual cortex i</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">can&#39;t do it because the memories are</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">stored in the same place as the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">perception or in case of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:56.960" style="s2">actions the the the memory of house play</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">tennis is stored in the same set</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.960" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">circuits that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">controlling tennis playing and i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">in general</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">we tend to miss this because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">think of perception</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">as as abstract as it really is so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">might say to yourself well yeah but i</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">mean perceiving is one thing that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">sort of knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">objects are there are what color they</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">are but when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.119" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">watching a movie or talking to a friend</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">so much more than that i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">about your intentions and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">um speculating about human nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">or i might be thinking about a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">mathematical problem and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">do a different geometry of my mind or</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">might be trying to work out how to put</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">a piece of furniture and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">things i think you should view those as</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">continuous with perception</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re all tasks which are</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:42.960" style="s2">basically taking data from the sensors</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">and trying to work out what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.960" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">and once we think of this as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">relatively abstract</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">uh not not just not just rooted in kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">the colors and shapes in front of us but</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">as a process of abstract pattern</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">construction and that&#39;s really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.960" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">really a good chunk of cognition just</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">all about that now having said that of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">course what</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:05.520" style="s2">makes us very good at this kind of task</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">is that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.520" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">just locked into the current sensory</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">input</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">so i can i can shut my eyes as it were</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">and think about lots of things which</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">where there&#39;s no sensory input coming in</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">to me because i have all those past</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:18.960" style="s2">impressions</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">past thoughts which i can which i can</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.960" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">review but they themselves are just in</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">the same format they&#39;re the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">they&#39;re just sort of past perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">traces past</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">memories memories of past perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">experiences rather than</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">being in a completely different form</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">interesting now one thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about much</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">and when i do focus a lot on my own work</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">is as you&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">that you did say that perception is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">just a simple</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">screenshot of what our eyes see because</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:50.800" style="s2">as you go through carefully</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">our eyes don&#39;t see a screenshot they see</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.800" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">a whole bunch of little things</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">but one of the high-level processings</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">which seems ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">pretty much quite a ways down in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">phylogenic stack as far as something</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">like consciousness goes</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">is the ability to find objects we</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">perceive</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">our existence in the sensorium as full</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">of objects not</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">chunks of color and shape and lines and</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.440" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">edges</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">we have it seemingly at least seems to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">me and a lot of the research i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">a very deep hardwired machine for</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">objects and in fact there appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">object store in the parietal regions of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">the brain you know the famous</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">mariah carey neuron etc that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">stimulate a specific neuron</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">and you pull up a very specific object</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">or a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">general object like dogs or tables etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">how does the concept of objects fit in</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">to your sense of perception and memory</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">yeah well i think that it&#39;s a very i</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s very central</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">concept actually um so i want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">so there&#39;s one thing i&#39;ve asked you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:59.359" style="s2">quite a lot in the book is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">that we&#39;re only we&#39;re incredibly serial</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.359" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">processors</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">so we can only really do one thing at a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">in perceptual terms i think roughly a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">way to put that is to say we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">perceive essentially one essentially one</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">so i think of an old objects as in a way</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">themselves psychologically very very</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">fundamental because they&#39;re the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">the unit</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">that the perceptual system can grab hold</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">of now that means for example that if</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">i&#39;m looking at a word</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">uh i can&#39;t see other words going back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">the eye tracker</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">as i read a sentence roughly speaking my</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">eyes jump</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:33.599" style="s2">word by word by word as i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">before you sometimes jump some more</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">words which are</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">predictable you can just guess those um</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">and for long complicated words you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:41.599" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">need to look at them more than once</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.599" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">essentially you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">read the beginning and then the end but</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">the yeah broadly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">you&#39;re picking up one word at a time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">although you have this feeling that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">receive all the other words that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">not they&#39;re not really there</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">now i think the so that&#39;s one one</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">interesting thing that the the units</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">there may be sort of basic level of unit</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:04.560" style="s2">that we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">grab hold off perceptually but another</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">interesting thing you</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">might one might think is what but aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:10.880" style="s2">words made of letters</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">so if i can perceive say a word dog well</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.880" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">i&#39;m sure i&#39;m perceiving not</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">it must be perceiving three things d o</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">and g because dog is</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">um is made of three letters so i must</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">must be able to see three things as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">as once kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">three in one trinity in case of the dog</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">but actually i think that&#39;s misleading</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">because i think if you ask people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">focus on the letter</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">they can&#39;t see the word if you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">to focus on the word they can&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:33.599" style="s2">letter at least there&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">interference between</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.599" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">them so there again it appears when</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2">intuitively first one can see lots of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">words and to see all the letters within</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.760" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">but actually i think that&#39;s not right um</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">let me give you an example from speech</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">perception which i think i&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">which is the phoneme restoration effect</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">lovely effect where you play a word and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">you splice out a bit of it and replace</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:43:00.560" style="s2">it with white noise</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">so it sounds like a word with a cough</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.560" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">and the question that the subject is</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">asked is</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">uh where was the white noise what did</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">you miss so the famous example is</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">you you pray some of the word</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">legislature and i think it&#39;s the sir</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">um you take out the sir and you just</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">replace it with a with a cough</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">as it were it&#39;s just essentially just</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">pure white ones and the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:22.720" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">where was the where was the cough and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.720" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">people are hopeless of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">they they often the great the the cough</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">to the boundaries of the words it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">just before just after</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:33.119" style="s2">and just generally they have generally</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:35.040" style="s2">have no idea what they missed</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s really very nice because</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">that&#39;s telling you that you perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">you know you heard the word in this case</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">the rather strange and unusual word</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">legislature you&#39;re pretty sure of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">but you don&#39;t actually know which sound</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">you heard um if i asked you did you hear</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">the s do you think well i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.359" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">think i probably did but you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">you didn&#39;t hear the yes that was the bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">that was chopped out</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">but you just simply don&#39;t know and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.680" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">you know that sort of phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">you think is everywhere in perception um</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">if you perceive a hole you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">perceive that the parts</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">and if you see one hole you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">perceive other holes</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">yeah a lot of that another example which</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">sorry go ahead i was going to mention</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">that you know the the field of gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">psychology has</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">been drilling into this for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">right we perceive a car</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">as a whole but if we focus and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">some even some interesting thought about</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">at what angle do you focus etc</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">a car has tires and handles and a roof</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">and a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">boot as you&#39;d say in the uk etc but when</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">we&#39;re just seeing things go by on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">road we just perceive them holistically</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">as cars it takes an additional level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">effort and attention and we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">about attention in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">to decompose an object into its</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">components but you probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">as you point out you can do one or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">other you can perceive the car as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">whole or you can perceive the tires but</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">you probably can&#39;t do both</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">right simultaneously and again this has</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">to do with this granular but probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">hierarchical structure of objects that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">we&#39;re operating in</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.280" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">let me drill into another question that</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">i had which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.319" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t other than very much in</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">passing dig into the distinction if</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">there is one and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">your work would say there isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">between the different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">memory with respect to their contents</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">and then i&#39;m thinking particularly</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:17.839" style="s2">episodic memory i.e rethinking the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">dinner i had with my daughter last night</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.839" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">versus</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:22.319" style="s2">declarative memory paris is the capital</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">of france</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.319" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">do you think there is any difference or</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">are they just projections we put on to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">what are essentially a unitary memory</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">yeah i mean i think i&#39;m not a i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a central thing in my</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:37.839" style="s2">thinking a certain point in my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">though i think it&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.839" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:41.680" style="s2">so yeah my natural my natural starting</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">point given</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">the general perspective i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">outlining is to think of everything as</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:49.440" style="s2">fundamentally episodic</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">so all you really have is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.440" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">rich collection of specific experiences</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">and you&#39;re pretty pre you run through</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">your life processing these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">as they come into you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">and they leave a trace and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">come and then those traces will</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">affect how you process the new traces</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">so essentially everything&#39;s everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:09.119" style="s2">episodes but we normally think of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">episodic memory and psychology of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.119" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">i can as it were pick out when the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">episode was</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">so if i say how do you know i know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">a particular restaurant</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:21.520" style="s2">has changed its decor you might think</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">well i know that because i was only</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.520" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">there last friday</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">not not so true at the moment of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">in a pandemic but you&#39;d think in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">normal course of events i was only there</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">last friday</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">i remember the event i remember going in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:32.319" style="s2">and thinking yeah wow they&#39;ve changed</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">that acro so you have in that case a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.319" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">sense of where the uh where the episodic</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">route is</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">and i think a semantic memory that or</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">declarative memory</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">this broader knowledge of things like um</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">the earth goes around the sun rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">than the sun goes around the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">parasitic capital france and so on</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">i think of those those things as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">fundamentally the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">episodic memory we&#39;ve just lost lost the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">episode</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">so if you ask me um who told who first</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">told you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">that paris was the capital of france and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">the answer is oh i&#39;ve just no idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just people are always</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">saying it as it were</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">and when was it that you realized that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">the earth went around the sun</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">sometime long ago i don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">difference from my mind would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">not the what you can do with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">information is just whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">traceable or not</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">now i know there are some arguments</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:22.720" style="s2">looking at for example the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">brain damage which appear to show</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">that you can get damage to one memory</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">not the other in fact the one you</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">normally get is damage to the episodic</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">system so if you believe that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:31.359" style="s2">episodes and there&#39;s this more general</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">um then it that seems to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">seems to be strengthened by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">observation that if you have certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">brain damage and also for people with</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">very severe alcoholism</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">um you can get a loss of semantic sorry</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">episodic memory so you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">have real difficulty remembering much</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">about your life and where you were</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:53.440" style="s2">yesterday and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">almost your life story starts to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.440" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">but you may still know a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">about perhaps being in</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">france that&#39;s going around the sun and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">so on um but i think actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">uh at least this is not a unique view to</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">me at all there&#39;s a very standard</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">counter to that is to say yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">actually what those people have is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:13.359" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">loss of episodes and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">shows up much worse when you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">about specific episodes because</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">specific specific episodes have been</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">damaged but if you ask them general</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">then any other number of episodes will</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">help them answer the question so if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">if you ask me about whether the paris</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">capital of france since there&#39;s lots and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">lots of memories which will turn at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">then i only have to find one of them but</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">it&#39;s really a hard question to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">what was the last movie you saw because</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">i have to pick out a particular episode</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a tough task for difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">problem and you see this all over the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">place in</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">psychology that when you have a single</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">set of tasks but some are harder than</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">others and then you damage</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">people have damage or difficulty then</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.240" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">they can&#39;t do the hard things and it can</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">do the easy ones it&#39;s easy to think ah</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">right well probably just hard and easy</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:00.720" style="s2">tasks are done by different systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">maybe different brain areas</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.720" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">that&#39;s the mistake i think what we may</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">be falling into there but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">complex and naughty area this so i</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">although i am really fond and i was fond</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">and wanting to push the episodic</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">um yeah i think that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">something i can honestly say that this</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">is a resolved question in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">interesting i actually had an idea when</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">i was reading your book in that range</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">which was</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">you talk quite a bit which we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">later that much of brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">processing is whole brain or nearly</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:32.559" style="s2">whole brain processing</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">of one snapshot at a time and then it</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.559" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">produces an output that&#39;s written to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">memory and i said hmm i wonder if there</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:42.079" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">kind of stripped down mini episodes</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.079" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">essentially where all the unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">details are eliminated and so for</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">instance there&#39;s an entity that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">looks like an episodic memory but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">rich but just says paris is the capital</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">of france</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">and every time i think that thought it</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">gets rewritten so</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">we kind of combine these two thoughts to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">the one you just said is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:03.000" style="s2">you know paris is the capital of france</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">may exist in this stripped-down</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.000" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">semi-episodic memory hundreds or</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">thousands of times</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">right so sure it would be preserved over</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">damage</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">more than others now the other form of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">memory that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">you didn&#39;t address much although again a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">little bit in passing and here</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">the evidence from damage is stronger</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">that it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">is procedural memories right we learn</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">how to play the piano</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">or ride a bike and even if we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.760" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">complete elimination of both hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.839" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">of the hippocampus that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">preserved that seems like maybe that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">a different animal</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">yeah well again i i want to say i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:39.119" style="s2">think it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">necessarily different but the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.119" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">that is different</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">is that certain kinds of procedural</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">memories are going to be engaging</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">cognitive processes so different brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:49.119" style="s2">regions</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">so if it&#39;s the case for example that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">playing the piano is</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">broadly speaking subserved by a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">relatively small subset</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">and it won&#39;t be that small but a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:01.599" style="s2">relatively small subset of brain areas</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">or such that you can lose a fairly large</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.599" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">chunk of cortex which i think you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:07.520" style="s2">and some people would have and still be</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">able to play the piano successfully</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.520" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">then because you&#39;ve got essentially</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">dedicated neural hardware for this</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.599" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">that that hardware can keep running now</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">most problems we</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">engage in don&#39;t really have or most of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">things we do in daily life don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">have a dedicated hardware</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">but if you do some repetitive tasks</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">for hundreds of thousands of hours you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">may well develop some</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:32.960" style="s2">dedicated hardware to do that task and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">reading would be another thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.960" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">to some extent language too the language</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">does use a wolf a lot of lots of brain</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">because of all the high level</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">inferential stuff to actually figure out</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">what what&#39;s worth saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">but um if you have a special dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.280" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">brain region for something</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">then then that rather breaks this idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">that you can only do one thing at a time</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">the the reason that the brain is such a</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">serial</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">process and what the reason it does one</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">thing at a time is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">it works as a giant distributed network</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">so the calculations it&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">processing it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">are spread across billions of billions</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">of neurons</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">which are all working interdependently</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">in a cooperative fashion</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">so that means that if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">solve one problem with a big cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:15.920" style="s2">network of neurons then you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:17.359" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.920" end="00:52:18.319" style="s2">network of neurons to do another problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.359" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">at the same time because they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.319" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">to get muddled up</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">so that implies that if you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">task where you don&#39;t have a special</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">dedicated piece of machinery or set up</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:30.559" style="s2">you have to cook something together on</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">the fly with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.559" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">range of mental mechanisms you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">lying around</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">that&#39;s going to take up a lot of brain</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to basically wipe out</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">the ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">anything else very complicated but if</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">you have a dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">brain with neural machinery then then</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">you may be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">run that thing and still do something</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">else so for example touch typists</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">um are able to read</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">text and type it if they practice this a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">great deal</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">while still for example holding a</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">conversation in fact they won&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">memory of what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:05.839" style="s2">been typing but they can just look at it</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">look at the text type it type it out</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">and they can think about other things</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:09.440" style="s2">they can have a chat they can do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">basically built this very very</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">specialized piece of machinery over</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">hundreds and hundreds of hours of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">i actually saw that i actually saw i had</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">a an executive assistant</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">back in the i guess it was early 80s and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">she was an old school</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:26.000" style="s2">secretary before she became an executive</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">assistant she could type 70 words a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.000" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">and carry on a conversation with me you</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">right very impressive it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s an absolutely amazing thing to see</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">yes the fact that um</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just become a sort of completely</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:42.400" style="s2">automated automated process</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">and it takes hundreds of hours to do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.400" end="00:53:45.599" style="s2">of course similarly with piano playing</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:46.559" style="s2">so when we&#39;re learning to play the piano</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.599" end="00:53:48.079" style="s2">we&#39;re learning to type it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.559" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">initially we don&#39;t have any special we</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.079" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">haven&#39;t constructed any machinery to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">it yet</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s using our whole brain is</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">struggling away</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">trying to keep the process on track so</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.960" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">any slight interruption will completely</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">scramble your typing or your piano play</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:05.280" style="s2">but once you once you&#39;re a master then</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">you can type furiously you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.280" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">play a piano piece not with great beauty</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">and expression necessarily but you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:12.880" style="s2">able to play it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">while having a conversation because that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">all of that that lower level stuff has</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:20.160" style="s2">some degree automated having said that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">this automation isn&#39;t perfect so</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.160" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">we tend to for example to imagine for</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:29.119" style="s2">example that when we&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">we can um we can uh drive on obviously</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.119" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">pilots and we think yeah i can i can see</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">that i can do that because look i can</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">have a conversation i can see the radio</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:38.400" style="s2">i can think my own thoughts and there i</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">am driving along</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.400" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">but it turns out that that&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">if most of the reason that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">such a strong sense of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">automatic driving is that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:49.280" style="s2">time when you&#39;re driving nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.280" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">and you&#39;re just going along and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">world&#39;s just flowing by</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.119" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no action to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:54:59.040" style="s2">but as soon as you have to take action</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">it tends to scramble any other</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:02.799" style="s2">activity you&#39;re engaged in so an</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:05.680" style="s2">everyday example of that is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.799" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">almost invariably if you suddenly have</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.680" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">to break</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:09.920" style="s2">suddenly while driving you&#39;ll certainly</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:11.520" style="s2">stop speaking um</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.920" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">nowhere no one carries out a fluid</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.520" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">conversation and keeps on going while</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:17.839" style="s2">slamming on the emergency stop</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">um everybody stops and you have to um</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.839" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">and the experimental work by</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">harold pachler at his lab at ucsd have</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">shown this</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">in a simulated driving task where they</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">give people a task of following along a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">car in a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">driving world and the car occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">breaks and you&#39;ve got to slam the breaks</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">of your car</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">um it&#39;s not a real car it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">all just joystick stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">um in a virtual environment but when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">you you simultaneously you you&#39;re asked</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">questions very simple questions like i</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">think something something like</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:53.200" style="s2">for example one version is you you get a</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">tone and you have to just say</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">was the tone high or low and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">say it&#39;s too soon no</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">no physical use of a keyboard or</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:05.520" style="s2">um but it turns out that if if if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">ask me whether a tone a beep is high or</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.520" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">low</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">while i&#39;m breaking i can&#39;t do both i</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">just have to do the breaking get a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">breaking out of the way and then i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.559" end="00:56:12.799" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:14.079" style="s2">what was that question and then i</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.799" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">answered the question so</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.079" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">even something where um the task in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">world is very simple</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">and the task the two things you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">to do say was that tone high or low or</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:25.839" style="s2">just keep the car on the road and break</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">when you need to they seem like totally</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.839" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">independent things but actually they get</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:29.359" style="s2">tangled up</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">so i think it makes all these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.359" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">remarkable cases like the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">people can</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">type and play the piano and and chat at</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">the same time do those</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">those things it makes even more amazing</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">because it really is the exception</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.680" end="00:56:42.319" style="s2">rather than the rule</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">cool let&#39;s move on to our next topic</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:47.599" style="s2">those who people who listen to the show</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">regularly know that it&#39;s one of my</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.599" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">obsessions which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">attention in fact i&#39;ve been known to say</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:54.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">we are our attention and it has you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.400" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">implications in all kinds of things like</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">you know social media is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">working to hijack our attention</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">you know etc and the idea of attention&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">been moved over into ai</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">for instance some of the newest work in</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:12.799" style="s2">processors like the gpt-3 thing that a</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:14.400" style="s2">lot of us have heard about recently</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.799" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">which is this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.400" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">piece of software from open ai that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:19.359" style="s2">seems to have learned a scary amount of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">language by</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.359" end="00:57:22.480" style="s2">processing a trillion words or something</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">you give it a</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.480" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">root and it goes off to the races and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">creates text it uses</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">a technology called transformer networks</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">which actually uses attention</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">as part of its model so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">is non-intuitive about our brain</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:40.559" style="s2">states and i think has huge implications</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">for the contents of our memory</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">is this idea of the unity of attention</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s single threaded</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">mostly with some exceptions that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">talk about and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">it processes by single steps in fact in</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:54.640" style="s2">my own work where i</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:56.480" style="s2">attempt to build simulated consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.640" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">how about that but for a white-tailed</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.480" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">deer</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.480" style="s2">not a human i actually make that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:02.400" style="s2">attention thing discreet</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.480" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">basically just have it change every 250</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.400" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">milliseconds or not</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:07.200" style="s2">either changes or it doesn&#39;t based on a</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">whole bunch of conditions etc</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.200" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s just single steps through</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">basically one object at a time which</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">then activates a different brain state</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">so you go in quite a bit about this this</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:20.640" style="s2">idea of the unity of attention and how</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.319" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">it emerges from the concept of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.640" end="00:58:25.040" style="s2">brain or near whole brain</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">processing so tell us about attention</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.040" end="00:58:29.520" style="s2">and how this fits in with your model</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">so yes i think jim you the way you</p>

<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">question actually encapsulates the way i</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.359" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">i think i think one should see this</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">which is to think of ourselves to think</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">say that i am my</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:43.920" style="s2">my um my attention my focus of attention</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:45.440" style="s2">and i am essentially a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.920" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">attentional snippets</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.440" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s a very very useful way</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.839" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">to think</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">um so it&#39;s very easy for us to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">that as well as the things i was tending</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.920" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">my brain&#39;s engaged in all kinds of other</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">activities and it&#39;s certainly doing some</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:58:58.480" style="s2">things it&#39;s certainly driving my</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:01.200" style="s2">heart i don&#39;t want to worry about last</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.480" end="00:59:03.839" style="s2">night it&#39;s making me breathe</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">sort of practical housekeeping things um</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.839" end="00:59:08.240" style="s2">but i would</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.640" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">want to argue that really um</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.240" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">most of the most of the activity of your</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">brain is focusing on whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2">actively doing now so if you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">playing a maybe playing a golf stroke</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re focusing on some music that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">your brain&#39;s primary primary business</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much entirely focused</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:31.280" style="s2">on that one thing and there&#39;ll be some</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">peripheral activity going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.280" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">there but</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not for example the case that while</p>

<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">think um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.079" end="00:59:41.680" style="s2">chatting to a friend as a chunk of my</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:44.160" style="s2">brain which is wondering about a tricky</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:47.520" style="s2">or there&#39;s another part of my brain</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:48.559" style="s2">which is sort of worrying about my</p>

<p begin="00:59:48.559" end="00:59:52.079" style="s2">there&#39;s another part of the brain which</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">is processing some resentment about some</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.079" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">past life from a work colleague or all</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">of this is i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">completely completely wrong and your</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:00.960" style="s2">brain is a because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">serial processor it&#39;s only really one</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.960" end="01:00:03.599" style="s2">complex thing it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:06.160" style="s2">if he&#39;s doing one thing it&#39;s not doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.599" end="01:00:08.880" style="s2">anything else um so it</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.160" end="01:00:09.839" style="s2">it&#39;s really right thing for your brain</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.880" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.839" end="01:00:13.119" style="s2">taking on one challenge at a time step</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:15.760" style="s2">by step</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.119" end="01:00:17.040" style="s2">every few hundred milliseconds is grab</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.760" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">making a new</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.040" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">stab thinking let me look from here to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:23.839" style="s2">there or move from word to word i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">review a thought i&#39;ll think i can follow</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">on with another thought</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll look at another part of the an</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">um but it&#39;s a pretty slow process which</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">pretty much blocks out everything else</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:37.200" style="s2">we do have an intuitive sense of being</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">very serial i think as a struggling to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.200" end="01:00:41.680" style="s2">do more than one thing at once</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:43.119" style="s2">and yet as with the grand illusion we</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.680" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">also have a sense that oh yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.119" end="01:00:46.640" style="s2">while i&#39;m doing this thing i can i can</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">see a fully detailed world and i can</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">hear all the sounds around me and i can</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">feel my body on the chair well i can now</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:55.680" style="s2">i think about it but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t before and i think we also do</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">have a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">implicit sort of intuition that and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.480" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">doing lots of covert pondering as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">particularly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">taking a sort of death psychology</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">perspective you have the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:07.200" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">pondering of unexpected issues in</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.200" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">unexpected ways which</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">is going on in the background but i</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">think there&#39;s no real evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.760" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the case but i think the brain is</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:18.079" style="s2">really because it&#39;s because of its the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">way it&#39;s built the fact is this this big</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.079" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">distributed system it&#39;s really hard for</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">that system to work on what two problems</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">at once with the same machinery</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve actually found that to be and</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">very interesting and challenging</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:34.079" style="s2">assertion on your part and as i thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:36.160" style="s2">about i said you&#39;re probably right</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.079" end="01:01:37.920" style="s2">i will confess to being a person who has</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.160" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">long believed in the background</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.920" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">processing because i</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">sort of felt it in myself right i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">often written software as part of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:48.079" style="s2">work that i do</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:49.440" style="s2">and you know not being a professional</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.079" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">software developer</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.440" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">you know i can easily paint myself into</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">corners and things right</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">and at you know four o&#39;clock in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">afternoon i go [ __ ] it man i just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">make any progress here</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">let me go sleep on it and i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">have the answer in the morning and</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">amazingly often</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">i do but you gave a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:08.400" style="s2">alternative</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">way of looking at that and i suspect</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.400" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">that you&#39;re right maybe you could talk a</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">your idea of resetting and get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:16.400" style="s2">assumptions etc</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:17.760" style="s2">and an alternative argument for the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.400" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">phenomena that we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.760" end="01:02:22.720" style="s2">mistake as background processing</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:24.240" style="s2">yeah i think this is a very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.720" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">intuition that we all share that</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.240" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">you you try to solve something you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">you come back and then suddenly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:31.119" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:32.480" style="s2">and it is very easy to imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.119" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">what&#39;s been going on and this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.480" end="01:02:36.480" style="s2">an old idea going back to in fact as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">strand of gestalt psychology</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.480" end="01:02:40.240" style="s2">you mentioned earlier on that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">this idea of incubation</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.240" end="01:02:44.319" style="s2">incubation problem solving the problems</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:47.119" style="s2">being mulled over</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.319" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">um intrusively even though you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.119" end="01:02:50.480" style="s2">actively addressing it</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.559" end="01:02:52.000" style="s2">and i think the uh the alternative and</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.480" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">old idea in cognitive psychology but i</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">think a very convincing one actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:03:00.000" style="s2">uh is that there&#39;s something else is</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:03:01.280" style="s2">going on so what&#39;s happening when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.000" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">trying to solve a tricky problem is</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.280" end="01:03:05.119" style="s2">you&#39;re searching</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">in space of solutions and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.119" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">you&#39;re in a cul-de-sac if you weren&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:09.920" style="s2">a cul-de-sac you keep going and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">you just think i&#39;m nearly there i</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.920" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">finally got it and you would keep going</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">till you&#39;ve got it but in fact you</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">you stop and get baffled because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:18.559" style="s2">in a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:19.680" style="s2">you can&#39;t don&#39;t know how to go forwards</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.559" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">so if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">um keep going you&#39;ve somehow got to get</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:23.599" style="s2">yourself out of the cultivation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">often quite hard</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.599" end="01:03:27.920" style="s2">in fact you&#39;ve often thought about</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:28.799" style="s2">possible ways out which clearly haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.799" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">because you you&#39;re still stuck it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">hard to generate some</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.000" style="s2">new perspective on the problem which</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">will get you out and what a break will</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.000" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">often do</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">is just reset so you just come at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:41.520" style="s2">problem you&#39;ve forgotten where you were</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:43.280" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.520" end="01:03:45.680" style="s2">because where you were was bad you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.280" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">a bad place you just start again</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.680" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">um and one so and so that&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:53.839" style="s2">now it&#39;s obvious to me is because now</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:54.559" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve started from a different</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">and that place just happens to be better</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:03:59.760" style="s2">often it won&#39;t be and something often</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">you&#39;ll just be in another bad place or</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.760" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:03.119" style="s2">place which you have to explore for a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">long time to work out whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.119" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">better or not</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:07.599" style="s2">yeah the way i articulated to myself</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">when i read your theory</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:13.039" style="s2">was that my brain activations are still</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">resonating away from the places i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.039" end="01:04:16.240" style="s2">attention say for the last half hour</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:18.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s something greater or lesser</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.240" end="01:04:19.440" style="s2">degree or somehow it&#39;s somehow impacting</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.000" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">the whole brain network everything i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.440" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">paid attention to</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:24.799" style="s2">for a while right so it&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">brain state is conditioned by what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.799" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">been thinking about for the half hour</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:30.960" style="s2">and because i&#39;m at a cul-de-sac as you</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:31.680" style="s2">said those were not the right paths</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.960" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">and just stripping all that prior</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">history of attention out or at least</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">having it way lower activated the next</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.760" end="01:04:40.559" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">allows me to whatever my internal</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.559" end="01:04:42.880" style="s2">processes are we&#39;ll get to that in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:45.119" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.880" end="01:04:46.880" style="s2">converge to something that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.119" end="01:04:49.359" style="s2">it&#39;s in a different set of attractors</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.880" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">essentially and i will say it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.359" end="01:04:52.640" style="s2">you quote some evidence that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.160" style="s2">essentially just random but</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.640" end="01:04:56.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t feel like that to me i mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.160" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">again maybe this is another illusion</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.160" end="01:05:01.200" style="s2">that i am way better the next morning on</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:02.720" style="s2">solving a stuck point in programming</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.200" end="01:05:04.880" style="s2">than i was at 4 30</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.720" end="01:05:06.799" style="s2">in the afternoon the night before so it</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.880" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel random to me and it may be</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.799" end="01:05:10.480" style="s2">that there&#39;s something deeper going</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:11.680" style="s2">on and clearing out a large amount of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.480" end="01:05:14.319" style="s2">residual</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.680" end="01:05:16.079" style="s2">brain resonances from kind of the steps</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.319" end="01:05:17.920" style="s2">of attention</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.079" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s maybe that sleep is</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:19.680" style="s2">somehow very important because i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.680" end="01:05:23.119" style="s2">some evidence that the rest and sleep</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">actually do</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.119" end="01:05:26.480" style="s2">lead to a better better rebound effects</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:27.599" style="s2">you get so so</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.480" end="01:05:29.920" style="s2">from the perspective we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.599" end="01:05:32.240" style="s2">exploring you&#39;re more fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.920" end="01:05:34.319" style="s2">shifting your play your your attractor</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.240" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">and getting unstuck more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.319" end="01:05:36.880" style="s2">so that does doesn&#39;t appear to be the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:38.480" style="s2">case but if you certainly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.880" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">trying to get experimental</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.480" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">evidence that people are really doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">incubation properly that is really</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.760" style="s2">impossible this has proved to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">excruciatingly difficult to get any such</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.760" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:49.760" style="s2">so the kind of thing you do is you give</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">people people given</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.760" end="01:05:53.680" style="s2">done so many experiments where they give</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">people for example anagrams to solve</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.680" end="01:05:57.359" style="s2">and something you can solve something</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t once you can&#39;t just kind of go</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.359" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">round and round</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">no i just can&#39;t do it and so you then</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:04.799" style="s2">give people a break and then they come</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">back and do them again and</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.799" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very rarely the case that</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:10.319" style="s2">they do much better</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:12.079" style="s2">um after a break they maybe do a little</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.319" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">bit but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.079" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">um and the length of the break doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">seem to make much difference</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:18.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s not as if you give them two</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.960" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">hours then they&#39;re much better they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.480" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">got all the anagram sources there</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:21.520" style="s2">because they&#39;ve had all that time to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">the processing</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.520" end="01:06:24.799" style="s2">um no it&#39;s not really the case um you</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:26.319" style="s2">know they may be marshalled better</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.799" end="01:06:27.920" style="s2">because they&#39;re slightly less stuck</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.319" end="01:06:30.160" style="s2">give them a nice sleep probably slightly</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.920" end="01:06:31.280" style="s2">better but it&#39;s really much more</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.160" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">consistent with</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">uh sort of diffuse nudging you out of</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">your conversation rather than</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:38.319" style="s2">my brain is just knocking off the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:41.119" style="s2">underground one after another solving</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:41.119" style="s2">the world when i look back</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.920" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">yep and i should make a note for the</p>

<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:50.480" style="s2">just in this example nick gave us each</p>

<p begin="01:06:50.480" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">claims he has backed up with actual</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.799" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">evidence and it&#39;s well footnoted and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">footnotes actually have interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:07:00.160" style="s2">discussions so these aren&#39;t just dry</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:01.520" style="s2">footnotes footnotes are worth reading</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.160" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">which is not always the case</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.520" end="01:07:04.880" style="s2">for those who you know want to have some</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:06.240" style="s2">sense of confidence and nick just isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:07:11.280" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">to myself yes i&#39;m going to hop to</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.440" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">another topic it&#39;s one that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:18.400" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t convinced of but i&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:20.480" style="s2">to say that</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.400" end="01:07:21.920" style="s2">i&#39;m right to not be convinced but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.480" end="01:07:25.200" style="s2">sort of on the bubble</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.920" end="01:07:27.760" style="s2">which is you argue that human</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.200" end="01:07:28.640" style="s2">thinking basically has no principles in</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:30.720" style="s2">it right</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.640" end="01:07:32.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not really doing our thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.720" end="01:07:34.079" style="s2">based on principles we&#39;ve somehow</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.640" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">extracted from</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.079" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">our thinking about the world and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">even make the you know to my mind fairly</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:42.160" style="s2">extreme claim that even chess masters</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">have no principles</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.160" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">they basically are just sort of clever</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">at how they remember</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">real boards and i wasn&#39;t convinced by</p>

<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:53.119" style="s2">and in fact let me play back the thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.039" end="01:07:55.359" style="s2">that kind of caused my ears to go up</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.119" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">which is that you mentioned the</p>

<p begin="01:07:56.720" end="01:08:00.000" style="s2">the chess masters are no better than</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:47.199" style="s2">surprisingly simple</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:49.279" style="s2">through all my life i&#39;ve played war</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.199" end="01:08:49.920" style="s2">games back to the days when i was 10</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.279" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">years old</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.920" end="01:08:53.600" style="s2">and they were little cardboard pieces</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">with tanks on them that you moved around</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">on a hexagonal paper board</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">through all the evolution of the online</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">stuff etc</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:03.520" style="s2">and in 2012 i learned a new computerized</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">game called advanced</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.520" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">tactics gold which is very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:11.359" style="s2">very realistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:12.400" style="s2">very good and very hard at least so it</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">seemed</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.400" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">and i sat down learned to play it it</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:17.120" style="s2">kicked my ass</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.440" end="01:09:18.560" style="s2">bad the first couple of games i got a</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.120" end="01:09:20.480" style="s2">little better a little better</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.560" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">and this is game way way way more</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.480" end="01:09:23.839" style="s2">complex than go in fact</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">some calculations i did said the average</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.839" end="01:09:29.040" style="s2">number of move possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">is 10 to the 60th per turn 10 to the</p>

<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:35.679" style="s2">as opposed to maybe 200 and go and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:36.480" style="s2">30 in chess and five or six in checkers</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.679" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">droughts</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.480" end="01:09:39.520" style="s2">so anyway and then i also stopped and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:41.520" style="s2">thought about it a little bit how many</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.520" end="01:09:42.319" style="s2">of these war games have i played in my</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.520" end="01:09:45.199" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">and gross estimate at that point was i</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.199" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">probably played</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:50.000" style="s2">a game to conclusion 2500 times in my</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.000" end="01:09:53.359" style="s2">which is a very low number compared to</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.239" end="01:09:55.760" style="s2">machine learning</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.359" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">right continue to story advanced tactics</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.760" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">gold good game people if you like games</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:02.480" style="s2">check it out it&#39;s on steam</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:05.040" style="s2">after seven games i had basically</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.480" end="01:10:06.560" style="s2">extracted enough and i would argue</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.040" end="01:10:09.120" style="s2">applied my principles</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:10.800" style="s2">enough so the sucker never beat me again</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:12.640" style="s2">i probably played it a few hundred times</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.800" end="01:10:13.199" style="s2">since then 100 times at least one every</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.640" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.199" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">sometimes difficult to win but i&#39;ve won</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:19.600" style="s2">and you know what we know about</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">machine learning there&#39;s no way you</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.600" end="01:10:23.440" style="s2">could get that good on only playing</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:25.760" style="s2">a hundred times impossible right there</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.440" end="01:10:29.920" style="s2">has to be something else going on</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s my push back on no principles</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.920" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">well i think it depends what you count</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:33.679" style="s2">as a principle because i think what</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.679" end="01:10:37.040" style="s2">pushing back on is something i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.040" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">extremely sympathetic to so</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.040" end="01:10:40.080" style="s2">if you think about how machine learning</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:43.600" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.080" end="01:10:44.880" style="s2">as a model for the mind which i think is</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.600" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">an interesting thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.880" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">then the shocking thing is that it needs</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:49.600" style="s2">so much data</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:51.920" style="s2">exactly as you&#39;re saying you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.600" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">enormous space of possible games</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.920" end="01:10:54.960" style="s2">and you play in a tiny subspace and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:57.600" style="s2">and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.960" end="01:10:58.159" style="s2">learned to play pretty well and and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.600" end="01:10:59.920" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.159" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">start to win even though you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.920" end="01:11:03.360" style="s2">possibly be doing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.199" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">by in some simple-minded way comparing</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.360" end="01:11:07.199" style="s2">the current um game with previous games</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:07.920" style="s2">because the space is just way way too</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.199" end="01:11:10.560" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.920" end="01:11:10.960" style="s2">um now i think that&#39;s absolutely true so</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.560" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.960" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">one view of what&#39;s going on is that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:16.080" style="s2">brain must have</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.280" style="s2">the ability that machine learning</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:21.719" style="s2">systems don&#39;t have to work out some</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:22.960" style="s2">underlying as it was sort of perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.719" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">quasi-mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.960" end="01:11:27.440" style="s2">set of rules of rules which tell you how</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">to play well</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.440" end="01:11:31.520" style="s2">so instead of just thinking oh i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">a position like this before</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.520" end="01:11:34.880" style="s2">and i did this and it didn&#39;t work i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">do something else or</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">it did work so i&#39;ll do it again instead</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:40.320" style="s2">of doing something like that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:41.760" style="s2">you&#39;re somehow breaking breaking out and</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.320" end="01:11:43.280" style="s2">having some sort of general</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.760" end="01:11:44.640" style="s2">understanding such a general theory of</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.280" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">how to play the game</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.640" end="01:11:49.360" style="s2">now i think that is wrong i think the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:51.679" style="s2">brain doesn&#39;t do that very well</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.360" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">and we have intuitions about how we play</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.679" end="01:11:56.320" style="s2">chess or go or any game um but the</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">intuitions are pretty poor so when</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.320" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">as i&#39;m sure you know when people started</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">to build chess playing computers they</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">one of the first things they had to go</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:05.360" style="s2">at is just asking chess players</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">um well what how did you create you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.360" end="01:12:08.800" style="s2">got to play good chess</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">which is a very sensible thing to do and</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.800" end="01:12:12.159" style="s2">but actually chest pose can&#39;t say very</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.719" end="01:12:13.360" style="s2">much they can certainly say things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.159" end="01:12:14.159" style="s2">well the queen you don&#39;t want to lose</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.360" end="01:12:15.600" style="s2">your queen and</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.159" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">don&#39;t rush your king into an attack</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.600" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a mistake and control</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:20.400" style="s2">the center of the board</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:21.440" style="s2">and and other things which are not not</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.400" end="01:12:23.199" style="s2">worthless</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.440" end="01:12:25.280" style="s2">but they are fairly even complete and</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.199" end="01:12:28.719" style="s2">minimal so famously</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.280" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">um you have books uh also some great</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.719" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">russian grand master has a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:33.120" style="s2">wonderfully titled book which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:34.400" style="s2">something like principles of chess</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.120" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">strategy or something</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.400" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">and what does the book contain what it</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">contains is a stack of cool examples</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:43.600" style="s2">like famous games puzzle tricky problems</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">with an explanation intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.600" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">explanation of how to deal with this</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:48.320" style="s2">kind of case</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">now but what it doesn&#39;t do is say now</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.320" end="01:12:51.920" style="s2">the principles of chess here they are</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:53.280" style="s2">and of course the if we if we knew the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.920" end="01:12:55.679" style="s2">principles of chess if they</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.280" end="01:12:56.880" style="s2">were um that would be useful then</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.679" end="01:12:58.400" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.880" end="01:12:59.920" style="s2">building chest pain computers would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.400" end="01:13:01.520" style="s2">much easier than tears</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.920" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">so i think the right lesson to draw from</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.520" end="01:13:05.440" style="s2">that kind of case is to think well</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:06.640" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about human learning</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.440" end="01:13:08.320" style="s2">this is what the</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.640" end="01:13:09.679" style="s2">prince of quote supposed principles of</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:12.800" style="s2">chess book is telling you is</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.679" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s saying think deeply and</p>

<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">so you&#39;re not just storing them as it</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.400" end="01:13:22.000" style="s2">were as raw data thinking if i see raw</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:22.880" style="s2">data it looks a bit like this again i</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.000" end="01:13:24.560" style="s2">know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.880" end="01:13:25.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing that you&#39;re thinking in</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.560" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">a very rich</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.920" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">metaphorical and logical way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">now what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">what kind of thing is this have i seen</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:35.440" style="s2">anything a bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">like this before and i think this is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.440" end="01:13:39.600" style="s2">ability that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.560" end="01:13:40.560" style="s2">astonishing that makes us so remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.600" end="01:13:43.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.560" end="01:13:45.360" style="s2">we can play chess by working out sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.920" end="01:13:47.040" style="s2">as a worse of mathematical principles</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.360" end="01:13:47.679" style="s2">about what to do how to play every chess</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.040" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.679" end="01:13:52.800" style="s2">but what we can do is think this</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:54.960" style="s2">position i&#39;m in now reminds me</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.800" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">possibly implicitly of a number of other</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.960" end="01:13:58.960" style="s2">positions in those positions</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:14:00.159" style="s2">there&#39;s the kind of thing i did was this</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.960" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">so probably this is the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.159" end="01:14:04.000" style="s2">i&#39;m going to do now so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.840" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">higher more abstract level now how that</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.000" end="01:14:09.199" style="s2">works how the brain is able to</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:10.880" style="s2">operate at this more abstract level so</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.199" end="01:14:12.719" style="s2">that it can</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.880" end="01:14:14.400" style="s2">learn not just from the very specific</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.719" end="01:14:15.520" style="s2">ball position but they&#39;re classical</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.400" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">positions i mean how that</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.520" end="01:14:19.199" style="s2">that works is the kind of holy grail of</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:21.040" style="s2">cognitive science and ai in my view it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.199" end="01:14:22.640" style="s2">kind of thing that doug have hofstrata</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.040" end="01:14:24.320" style="s2">that was it was doing so much so much</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.640" end="01:14:27.600" style="s2">work on</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.320" end="01:14:29.120" style="s2">40 years ago and and for ongoing to try</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.600" end="01:14:30.400" style="s2">to understand sort of fluidity and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.120" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">creativity of our</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.400" end="01:14:34.480" style="s2">ability to deal with particular</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:35.440" style="s2">experiences extracting sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.480" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">analogically</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.440" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">this this is the case a bit like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:39.679" style="s2">previous case um and doing that in a way</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.679" end="01:14:43.760" style="s2">is sort of coherent and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.480" end="01:14:45.040" style="s2">remarkable we can do it but i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.760" end="01:14:47.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.040" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">um because if we were producing</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.120" end="01:14:50.640" style="s2">principles well first of all we never</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">people can never articulate them but</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.640" end="01:14:54.800" style="s2">also most complicated</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:14:56.960" style="s2">problems and your game will absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.800" end="01:14:59.199" style="s2">one of these i&#39;m sure there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.960" end="01:15:00.800" style="s2">algorithm the algorithm if there is an</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.199" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">algorithm to play to play that game well</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:04.080" style="s2">it&#39;s almost certainly</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:05.280" style="s2">a very memory based algorithm it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.080" end="01:15:07.040" style="s2">situations like this do this in</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.280" end="01:15:09.440" style="s2">situations like this do this other thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.040" end="01:15:10.400" style="s2">it won&#39;t be a something sort of more</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.440" end="01:15:12.239" style="s2">abstract than that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.400" end="01:15:13.760" style="s2">so i think if you want to call those</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.239" end="01:15:14.560" style="s2">principles that more abstract way of</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.760" end="01:15:16.640" style="s2">seeing the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.560" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">then that&#39;s that that&#39;s that&#39;s that i</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.640" end="01:15:18.480" style="s2">think that absolutely is what the brain</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">is doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.480" end="01:15:22.320" style="s2">but what it&#39;s not doing i think is is</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:24.080" style="s2">producing a</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.320" end="01:15:26.080" style="s2">set of rules are a kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.080" end="01:15:27.040" style="s2">theory which is a consistent</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.080" end="01:15:28.400" style="s2">understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.040" end="01:15:30.960" style="s2">how to play the game or how the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.400" end="01:15:32.960" style="s2">works or anything of that kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.960" end="01:15:34.640" style="s2">yeah i agree 100 in fact the word i</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.960" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">always use i didn&#39;t use principles i</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.640" end="01:15:39.440" style="s2">just used your word principles</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:40.000" style="s2">i call those heuristics and in fact my</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.440" end="01:15:41.840" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:43.520" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll succeed because</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.840" end="01:15:44.960" style="s2">i&#39;m too old god damn it i wish i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.520" end="01:15:45.760" style="s2">started this when i was younger instead</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.960" end="01:15:49.760" style="s2">of when i was</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.760" end="01:15:52.719" style="s2">60 years old is heuristic induction</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.760" end="01:15:53.920" style="s2">how is it that we induce heuristics</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.719" end="01:15:55.679" style="s2">because there&#39;s no doubt about</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.920" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">at least based on my introspection but</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.679" end="01:15:59.440" style="s2">as you point out our introspection is</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:16:00.000" style="s2">dubious when i&#39;m playing my game or any</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.440" end="01:16:01.840" style="s2">games and</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.000" end="01:16:03.360" style="s2">in fact since i did all that work with</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.840" end="01:16:05.120" style="s2">advanced tactics gold i even got the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.360" end="01:16:07.199" style="s2">source code from the developer and</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.120" end="01:16:08.719" style="s2">wrote some evolutionary algorithms that</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.199" end="01:16:10.640" style="s2">improved his ai</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.719" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve played some other games and i just</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.640" end="01:16:14.080" style="s2">see again and again and again</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:16.480" style="s2">i develop heuristics which are</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.080" end="01:16:17.199" style="s2">definitely not algorithms you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.480" end="01:16:20.560" style="s2">that these</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.199" end="01:16:22.480" style="s2">five or six or seven rules of thumb</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.560" end="01:16:23.920" style="s2">for that particular game are quite</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.480" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">enough to win</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.920" end="01:16:27.440" style="s2">but if you have a brain that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">tuned to extract</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.440" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">patterns from games you can then apply</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.000" end="01:16:32.719" style="s2">the heuristics in a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:34.400" style="s2">straightforward fashion</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.719" end="01:16:36.080" style="s2">for instance is a whole class of games</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.400" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">where it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.080" end="01:16:40.480" style="s2">that you keep your line consistent</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">across the board so guys can&#39;t get past</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.480" end="01:16:43.120" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:45.280" style="s2">right kind of true in chess but really</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.120" end="01:16:46.719" style="s2">true in some of these military games</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.280" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.719" end="01:16:48.719" style="s2">you learn when you play one of these</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:51.520" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.719" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">is the relative efficacy of defense</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.520" end="01:16:55.040" style="s2">versus attack</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">for instance having played several</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.040" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">hundred titles over my life maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2">thousand now probably several hundred</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.040" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">a meta pattern is that often</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">it turns out to be true in real life in</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:07.840" style="s2">war as well</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:09.679" style="s2">that it&#39;s often better to take the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.840" end="01:17:11.199" style="s2">tactical defensive and get the other guy</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.679" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">to attack you first and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.199" end="01:17:14.159" style="s2">counter-attack</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:16.640" style="s2">right that turned out to have been the</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.159" end="01:17:17.360" style="s2">tactical brilliance of the german army</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.640" end="01:17:19.679" style="s2">in world war</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.360" end="01:17:20.400" style="s2">ii particularly in the later phases of</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.679" end="01:17:23.679" style="s2">the war</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.400" end="01:17:26.880" style="s2">so this is heuristics and how we induce</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.679" end="01:17:27.840" style="s2">heuristics from these otherwise flat</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.880" end="01:17:29.600" style="s2">patterns i think</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.840" end="01:17:30.960" style="s2">is still a huge open question and is</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.600" end="01:17:32.880" style="s2">right at the very core of my own</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.960" end="01:17:34.560" style="s2">interest in this space</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.880" end="01:17:35.920" style="s2">yeah and i think i think as you were</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:37.199" style="s2">hinting it&#39;s at the very core of</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.920" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">intelligence really</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.199" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">and what is astonishing is that is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:43.440" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.880" end="01:17:44.560" style="s2">produce these sort of rough patterns</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.440" end="01:17:46.719" style="s2">heuristics and so on</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.560" end="01:17:48.400" style="s2">and they um they are as you say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.719" end="01:17:49.600" style="s2">not sufficient on their own to solve the</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.400" end="01:17:51.199" style="s2">problem if you coded those</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.600" end="01:17:52.400" style="s2">into a computer that would it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.199" end="01:17:54.080" style="s2">be a winning computer it wouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.400" end="01:17:56.080" style="s2">winning system on its own</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.080" end="01:17:57.679" style="s2">um but if you put that together with a</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.080" end="01:17:59.520" style="s2">creative flexible brain that can somehow</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.679" end="01:18:01.120" style="s2">know which heuristic is the right one to</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.520" end="01:18:02.480" style="s2">deploy and when there&#39;s a clash thing no</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.120" end="01:18:03.760" style="s2">no this is clearly a case but this one</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.480" end="01:18:04.800" style="s2">much more important than that one but</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.760" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">there may be some other case where the</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.800" end="01:18:07.520" style="s2">when it</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:08.800" style="s2">where it&#39;s the reverse that ability to</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.520" end="01:18:11.760" style="s2">kind of knit together</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.800" end="01:18:13.440" style="s2">a difference of these heuristics is very</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.760" end="01:18:16.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s very remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.440" end="01:18:17.360" style="s2">um and i think you know it&#39;s we are we</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.000" end="01:18:20.560" style="s2">do forget just how</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.360" end="01:18:22.480" style="s2">unbelievably good we are at</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.560" end="01:18:23.600" style="s2">finding complicated patterns in very</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.480" end="01:18:26.400" style="s2">small amounts of data</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:28.159" style="s2">and so in fact you can play a game the</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.400" end="01:18:29.440" style="s2">normal space of possible moves and get</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.159" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">pretty good at it quickly that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.440" end="01:18:32.800" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">um similarly and science manages to</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.800" end="01:18:35.520" style="s2">produce principles and it really does</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:36.719" style="s2">produce principles they&#39;re not in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.520" end="01:18:37.600" style="s2">heads of the scientists directly with</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.719" end="01:18:40.080" style="s2">other things we actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.600" end="01:18:41.120" style="s2">produce as a community the same in</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.080" end="01:18:43.280" style="s2">sciences which would be very</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.120" end="01:18:45.199" style="s2">successful such as physics um you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.280" end="01:18:46.400" style="s2">amazingly it turns out you can produce</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.199" end="01:18:48.239" style="s2">um a relatively small number of</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.400" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">principles which explain a huge amount</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.239" end="01:18:51.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:52.400" style="s2">of reality and so you know but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.360" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">not doing that by</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.400" end="01:18:56.000" style="s2">as it was surveying the universe and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:57.520" style="s2">just taking in as much data as you</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.000" end="01:18:59.760" style="s2">possibly can in fact</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.520" end="01:19:00.960" style="s2">you&#39;re narrowing down a tiny tiny amount</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.760" end="01:19:04.239" style="s2">of data you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:05.360" style="s2">carefully dropping balls down slopes of</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.239" end="01:19:06.800" style="s2">different inclines and</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.360" end="01:19:08.800" style="s2">carefully watching pendulums go</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.800" end="01:19:09.520" style="s2">backwards and forwards and remarkably it</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.800" end="01:19:11.600" style="s2">turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.520" end="01:19:13.280" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this leads you to</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.600" end="01:19:13.920" style="s2">generalizations which which helps you</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.280" end="01:19:15.520" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.920" end="01:19:16.960" style="s2">the universe as a whole it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.520" end="01:19:18.560" style="s2">amazing thing and</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.960" end="01:19:20.480" style="s2">but it really doesn&#39;t work by being a</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.560" end="01:19:21.600" style="s2">kind of data hoover uh the way the way</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.480" end="01:19:23.600" style="s2">that machine learning is</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.600" end="01:19:25.280" style="s2">which is the kind of take your trigger</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.600" end="01:19:25.679" style="s2">words retrieving images and just find</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.280" end="01:19:27.440" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.679" end="01:19:28.880" style="s2">find the structure in all of them the</p>

<p begin="01:19:28.880" end="01:19:32.239" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.640" end="01:19:34.960" style="s2">yeah it is interesting and you know and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.239" end="01:19:36.640" style="s2">we alluded to it a little bit in passing</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.960" end="01:19:38.640" style="s2">that one of the other cutting edge</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.640" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">things you know learning on small data</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.640" end="01:19:42.480" style="s2">is something people are quite aware of</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">as the distinction between humans and</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.480" end="01:19:45.520" style="s2">data in fact i noticed you had in your</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">acknowledgement section my friend</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.520" end="01:19:51.600" style="s2">josh tenenbaum has done a lot of work</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.560" end="01:19:53.760" style="s2">on small sample learning and ways that</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.600" end="01:19:55.600" style="s2">are rather different than brute force</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.760" end="01:19:56.800" style="s2">machine learning and you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.600" end="01:19:58.640" style="s2">very hot area but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.800" end="01:20:00.239" style="s2">the other area where this is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.640" end="01:20:01.040" style="s2">lot of tension right now is about</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.239" end="01:20:04.159" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.040" end="01:20:05.760" style="s2">right particularly with the new 3 out</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.159" end="01:20:06.480" style="s2">which we alluded to earlier is this</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.760" end="01:20:09.040" style="s2">massive</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.480" end="01:20:10.080" style="s2">trillion word database that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.040" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">processed by</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.080" end="01:20:14.880" style="s2">several billion node deep learning</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">network to produce a language model</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.880" end="01:20:19.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s scary how good it is however it</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:21.440" style="s2">does not appear</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.040" end="01:20:23.040" style="s2">to actually understand language it</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.440" end="01:20:24.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.040" end="01:20:28.159" style="s2">to trick it</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.080" end="01:20:31.280" style="s2">and so probably human language learning</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.159" end="01:20:33.280" style="s2">is something different than just</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.280" end="01:20:34.800" style="s2">brute force pattern matching on a</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.280" end="01:20:36.239" style="s2">trillion words well you know frankly we</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.800" end="01:20:36.719" style="s2">know we don&#39;t get exposed to a trillion</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.239" end="01:20:39.120" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.719" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">we have pretty good mastery of language</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.120" end="01:20:42.719" style="s2">by the time we&#39;re what you guys work on</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:43.280" style="s2">that language three or four years old</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.719" end="01:20:45.120" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.280" end="01:20:47.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great for you pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.120" end="01:20:48.960" style="s2">yeah yeah again something like</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.280" end="01:20:50.719" style="s2">principles something like</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.960" end="01:20:52.480" style="s2">probably not chomsky and universal</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.719" end="01:20:55.679" style="s2">grammar but something like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.480" end="01:20:56.960" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s there well i think i think</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.679" end="01:20:58.639" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.960" end="01:21:00.560" style="s2">it&#39;s going back to the point that</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.639" end="01:21:03.440" style="s2">cognition for me is perception</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.560" end="01:21:04.560" style="s2">i i want to see all of these cases as</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.440" end="01:21:06.880" style="s2">cases where</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.560" end="01:21:08.320" style="s2">you&#39;re abstracting from specific</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.880" end="01:21:09.600" style="s2">concrete experiences but you may be</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.320" end="01:21:10.719" style="s2">abstracting at quite a high level of</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.600" end="01:21:12.239" style="s2">generality</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.719" end="01:21:13.760" style="s2">so in learning a language you see</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.239" end="01:21:15.120" style="s2">something like what christians</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.760" end="01:21:16.960" style="s2">and i have been thinking about a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.120" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">the last few years you should think of</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.960" end="01:21:20.000" style="s2">learning a language as learning a skill</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:20.719" style="s2">which might intuitively sound to most</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.000" end="01:21:22.000" style="s2">people as</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.719" end="01:21:24.400" style="s2">very natural of course it&#39;s learning a</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.000" end="01:21:26.639" style="s2">skill is</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.400" end="01:21:28.320" style="s2">no more or less than playing a piano or</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.639" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">learning to play a sport</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.320" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">um or need a game um but traditionally</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:35.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not viewed like that it&#39;s viewed as</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:36.719" style="s2">uh at least in chomsky&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.840" end="01:21:38.320" style="s2">it&#39;s viewed as</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:40.239" style="s2">a problem of learning a body of</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.320" end="01:21:41.120" style="s2">knowledge but not a body of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.239" end="01:21:44.159" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.120" end="01:21:45.440" style="s2">tells you how what sentences are</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.159" end="01:21:47.600" style="s2">allowed in your language and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.440" end="01:21:48.639" style="s2">composed and that abstract body of</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.600" end="01:21:51.440" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.639" end="01:21:52.639" style="s2">is a real target of learning and that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.440" end="01:21:56.080" style="s2">supposed to take you</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.639" end="01:21:56.400" style="s2">far beyond mere skill learning um but i</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.080" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.400" end="01:22:00.159" style="s2">the approach that maureen and i and</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.800" end="01:22:03.679" style="s2">others many others</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.159" end="01:22:05.199" style="s2">would take is to see language as</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.679" end="01:22:06.560" style="s2">an abstraction from lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.199" end="01:22:07.280" style="s2">concrete experiences so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.560" end="01:22:09.600" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.280" end="01:22:10.880" style="s2">is you&#39;re learning specific words you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.600" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">learning specific patterns of words</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.880" end="01:22:12.960" style="s2">you&#39;re learning specific relationships</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:15.120" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.960" end="01:22:17.120" style="s2">singulars and plurals and so on in verbs</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.120" end="01:22:19.360" style="s2">and nouns and all of these patterns</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.120" end="01:22:21.040" style="s2">and constructions are there is the term</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.360" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">of art in linguistics at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.040" end="01:22:23.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">um the movement construction grammar</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.760" end="01:22:26.639" style="s2">specifications takes the</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:29.280" style="s2">that takes this kind of perspective</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.639" end="01:22:30.960" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.280" end="01:22:32.480" style="s2">task of learning languages learning all</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.960" end="01:22:35.520" style="s2">these little micro patterns</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.480" end="01:22:37.440" style="s2">and they gradually build up and interact</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.520" end="01:22:39.440" style="s2">to give you a complicated system</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.440" end="01:22:41.120" style="s2">which is the system system of language</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.440" end="01:22:42.480" style="s2">we that we speak</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.120" end="01:22:44.320" style="s2">but really you&#39;re learning it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.480" end="01:22:45.520" style="s2">piece by piece by piece but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.320" end="01:22:47.440" style="s2">learning it as a</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.520" end="01:22:48.960" style="s2">as a set of sort of chunks of</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.440" end="01:22:49.679" style="s2">information so chunks of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.960" end="01:22:52.800" style="s2">you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.679" end="01:22:54.560" style="s2">about particular um particular noun verb</p>

<p begin="01:23:09.360" end="01:23:14.960" style="s2">there&#39;s some very interesting</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.040" end="01:23:30.000" style="s2">typical child will hear a few million</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.719" end="01:23:31.760" style="s2">up to perhaps 30 million or so</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.000" end="01:23:33.760" style="s2">in a very high linguistic input</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.760" end="01:23:36.320" style="s2">household so 30 million words a year</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.760" end="01:23:37.760" style="s2">so you a four year old might have heard</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.320" end="01:23:39.199" style="s2">it might between 10 and 100 million</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.760" end="01:23:41.679" style="s2">depending on the household</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.199" end="01:23:42.800" style="s2">words most of which it would have been</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.679" end="01:23:45.920" style="s2">paying no attention to and</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.800" end="01:23:46.239" style="s2">probably made no difference at all but</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.920" end="01:23:49.120" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.239" end="01:23:50.159" style="s2">way too little as you say than for a</p>

<p begin="01:23:50.159" end="01:23:53.520" style="s2">and the child&#39;s also got the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.679" end="01:23:55.679" style="s2">course of doing all the phonology just</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.520" end="01:23:58.080" style="s2">looking at what were those sounds um</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.679" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">how do i i don&#39;t know just understanding</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.080" end="01:24:02.960" style="s2">the speech signal as an acoustic object</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:05.199" style="s2">and translating that acoustic</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.960" end="01:24:06.960" style="s2">stimulus into a symbolic form that</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.199" end="01:24:08.719" style="s2">itself is a huge learning task</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.960" end="01:24:10.800" style="s2">so the child&#39;s learning fee is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.719" end="01:24:13.040" style="s2">pretty remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.800" end="01:24:14.159" style="s2">indeed indeed we&#39;re you know running a</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.040" end="01:24:16.159" style="s2">little bit short on time here i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.159" end="01:24:19.199" style="s2">to skip over a whole section on folk</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.159" end="01:24:21.760" style="s2">physics folk biology and folk psychology</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.199" end="01:24:23.760" style="s2">and the failure of good old-fashioned ai</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.760" end="01:24:25.199" style="s2">which is more or less implied by the</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.760" end="01:24:26.880" style="s2">failure of those two but i would</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.199" end="01:24:27.920" style="s2">encourage listeners to read the book and</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.880" end="01:24:29.679" style="s2">go into that</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.920" end="01:24:31.120" style="s2">something that i think is going to be of</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.679" end="01:24:34.159" style="s2">real interest to folks</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.120" end="01:24:36.080" style="s2">is i thought a very clever</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.159" end="01:24:37.280" style="s2">set of arguments on the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.080" end="01:24:39.600" style="s2">emotion</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.280" end="01:24:41.440" style="s2">we think of oh you know i&#39;m feeling you</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.600" end="01:24:42.400" style="s2">know anger or whatever that it&#39;s a pure</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.440" end="01:24:43.600" style="s2">emotion well</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.400" end="01:24:46.080" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this distinction</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.600" end="01:24:47.440" style="s2">between emotions and feelings</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.080" end="01:24:49.679" style="s2">in the cognitive science literature</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:51.440" style="s2">emotions in the body feelings in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.679" end="01:24:53.440" style="s2">head roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.440" end="01:24:55.120" style="s2">and you give some very clever examples</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.440" end="01:24:57.040" style="s2">on how that&#39;s probably right</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.120" end="01:24:58.560" style="s2">and one i had forgotten all about the</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.040" end="01:25:00.960" style="s2">kuleshov effect</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.560" end="01:25:02.719" style="s2">so maybe if you talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.960" end="01:25:06.159" style="s2">how your overall model</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.719" end="01:25:09.040" style="s2">predicts actually i think accurately</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.159" end="01:25:10.960" style="s2">sort of body plus context equals emotion</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.040" end="01:25:12.800" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:14.320" style="s2">yes absolutely so so perhaps i&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.800" end="01:25:16.880" style="s2">with the kudos effect so lev</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.320" end="01:25:18.719" style="s2">kuderschoff was a a soviet director in</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.880" end="01:25:21.920" style="s2">the early part of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.719" end="01:25:24.320" style="s2">and he noticed the effect the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.920" end="01:25:25.679" style="s2">the effect that bears his name which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:28.560" style="s2">if you show</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.679" end="01:25:30.320" style="s2">us say even still other could also be</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.560" end="01:25:32.480" style="s2">moving a still image of</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.320" end="01:25:34.239" style="s2">a person and you change the context</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.480" end="01:25:37.520" style="s2">they&#39;re in although this image of them</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.239" end="01:25:40.560" style="s2">is exactly exactly the same then they</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.520" end="01:25:42.239" style="s2">will um the viewer will interpret the</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.560" end="01:25:45.520" style="s2">facial expression differently</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.239" end="01:25:47.120" style="s2">so the famous example is is of a one of</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.520" end="01:25:49.920" style="s2">his actors even mozuki</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.120" end="01:25:50.639" style="s2">who has a rather impassive expression in</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.920" end="01:25:53.120" style="s2">the example</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.639" end="01:25:54.320" style="s2">that is in the book and you place him</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.120" end="01:25:56.400" style="s2">next to a picture</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.320" end="01:25:57.360" style="s2">of a dead child as you mock up with each</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.400" end="01:26:00.320" style="s2">other but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.360" end="01:26:01.040" style="s2">sad looking picture of a child in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.320" end="01:26:02.400" style="s2">coffin</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.040" end="01:26:04.239" style="s2">and you look at his face and you look at</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.400" end="01:26:05.040" style="s2">the coffin you think he&#39;s expressing</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.239" end="01:26:07.520" style="s2">misery</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.040" end="01:26:08.400" style="s2">this desperate sense of sadness which is</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.520" end="01:26:09.679" style="s2">controlling it</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.400" end="01:26:12.159" style="s2">but you can see it&#39;s there very</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.679" end="01:26:15.280" style="s2">powerfully um and yet</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.159" end="01:26:18.400" style="s2">if you place the same um the same face</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.280" end="01:26:20.000" style="s2">beside a um a picture of</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.400" end="01:26:21.760" style="s2">a bowl of soup which doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.000" end="01:26:24.000" style="s2">particularly appetizing soup</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.760" end="01:26:25.600" style="s2">but mysteriously um he starts to look</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.000" end="01:26:26.239" style="s2">hungry and he looks like he wants to eat</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.600" end="01:26:28.480" style="s2">the soup</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.239" end="01:26:30.800" style="s2">and if you put and then the final one is</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.480" end="01:26:33.199" style="s2">he&#39;s got an attractive woman lying and</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.800" end="01:26:34.960" style="s2">she&#39;s long and you think ah he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.199" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">to see his lust to his eyes you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.960" end="01:26:38.159" style="s2">he&#39;s hiding it well it&#39;s quite subtle so</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.840" end="01:26:39.679" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.159" end="01:26:41.840" style="s2">sense that we&#39;re able to project and do</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.679" end="01:26:44.800" style="s2">project um a different</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.840" end="01:26:46.000" style="s2">emotion into a into a face is i think</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.800" end="01:26:48.400" style="s2">very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.000" end="01:26:49.280" style="s2">now the thing is that i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.400" end="01:26:50.960" style="s2">very good</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.280" end="01:26:53.280" style="s2">indication of what&#39;s going on when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.960" end="01:26:56.239" style="s2">interpreting our own body state</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.280" end="01:26:57.679" style="s2">so instead of looking at even music in</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.239" end="01:26:59.840" style="s2">face i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.679" end="01:27:01.920" style="s2">of course in my daily life i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.840" end="01:27:04.639" style="s2">interpret my own physiology</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.920" end="01:27:05.520" style="s2">so i&#39;ve got very simple model of my own</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.639" end="01:27:06.800" style="s2">physiology for</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:09.120" style="s2">i know roughly how much adrenaline&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.800" end="01:27:09.760" style="s2">floating around um i know whether i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.120" end="01:27:11.520" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.760" end="01:27:13.120" style="s2">positively attracted to a stimulus or</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.520" end="01:27:14.800" style="s2">wanting to recoil from it</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.120" end="01:27:16.560" style="s2">but there&#39;s not actually a lot more than</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.800" end="01:27:16.880" style="s2">that um it&#39;s not that&#39;s not it but</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.560" end="01:27:18.560" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.880" end="01:27:19.840" style="s2">like you know this is adrenaline for</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.560" end="01:27:20.800" style="s2">example correlate with my breathing</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.840" end="01:27:22.880" style="s2">heart rate and so on</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.800" end="01:27:24.400" style="s2">they&#39;re very really a very simple</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.880" end="01:27:26.880" style="s2">underlying</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.400" end="01:27:28.080" style="s2">physiological system that i&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.880" end="01:27:31.120" style="s2">um so that</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.080" end="01:27:33.440" style="s2">means that if i have a particular</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.120" end="01:27:34.239" style="s2">physiological reaction i have to think</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.440" end="01:27:35.760" style="s2">to myself well</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.239" end="01:27:37.840" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here now what&#39;s why is</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.760" end="01:27:39.600" style="s2">this reaction coming from rather like do</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.840" end="01:27:41.440" style="s2">i like looking at even even as a kid&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.600" end="01:27:44.639" style="s2">rather impassive face</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.440" end="01:27:46.159" style="s2">and work it out as with um with the face</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.639" end="01:27:49.360" style="s2">i look at the context</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.159" end="01:27:50.880" style="s2">so i find myself in a situation where</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.360" end="01:27:52.880" style="s2">well let me take let me give a famous</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.880" end="01:27:54.560" style="s2">example of a bridge crossing experiment</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.880" end="01:27:55.199" style="s2">which is a lovely experiment yeah i love</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.560" end="01:27:56.880" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.199" end="01:27:58.239" style="s2">that was like a hammer hitting me in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.880" end="01:27:59.679" style="s2">head when i read that</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.239" end="01:28:00.639" style="s2">yeah yeah so this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.679" end="01:28:02.159" style="s2">wonderful experiment done in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.639" end="01:28:03.760" style="s2">university of british columbia in about</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.159" end="01:28:05.280" style="s2">1974 i think</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.760" end="01:28:07.600" style="s2">by a couple of a pair of brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.280" end="01:28:10.239" style="s2">social psychologists so they</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.600" end="01:28:11.040" style="s2">they station attractive women who are</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.239" end="01:28:12.880" style="s2">experimenters</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.040" end="01:28:14.320" style="s2">who are holding a clipboard at one end</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.880" end="01:28:16.639" style="s2">of two bridges</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.320" end="01:28:17.520" style="s2">and one bridge is a wobbly bridge um</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.639" end="01:28:18.800" style="s2">which is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.520" end="01:28:20.560" style="s2">suspension bridge which is actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.800" end="01:28:22.639" style="s2">quite a scary bridge to walk across</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.560" end="01:28:25.199" style="s2">sort of moves around as you walk i think</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.639" end="01:28:27.360" style="s2">um and another bridge is just some</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.199" end="01:28:28.719" style="s2">regular bridge down down as a word</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.360" end="01:28:30.560" style="s2">ground level this is an</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.719" end="01:28:32.480" style="s2">area where lots of uh undergraduates</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.560" end="01:28:35.280" style="s2">walk through that picking off</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.480" end="01:28:35.679" style="s2">um male undergraduates and giving them</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.280" end="01:28:38.000" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.679" end="01:28:38.880" style="s2">questions and they say at the end oh by</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.000" end="01:28:40.480" style="s2">the way for</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.880" end="01:28:41.679" style="s2">ethical reasons i have to give you a</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.480" end="01:28:42.639" style="s2">chance to follow up through any</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.679" end="01:28:44.719" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.639" end="01:28:45.760" style="s2">so here&#39;s my phone number and there</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.719" end="01:28:46.719" style="s2">really aren&#39;t any questions that would</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.760" end="01:28:49.520" style="s2">have arisen um</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.719" end="01:28:50.000" style="s2">in this uh change but the phone number&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.520" end="01:28:53.280" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.000" end="01:28:54.719" style="s2">and of course the bridge crosser might</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.280" end="01:28:55.440" style="s2">think oh well i was a very attractive</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.719" end="01:28:57.120" style="s2">woman um</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.440" end="01:28:59.679" style="s2">shall i give her a call just you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.120" end="01:29:02.000" style="s2">just to to get to know her better</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.679" end="01:29:02.800" style="s2">and so and indeed sure enough uh well</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.000" end="01:29:03.600" style="s2">there are two things that are</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.800" end="01:29:05.600" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.600" end="01:29:08.000" style="s2">that they measured one is how many of</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.600" end="01:29:10.000" style="s2">the bridge crosses ask for the number</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.000" end="01:29:11.360" style="s2">and how many don&#39;t and then how many of</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:12.880" style="s2">those that did ask remember how many did</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.360" end="01:29:15.520" style="s2">they actually actually call</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.880" end="01:29:17.679" style="s2">now it turns out that you get something</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.520" end="01:29:20.080" style="s2">like 50 or so percent more</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.679" end="01:29:21.360" style="s2">of asking for the number and calling for</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.080" end="01:29:22.159" style="s2">people who&#39;ve walked across the high</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.360" end="01:29:23.520" style="s2">bridge</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.159" end="01:29:26.080" style="s2">now what&#39;s going on there you might</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.520" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">think this how can that be relevant</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.080" end="01:29:29.840" style="s2">but it is relevant of course from the</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.080" end="01:29:30.719" style="s2">perspective of trying to understand your</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.840" end="01:29:33.760" style="s2">own feelings</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.719" end="01:29:35.280" style="s2">uh through your monitoring of physiology</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.760" end="01:29:37.040" style="s2">because what happens to those people on</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.280" end="01:29:38.800" style="s2">the high bridge they walk across the</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.040" end="01:29:40.639" style="s2">high bridge it&#39;s quite scary</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.800" end="01:29:42.239" style="s2">so that leads to all kinds of adrenaline</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.639" end="01:29:45.040" style="s2">flooding around the system</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.239" end="01:29:45.440" style="s2">then they meet the experimenter and they</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.040" end="01:29:47.600" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.440" end="01:29:49.120" style="s2">well i just need to have this incredible</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.600" end="01:29:51.120" style="s2">adrenaline rush</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.120" end="01:29:52.800" style="s2">wow i mean the only reason it must be</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.120" end="01:29:54.400" style="s2">because this person is just somehow</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.800" end="01:29:56.080" style="s2">connecting with me in some fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.400" end="01:29:58.239" style="s2">way um i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.080" end="01:29:59.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll get her number and call um of</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.239" end="01:30:01.679" style="s2">course in practice</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.440" end="01:30:02.800" style="s2">the adrenaline rush is is the bridge but</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.679" end="01:30:04.239" style="s2">we&#39;re not seeing it that way because</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.800" end="01:30:05.440" style="s2">we&#39;re locked into the conversation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.239" end="01:30:07.199" style="s2">having now and</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.440" end="01:30:09.120" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s you know that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.199" end="01:30:12.159" style="s2">interpretation of our</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.120" end="01:30:13.199" style="s2">um experience is a tremendous feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.159" end="01:30:15.760" style="s2">interest and attraction</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.199" end="01:30:17.440" style="s2">in this person and that that phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.760" end="01:30:18.880" style="s2">i think is is very very general so</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.440" end="01:30:20.560" style="s2">another example much more prosaic</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.880" end="01:30:21.920" style="s2">example but rather clever</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.560" end="01:30:24.639" style="s2">there&#39;s some experiments by danny</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.920" end="01:30:25.520" style="s2">oppenheimer um psychologist now carnegie</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.639" end="01:30:27.040" style="s2">mellon</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.520" end="01:30:28.719" style="s2">he&#39;s done many many clever experiments</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.040" end="01:30:29.679" style="s2">in this kind of thing but one very</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.719" end="01:30:31.199" style="s2">simple one</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.679" end="01:30:32.719" style="s2">is that you give people pictures of</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.199" end="01:30:33.920" style="s2">luxury cars</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.719" end="01:30:35.840" style="s2">which are either bad you&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.920" end="01:30:37.920" style="s2">photocopied um so</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.840" end="01:30:39.120" style="s2">so the first thing is if you ask people</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.920" end="01:30:40.800" style="s2">which car they prefer</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.120" end="01:30:42.239" style="s2">they tend to prefer the well photocopied</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.800" end="01:30:44.320" style="s2">car and you&#39;re not asking about the</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.239" end="01:30:47.040" style="s2">picture they&#39;re asking about the car</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.320" end="01:30:47.920" style="s2">but if they see a crumbly photographed</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.040" end="01:30:49.760" style="s2">luxury card</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.920" end="01:30:52.080" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know i just don&#39;t do like</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.760" end="01:30:54.080" style="s2">that so much now ef on the other hand so</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.080" end="01:30:56.159" style="s2">the same thing so i&#39;m looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.080" end="01:30:58.400" style="s2">the image and i&#39;m thinking i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.159" end="01:31:00.960" style="s2">generally feeling a slightly icky queasy</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.400" end="01:31:02.000" style="s2">just unsettled feeling about that image</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.960" end="01:31:03.920" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with that</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.000" end="01:31:05.440" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with the image of course</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.920" end="01:31:06.800" style="s2">the answer is well it&#39;s badly</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.440" end="01:31:08.000" style="s2">photocopied that&#39;s wrong with it what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.800" end="01:31:09.840" style="s2">wrong with it but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.000" end="01:31:11.199" style="s2">interpret it that way we just think well</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.840" end="01:31:14.000" style="s2">i&#39;m looking at a car and</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.199" end="01:31:15.199" style="s2">i&#39;m feeling visually a bit unhappy</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.000" end="01:31:17.520" style="s2">probably it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.199" end="01:31:18.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a car i don&#39;t really like the</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.520" end="01:31:20.480" style="s2">wonderful thing about danny&#39;s experiment</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.800" end="01:31:23.679" style="s2">is he has an extra condition where</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.480" end="01:31:24.639" style="s2">he tells he tells people i&#39;m so sorry</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.679" end="01:31:26.159" style="s2">we had real problems with the</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.639" end="01:31:26.880" style="s2">photocopier so some of these images are</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.159" end="01:31:28.719" style="s2">terrible</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.880" end="01:31:30.960" style="s2">and then the effects doesn&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.719" end="01:31:33.360" style="s2">go away i think but it largely goes away</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.960" end="01:31:34.400" style="s2">do you do as soon as people know oh</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.360" end="01:31:36.239" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.400" end="01:31:37.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a beautiful car but a crummy</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.239" end="01:31:38.639" style="s2">photograph close to coffee then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.840" end="01:31:40.159" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.639" end="01:31:42.239" style="s2">so similarly i think in the bridge</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.159" end="01:31:44.400" style="s2">crafting experiment had the</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.239" end="01:31:45.600" style="s2">experimenter reminded people oh you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.400" end="01:31:46.960" style="s2">just walked across the bridge how much</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.600" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">adrenaline do you feel maybe that if</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.960" end="01:31:50.000" style="s2">that would have been the question</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:51.760" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the been the effect of</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:53.600" style="s2">walking across that bridge bridge on</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.760" end="01:31:55.199" style="s2">on how you feel then they&#39;d have thought</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.600" end="01:31:56.719" style="s2">oh yeah right of course the adrenaline&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.199" end="01:31:59.360" style="s2">coming from the bridge not from</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.719" end="01:32:00.159" style="s2">the experimenter and so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.360" end="01:32:02.480" style="s2">clue that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.159" end="01:32:03.840" style="s2">it&#39;s interpretative the sense of emotion</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.480" end="01:32:05.120" style="s2">a sense of attraction to a person</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.840" end="01:32:07.280" style="s2">attraction to a car</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.120" end="01:32:08.560" style="s2">sense of fear of walking across a bridge</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.280" end="01:32:10.480" style="s2">and whatever it may be these are</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.560" end="01:32:12.719" style="s2">interpretative states you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.480" end="01:32:14.239" style="s2">trying to work out what your body is</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.719" end="01:32:15.840" style="s2">telling you in just the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.239" end="01:32:17.920" style="s2">looking at an ambiguous face</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.840" end="01:32:19.280" style="s2">you&#39;ll try to work out what that face is</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.920" end="01:32:21.760" style="s2">is meaning</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.280" end="01:32:22.800" style="s2">and you to do that you&#39;re taking account</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.760" end="01:32:24.880" style="s2">of the context</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.800" end="01:32:26.560" style="s2">as well as your body but you&#39;re not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.880" end="01:32:27.199" style="s2">not the case that the emotion is in any</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.560" end="01:32:29.120" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.199" end="01:32:30.800" style="s2">welling up from within fully interpreted</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.120" end="01:32:31.280" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t come from within</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.800" end="01:32:33.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.280" end="01:32:34.320" style="s2">with its uh wearing it&#39;s a concert on</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.280" end="01:32:35.679" style="s2">its face as it were</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.320" end="01:32:37.840" style="s2">rather than you&#39;ve got physiological</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.679" end="01:32:40.159" style="s2">response contextual situation</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.840" end="01:32:40.960" style="s2">and the interpretative brain is churning</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.159" end="01:32:43.120" style="s2">away and thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.960" end="01:32:44.080" style="s2">i know what this is it must be this um</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.120" end="01:32:46.320" style="s2">but often of course</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.080" end="01:32:48.880" style="s2">those interpretations are wrong that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.320" end="01:32:50.480" style="s2">really a powerful insight i must say</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.880" end="01:32:52.560" style="s2">and you give a very interesting example</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.480" end="01:32:54.560" style="s2">of the potential dangers of thinking the</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.560" end="01:32:55.120" style="s2">opposite you tell the story of bertrand</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.560" end="01:32:57.600" style="s2">russell</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.120" end="01:32:58.480" style="s2">and you know his internalized view that</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.600" end="01:33:00.639" style="s2">he no longer</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.480" end="01:33:02.080" style="s2">loved his wife talk about that a little</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.639" end="01:33:04.960" style="s2">bit and some of the dangers</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.080" end="01:33:05.520" style="s2">of assuming that these emotional states</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.960" end="01:33:08.159" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.520" end="01:33:08.800" style="s2">deeper than they actually are i think</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.159" end="01:33:10.000" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.800" end="01:33:11.520" style="s2">something we all have to be really</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.000" end="01:33:13.520" style="s2">careful of yeah so bertrand russell is</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.520" end="01:33:16.080" style="s2">cycling i think near grand chester</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.520" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">and he has a some thunderbolt sense that</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.080" end="01:33:18.719" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t love his wife</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:20.639" style="s2">and although in fact no marriage then</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.719" end="01:33:22.800" style="s2">continues on for many years</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.639" end="01:33:24.560" style="s2">i think um it&#39;s at that point sort of</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.800" end="01:33:28.320" style="s2">all over and it&#39;s just a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.560" end="01:33:31.600" style="s2">um escape uh and and</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.320" end="01:33:33.760" style="s2">gradual extrication um and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.600" end="01:33:35.360" style="s2">his mental model and fox virgin russia</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.760" end="01:33:37.520" style="s2">was a phenomenal genius</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.360" end="01:33:38.719" style="s2">so not not through lack of sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.520" end="01:33:40.880" style="s2">sophisticated thinking</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.719" end="01:33:42.000" style="s2">this mental model of what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.880" end="01:33:43.840" style="s2">emotions is</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.000" end="01:33:45.360" style="s2">from time to time your true feelings</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.840" end="01:33:46.560" style="s2">just burst forth and when they burst</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.360" end="01:33:48.320" style="s2">forth you&#39;ve just got to know that</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.560" end="01:33:49.199" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my real feeling there it</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.320" end="01:33:51.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.199" end="01:33:53.199" style="s2">you know i just got to act on that um</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.040" end="01:33:54.159" style="s2">but she did um now that maybe it may</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.199" end="01:33:56.000" style="s2">or may not have been the right thing to</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.159" end="01:33:57.520" style="s2">do but i think not for that reason</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.000" end="01:33:58.080" style="s2">because i think this sense that we have</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.520" end="01:34:00.239" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.080" end="01:34:01.520" style="s2">of deep things welling up deep thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.239" end="01:34:04.320" style="s2">welling up from within is just</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.520" end="01:34:06.400" style="s2">fundamentally fundamentally extremely</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.320" end="01:34:07.760" style="s2">forced and illusory and a similar</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.400" end="01:34:10.159" style="s2">thought is that um</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.760" end="01:34:11.679" style="s2">in in heating discussions with our loved</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.159" end="01:34:12.719" style="s2">ones we can quite often find people</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.679" end="01:34:14.400" style="s2">saying things</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.719" end="01:34:15.840" style="s2">that one has that feeling of well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.400" end="01:34:17.679" style="s2">what you really think there now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.840" end="01:34:18.880" style="s2">the truth has come out at last</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.679" end="01:34:20.480" style="s2">and i think again that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.880" end="01:34:21.840" style="s2">dangerous perspective to have we should</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.480" end="01:34:24.480" style="s2">view ourselves much more as</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.840" end="01:34:25.520" style="s2">creative fiction spinners who can</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.480" end="01:34:27.520" style="s2">produce a fiction</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.520" end="01:34:29.280" style="s2">of one type and of the reverse type and</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.520" end="01:34:30.719" style="s2">not and neither the listener nor the</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.280" end="01:34:32.960" style="s2">person creating the fiction is really</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.719" end="01:34:33.760" style="s2">should be really sure quite what story</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.960" end="01:34:35.280" style="s2">is the right one</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.760" end="01:34:36.560" style="s2">so that sort of sense that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.280" end="01:34:37.600" style="s2">kind of rubicon you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.560" end="01:34:39.840" style="s2">accidentally pass</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.600" end="01:34:40.880" style="s2">or that some sort of true insight which</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.840" end="01:34:42.159" style="s2">will come to you and</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.880" end="01:34:43.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no way back i think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.159" end="01:34:45.199" style="s2">dangerous one we should be very wary of</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.920" end="01:34:46.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.199" end="01:34:48.480" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s really good advice</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.880" end="01:34:50.159" style="s2">the theme throughout the book is that</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.480" end="01:34:52.239" style="s2">what&#39;s really in our brain is both</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.159" end="01:34:53.760" style="s2">sparse and inconsistent so</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.239" end="01:34:55.600" style="s2">don&#39;t take it as seriously as we</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.760" end="01:34:57.280" style="s2">sometimes do right</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.600" end="01:34:59.679" style="s2">because it&#39;s provisional the brain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.280" end="01:35:02.000" style="s2">just making this [ __ ] up on the fly the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.679" end="01:35:03.280" style="s2">confabulator i&#39;ve used that term for a</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.000" end="01:35:04.560" style="s2">long time since i became aware of</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.280" end="01:35:06.080" style="s2">gazanika&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.560" end="01:35:07.520" style="s2">i wish we could go into gazanica but</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.080" end="01:35:08.880" style="s2">we&#39;re short on time let&#39;s move on to</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.520" end="01:35:11.360" style="s2">some applied stuff</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.880" end="01:35:13.280" style="s2">now with all this idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.360" end="01:35:14.000" style="s2">provisional it&#39;s confabulation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.280" end="01:35:17.360" style="s2">sparse it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.000" end="01:35:17.760" style="s2">inconsistent nonetheless we have built</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.360" end="01:35:21.119" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.760" end="01:35:22.880" style="s2">culture right and culture takes</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.119" end="01:35:25.679" style="s2">all this isn&#39;t consistency and</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.880" end="01:35:28.320" style="s2">sparseness and sort of gets co-created</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.679" end="01:35:29.280" style="s2">with some attempts to put stakes in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.320" end="01:35:30.480" style="s2">ground</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.280" end="01:35:32.719" style="s2">and you know i was thinking of some</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.480" end="01:35:35.360" style="s2">extreme examples one of which</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.719" end="01:35:36.960" style="s2">is the catholic catechism as a kid i was</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.360" end="01:35:38.880" style="s2">raised a catholic until i rebelled</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.960" end="01:35:41.040" style="s2">against it at age 11. i&#39;ve told the</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.880" end="01:35:42.800" style="s2">story on the podcast a few times</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.040" end="01:35:44.880" style="s2">but it was pretty powerful system of</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.800" end="01:35:46.400" style="s2">indoctrination right so you just repeat</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.880" end="01:35:47.920" style="s2">it again and again and again you write</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.400" end="01:35:50.960" style="s2">down memory traces and</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.920" end="01:35:52.960" style="s2">you can spit out the answers to the 300</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.960" end="01:35:54.639" style="s2">questions in the baltimore catechism by</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.960" end="01:35:56.320" style="s2">the time you&#39;re nine years old</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.639" end="01:35:58.960" style="s2">and then you look at you know marxist</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.320" end="01:36:00.560" style="s2">leninism and their worship of the works</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.960" end="01:36:03.119" style="s2">of marx and angles you know a good</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.560" end="01:36:05.280" style="s2">marxist leninist could cough up marx</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.119" end="01:36:06.159" style="s2">or angles justification for almost</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.280" end="01:36:08.719" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.159" end="01:36:10.080" style="s2">and then of course the similar systems</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.719" end="01:36:12.639" style="s2">in other religions</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.080" end="01:36:14.400" style="s2">whether it&#39;s hindu buddhism taoist and</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.639" end="01:36:16.719" style="s2">cultures more generally</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.400" end="01:36:18.480" style="s2">select certain representations for</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.719" end="01:36:20.960" style="s2">maximum repetition</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.480" end="01:36:22.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s what culture seems to be yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.960" end="01:36:23.520" style="s2">i think that&#39;s absolutely right no i</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.400" end="01:36:24.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s something deeply true about</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.520" end="01:36:25.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.000" end="01:36:27.119" style="s2">um and i think to extend we should think</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.920" end="01:36:30.560" style="s2">of ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.119" end="01:36:33.600" style="s2">as as as traditions so each each</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.560" end="01:36:34.880" style="s2">each of us is a is a tradition of which</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.600" end="01:36:36.840" style="s2">basically consisting of all our past</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.880" end="01:36:40.480" style="s2">thoughts of actions so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.840" end="01:36:42.480" style="s2">incredible degree to which um we have we</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.480" end="01:36:44.400" style="s2">because of our flow of experience and</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.480" end="01:36:45.040" style="s2">our continual flow of attention hopping</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.400" end="01:36:46.480" style="s2">from one</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.040" end="01:36:48.000" style="s2">one thing to another we built up this</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.480" end="01:36:49.199" style="s2">enormous repertoire of experience and</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.000" end="01:36:51.360" style="s2">that will condition the way we</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.199" end="01:36:53.360" style="s2">think about new things so we just want</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.360" end="01:36:55.040" style="s2">to stress</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.360" end="01:36:56.400" style="s2">that that we are incredibly rich</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.040" end="01:36:56.960" style="s2">sophisticated beings and we reach</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.400" end="01:36:58.800" style="s2">through our</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.960" end="01:37:00.159" style="s2">ability to tap into our own history and</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.800" end="01:37:01.760" style="s2">our own tradition but of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.159" end="01:37:03.760" style="s2">not just our own tradition</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.760" end="01:37:05.600" style="s2">actually many of the things we know come</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.760" end="01:37:06.800" style="s2">from other people in fact we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.600" end="01:37:08.639" style="s2">collecting</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.800" end="01:37:09.920" style="s2">we collectively create cultural</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.639" end="01:37:11.760" style="s2">traditions which are far more</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.920" end="01:37:13.920" style="s2">elaborate than any individual could</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.760" end="01:37:16.880" style="s2">create but that does also</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.920" end="01:37:18.320" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s possible to try to coerce</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.880" end="01:37:18.960" style="s2">or corral people in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.320" end="01:37:20.880" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.960" end="01:37:22.400" style="s2">by by putting various sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.880" end="01:37:24.960" style="s2">stakes in the ground and saying</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.400" end="01:37:25.600" style="s2">whenever um whatever you think about any</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.960" end="01:37:28.239" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.600" end="01:37:28.960" style="s2">this is one thing we all take to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.239" end="01:37:31.679" style="s2">jubitable</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.960" end="01:37:32.960" style="s2">and to have as a list of sort of basic</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.679" end="01:37:34.719" style="s2">basic truths</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.960" end="01:37:36.080" style="s2">and even though those truths may be very</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.719" end="01:37:38.400" style="s2">hard to understand so</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.080" end="01:37:39.679" style="s2">you may have people who are uh convinced</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.400" end="01:37:41.199" style="s2">of some religious truth</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.679" end="01:37:42.960" style="s2">so for example the trinity beings are</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.199" end="01:37:43.520" style="s2">three in one which is very hard to know</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.960" end="01:37:44.960" style="s2">what that</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.520" end="01:37:46.560" style="s2">really what it is exactly one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.960" end="01:37:48.239" style="s2">believing but one can think well</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.560" end="01:37:49.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve been taught this is right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.239" end="01:37:51.280" style="s2">important and i believe it well possibly</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.840" end="01:37:52.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve been taught it&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.280" end="01:37:55.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s very important so i definitely</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.800" end="01:37:56.400" style="s2">don&#39;t believe it but whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.040" end="01:37:58.239" style="s2">whichever way around it is</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.400" end="01:37:59.600" style="s2">one can have an extremely strong sense</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.239" end="01:38:01.119" style="s2">of this is an important conviction to</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.600" end="01:38:02.719" style="s2">hold on to and defend</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.119" end="01:38:04.639" style="s2">even without a really clear sense of</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.719" end="01:38:05.760" style="s2">what it is that one is holding on to and</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.639" end="01:38:06.800" style="s2">defending</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.760" end="01:38:09.119" style="s2">and so i think we should we should</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.800" end="01:38:12.239" style="s2">always be skeptical of stakes in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.119" end="01:38:13.360" style="s2">ground if all states should be movable</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.239" end="01:38:14.719" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.360" end="01:38:16.400" style="s2">that comes out of that work very</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.719" end="01:38:17.199" style="s2">strongly and i hope disseminates out</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.400" end="01:38:19.440" style="s2">into the world</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.199" end="01:38:21.760" style="s2">is that all this stuff is provisional</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.440" end="01:38:24.239" style="s2">it&#39;s inconsistent it&#39;s sketchy</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.760" end="01:38:26.080" style="s2">and so don&#39;t believe that [ __ ] right</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.239" end="01:38:27.920" style="s2">unless you can find objective evidence</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.080" end="01:38:29.119" style="s2">that reinforces it you know and it</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.920" end="01:38:31.360" style="s2">points to me</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.119" end="01:38:32.320" style="s2">even more the importance of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.360" end="01:38:34.239" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.320" end="01:38:36.239" style="s2">frame of mind and i&#39;m sure i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.239" end="01:38:37.280" style="s2">piss off some of my post-modernist</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.239" end="01:38:40.639" style="s2">friends here</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.280" end="01:38:41.679" style="s2">you know the liberal universalist mind</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.639" end="01:38:43.520" style="s2">right that</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.679" end="01:38:46.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t try to go from theory to</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.520" end="01:38:49.280" style="s2">everything and believes in tolerance</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.239" end="01:38:51.440" style="s2">and empiricism essentially as ways to</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.280" end="01:38:53.760" style="s2">engage with the world that we should be</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.440" end="01:38:56.159" style="s2">suspicious of these stakes in the ground</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.760" end="01:38:57.920" style="s2">this has been a wonderful conversation i</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.159" end="01:38:58.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to all my notes by any sets</p>

<p begin="01:39:13.119" end="01:39:17.520" style="s2">i hope it helps all of us just think a</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.239" end="01:39:19.920" style="s2">little bit more about</p>

<p begin="01:39:19.920" end="01:39:22.560" style="s2">know how we work</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.800" end="01:39:24.159" style="s2">and also the fact that we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.560" end="01:39:26.320" style="s2">too sure about</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.159" end="01:39:29.119" style="s2">both any of our beliefs but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.320" end="01:39:30.960" style="s2">not any of our beliefs about our minds</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.119" end="01:39:32.400" style="s2">indeed well this has been wonderful i&#39;ve</p>
