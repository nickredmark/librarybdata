<p begin="00:00:00.320" end="00:00:06.120" style="s2">a cardinal error is to try to expand a</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:09.440" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:10.559" style="s2">linearly like at the same level language</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.440" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.559" end="00:00:13.840" style="s2">so a cardinal error is to say we need</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">everybody to speak</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.840" end="00:00:16.960" style="s2">english or chinese right you pick pick a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:18.640" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.960" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">and so of course as it happens you end</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.640" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">up with an imperial mode right</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:26.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a your mind has to be operating</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">this particular culture this language</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.800" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">um and now we&#39;re competing for minds and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">maybe you might speak three languages</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:32.239" style="s2">but the end of the day this would be</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:34.480" style="s2">like a finite uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.239" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a rivalrous game for mine right in</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.480" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">culture space</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">if you run it at the meta protocol what</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:42.320" style="s2">happens is is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:43.760" style="s2">as long as there&#39;s a way for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.320" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">establish</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">in languages is there translatability</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:49.360" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">can occur and that communication can</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.360" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">occur within certain boundary conditions</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">i.e that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not so expensive that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:56.840" style="s2">really communication right the entropy</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">is low enough</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.840" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">then um you you actually you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">you you get around the rivalries dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">that&#39;s like okay great you can have an</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:08.560" style="s2">arbitrarily large number of cultures</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">everybody can kind of and if i want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">create my own i can create my own</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">as long as it&#39;s compatible with the meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">protocol i got a lot of room to maneuver</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">um and and the meta protocols which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:21.520" style="s2">funny about is the meta protocol</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">is almost geometric what i mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.520" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re always going to want to design</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">your your culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">using the meta protocol because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">just the best way to design a culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">right if you design a culture outside of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">the boundary the meta protocol it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:38.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.960" end="00:01:38.000" style="s2">uh how do i say this</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.560" end="00:01:41.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like trying to say okay i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.680" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">to design a body but i&#39;m going to design</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.200" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">a body that can&#39;t digest or that dies</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">within three days you&#39;re like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:47.439" style="s2">kind of a shitty body you could do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">what&#39;s the point of that like no no</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.439" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">here&#39;s a series of basic rules that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">a body work and you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">your body can be six foot four it could</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">be five foot eight you know your skin</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">color can vary in these directions you</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">know your eyes like there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">bunch of variation on the morphology</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">of phylogenetics um but</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">uh and by the way there&#39;s actually wide</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">varies but a body without a heart is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">kind of a non-starter like that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of like that like the meta</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">protocols for any violet for any viable</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">culture that plugs into this</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">environment um is like a body and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">you&#39;ve got lots of variations and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">the there&#39;s now no competition because</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">you&#39;re really just looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">cool explorations of what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">possibility space is inside</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">the meta protocol which would</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">potentially be enormous like much larger</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">than our current space basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">cultures but they&#39;re all viable</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">and part of viability is they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">interoperable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">yeah and they can all interconnect um</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">potentially speak that same language</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">right on a completely different new</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">ideally which doesn&#39;t lead to all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">issues that we face um that could</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">potentially blow</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">us all up right with the technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">coming up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s really interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">just i just had some insights on</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">how to articulate that clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">um okay so please continue yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s like sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">i think the constraints are um</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">if you use the metaphor of speciation at</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">the body level</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.560" style="s2">there&#39;s some value there the point of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">speciate or the way we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.560" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">have come to define speciation is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">precisely</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">lack of compatibility at the genotype</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">and so if i have two phenotypes that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">they may be bizarrely compatible like</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">they can actually mate</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">in terms of of uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">physicality but they&#39;re not compatible</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">at the genetic level then i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">actually i have</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">now two species and what happens of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">course is that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">they stop mating and they begin to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">species differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">exactly um and so the so so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">some of the better questions are like</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">whoa okay what are the what are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">and we&#39;re finding we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">in terms of uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">uh peter lindberg&#39;s you know cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">war 2.0 right</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">um when two</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">cultures are in a circumstance where the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">only way they can be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">is in fact violence exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">then they&#39;re they&#39;re effectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">engaging in a speciation they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">they&#39;re mutually incompatible and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">they&#39;re engaged in per se rivalrous</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">um so it&#39;s interesting to say okay the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">meta protocol effectively is the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">of that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s a mechanism what are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">characteristics that your</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">culture must maintain at all times to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">ensure</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s always a non-violent way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">being in relationship with any other</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">uh culture sorry so please continue well</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">sorry what i got from there is you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">how you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">the level of change needs to be on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">we create a new dna rna</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">thing that now opens up that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">hearing right like</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">the meta protocol ends up being we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">to figure out what that dna</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">that allows for all these potential new</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">cultures to come arise</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">that are on a different operating system</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">than what we currently</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">have yeah and what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">i had this insight yesterday actually it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">there will be a lot of resonance with</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">in some sense like the highest tone of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">almost all existing cultures</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">yeah if you use the metaphor of um like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">the emergence of the of the neuron of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">neurology</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">like okay there&#39;s a like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">proto-neuron like the the proto-retinol</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">the proto-photosensitive cell</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a a movement where</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a cell that has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">sensitivity to photon um</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s kind of haphazard it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not useful enough to really build</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">stuff you can&#39;t build eyeballs with it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">right it&#39;s just not high fidelity enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not consistent enough it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">repeatable enough but</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">if you kind of look at the there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">a a vector</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">that is pointing towards this this place</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">this location is like okay now that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">is the thing right and if i see the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">the tree like the series of of uh you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">know evolutionary stages i can i can</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">actually see where they are on the arrow</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">and the ones that are closest to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">final to the to the actual point</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">like oh i&#39;ve got now got a a a retinal</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">cell like a photocell</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">or a photosensitive cell like the ones</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">that are just prior to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">this i&#39;m anthropomorphizing the ones</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">that are just prior to that i&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.050" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s what i was trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.050" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">and even though they may all be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">variations the commonality is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">they&#39;re all going to point at that right</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">the highest tone the highest yearning</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">the thing that has been the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">noble or valorous aspect of many many</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">different cultures</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">is the point i guess that&#39;s the vector</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">we can kind of suss out that vector</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">and say oh okay that&#39;s the noble the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:16.720" style="s2">noble the noble thing that&#39;s been trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">to arise</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.720" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">in culture we&#39;ve now we can now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">point at it and now</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">many many different cultures will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">able to look at this new thing and say</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">yeah cool that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">reified the good part in like an</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">alchemical essence we captured</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">the part that we&#39;ve been trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">to the essence just</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">trying to express itself and have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">able to to get rid of the stuff that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">you know legacy that needs to go away</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">the michelangelo move yeah the</p>
