<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:28.810" style="s2">is that the people who are don&#39;t believe</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.500" end="00:03:42.700" style="s2">this is a long wrong language long wrong</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.329" end="00:04:09.579" style="s2">conservative individuals who don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.109" end="00:04:11.980" style="s2">to see the progress of scientific and</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.009" end="00:04:50.490" style="s2">come up with very novel and elegant</p>
