<p begin="00:00:03.720" end="00:00:08.010" style="s2">you know students they&#39;re one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.850" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">suggestions and has been learned before</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.010" end="00:00:13.620" style="s2">you starting at Ralph&#39;s to put any water</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:15.870" style="s2">in this dams you maybe need 40 50 60</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.620" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">millimetres of fairly constant later</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.870" end="00:00:23.640" style="s2">drained well if you would look at much</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">more but it falls on your roof will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">living and you have tanks and can tanks</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">come in all shapes these days you could</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">actually accept the considerable</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">percentage of responsibility right there</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.969" style="s2">you use it and I think that will become</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming very popular in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.969" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">we used to be dependent on Draenor the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">tanks not there many years ago they were</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">banned in some suburban areas for quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">some years and today local government</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.809" end="00:00:59.690" style="s2">gives bonuses or subsidies for people to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:01:05.630" style="s2">establish the tanks again so I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.690" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a problem in people&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.630" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">rather than a real problem there is less</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">rain pert climbs have about a reduction</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">of about 20 percent rainfall in the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">20 25 years and that&#39;s true for other</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">areas as well but is enough definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">enough for the needs of urban areas or</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:34.220" style="s2">suburban areas agriculture will have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">change in I grow food I&#39;m a fireman and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.220" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">no sort of to overhead irrigation</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">systems which you see have a a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">small place these days or flood</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">irrigation it&#39;s probably something which</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">we should see on photo is not in reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">anymore the irrigation system today</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">which can fulfill the need of irrigation</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">pipe unsatisfactory but without the need</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">for the same amount of water which other</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">irrigation systems need and some crops</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">in the case of Australia we should not</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:10.780" style="s2">grow any more I mean I still do grow</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:14.050" style="s2">rice so cotton same survey</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.780" end="00:02:16.420" style="s2">crazy and finally you&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.050" end="00:02:19.560" style="s2">involved in some more mainstream design</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.420" end="00:02:22.630" style="s2">projects as a consultant these you see</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.560" end="00:02:24.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a potential of bringing some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:27.220" style="s2">the design lessons from eco-village</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.340" end="00:02:30.940" style="s2">design into the creation of new towns</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.220" end="00:02:34.690" style="s2">and new sub obvious and this is still</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.940" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">going on and do we have a contribution</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.690" end="00:02:43.090" style="s2">to make a memory yeah I&#39;m convinced we</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:45.820" style="s2">have to know the figures which are being</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.090" end="00:02:50.709" style="s2">presented to us now showed that we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:53.380" style="s2">to reduce our energy needs by 80 90 90</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.709" end="00:02:56.170" style="s2">percent of what the current uses in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.380" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">north in the Western world I think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.170" end="00:03:01.900" style="s2">need to look at each aspects of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:04.660" style="s2">lives but that I mean food us through</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.900" end="00:03:06.910" style="s2">this will be the highest energy user to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.660" end="00:03:09.730" style="s2">be shipping it around such long</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:11.590" style="s2">distances I think education is a big</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.730" end="00:03:14.230" style="s2">part to play in suburban urban</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.590" end="00:03:16.989" style="s2">environments and the veinous of what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.230" end="00:03:19.989" style="s2">possible and on small spaces like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.989" end="00:03:22.299" style="s2">mentioned with vegetable growing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.989" end="00:03:26.709" style="s2">energy there are some technical</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.299" end="00:03:29.410" style="s2">solutions but no to replace call five</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.709" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">houses power stations with photovoltaics</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.410" end="00:03:35.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it is really the solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:37.299" style="s2">either we need to reduce our needs and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.380" end="00:03:40.299" style="s2">some of that will include technical</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.299" end="00:03:43.150" style="s2">solutions some of these lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.299" end="00:03:44.950" style="s2">changes rather than just throwing our</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.150" end="00:03:47.320" style="s2">clothes into a dryer which some people</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.950" end="00:03:49.060" style="s2">apparently do there is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.320" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">excellent trial called the Sun which we</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.060" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">could should use and are many in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:56.230" style="s2">examples too but technology will have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:57.970" style="s2">part to play there too in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.230" end="00:04:00.130" style="s2">water collection I mentioned some</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.970" end="00:04:02.890" style="s2">examples and also in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.130" end="00:04:04.810" style="s2">situation of waste water or what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.890" end="00:04:08.140" style="s2">call waste water as we need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.810" end="00:04:10.660" style="s2">paradigm shift as I see human excrement</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.140" end="00:04:14.050" style="s2">of the diesels are rather that problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.660" end="00:04:18.130" style="s2">if they combine this</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.050" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">and using design and technology in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.130" end="00:04:23.140" style="s2">fireplace I reckon our quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:25.330" style="s2">will be higher or have more social</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.140" end="00:04:28.270" style="s2">interactions having will be much higher</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.330" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">much happier then many people are at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.270" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">moment and they can very much reduce our</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:37.780" style="s2">requirements</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.080" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">I think the future can be very bright if</p>
