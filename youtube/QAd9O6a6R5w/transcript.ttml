<p begin="00:02:32.240" end="00:02:36.380" style="s2">existential or just any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.100" end="00:02:39.560" style="s2">catastrophic risk it&#39;s not just a weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.380" end="00:02:41.600" style="s2">fetish topic and it&#39;s not just purely</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.560" end="00:02:45.470" style="s2">there is some risk and we want to</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.350" end="00:03:09.830" style="s2">in the presence of that we&#39;ve always had</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.090" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">a sense that human nature is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.830" end="00:03:15.860" style="s2">thing fix can genetically or at whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:18.110" style="s2">level fix and then we&#39;re looking at good</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.860" end="00:03:19.250" style="s2">behavior you know within that framework</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.110" end="00:03:22.489" style="s2">and as soon as we&#39;re at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.250" end="00:03:23.870" style="s2">genetic engineering humans as a real at</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.489" end="00:03:27.500" style="s2">least thought experiments could be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.870" end="00:03:29.739" style="s2">real possible technology we could work</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.500" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">to genetically engineer all people to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.739" end="00:03:34.970" style="s2">sociopathic hyper computers who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">feel badly about winning at win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.970" end="00:03:39.980" style="s2">games at all and were optimized for it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:42.709" style="s2">we could work to chip our brains into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.980" end="00:03:44.660" style="s2">eyes that could take us even further in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.709" end="00:03:48.170" style="s2">that direction of being able to win</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.660" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">those games we could engineer aggression</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.170" end="00:03:51.530" style="s2">out of ourselves completely and so then</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:54.920" style="s2">we start to say like wow those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.530" end="00:03:58.490" style="s2">really different realities what do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.920" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">want well we want to win the game why do</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.490" end="00:04:02.450" style="s2">we want to win there&#39;s an assumed game</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:04.459" style="s2">that we&#39;re playing against whomever</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.450" end="00:04:05.660" style="s2">right that some ways some in group is</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.299" end="00:04:22.190" style="s2">they have a narrow set of metrics that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.970" end="00:04:25.220" style="s2">define a win and everything outside of</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.710" end="00:08:50.740" style="s2">now people freaked out because if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.089" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">say something other than capitalism they</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.740" end="00:08:53.080" style="s2">think that you mean communism and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:54.550" style="s2">want to take their stuff and have the</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.550" end="00:08:57.730" style="s2">and if you say something of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:08:59.529" style="s2">democracy again it&#39;s assumed that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.730" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">gonna be like some kind of fascists</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.529" end="00:09:02.680" style="s2">terrible thing and something other than</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.680" end="00:09:07.630" style="s2">no I want to be very clear that I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.750" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">been on the table so far so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:23.529" style="s2">democracy you know when Churchill said</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.130" end="00:09:24.910" style="s2">democracy is the single worst form of</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.890" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">terrible but all the other ones are even</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.900" end="00:09:40.510" style="s2">worse because the idea of government or</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">governance is this really tricky thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">where we&#39;re trying to get lots of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:46.420" style="s2">different humans to cooperate or agree</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">or make choices together and like we</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:09.240" style="s2">do is gonna stuff up that I care</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.350" end="00:12:11.070" style="s2">about that bridge that you want to build</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.240" end="00:12:13.199" style="s2">so that you can get across the river</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.070" end="00:12:14.910" style="s2">without driving all the way around is</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.199" end="00:12:18.540" style="s2">gonna kill all the owl&#39;s in this area</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.910" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">and mess up some fisheries and I care</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.550" end="00:12:28.290" style="s2">to get to work and what you have now is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.250" end="00:12:29.730" style="s2">a basis where if the proposition goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.290" end="00:12:31.860" style="s2">through it will benefit some things than</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.730" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">harm other things and if it doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.860" end="00:12:35.190" style="s2">through the thing that would have been</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.029" end="00:12:39.779" style="s2">isn&#39;t harmed and so you will get an in</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.990" end="00:12:56.080" style="s2">radicalization and we didn&#39;t even try in</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.270" end="00:13:02.050" style="s2">of meeting everybody&#39;s needs was we</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.100" end="00:13:03.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t even try and do a context map of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.050" end="00:13:05.350" style="s2">what are all the interconnected issues</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.700" end="00:13:08.470" style="s2">here what would a good design that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.350" end="00:13:10.120" style="s2">everybody might like look like and can</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.470" end="00:13:11.710" style="s2">we even try to find a synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.120" end="00:13:15.190" style="s2">satisfy that&#39;s not even part of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.710" end="00:13:17.170" style="s2">conversation right maybe rather than</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.190" end="00:13:18.850" style="s2">make the bridge there we could make the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.170" end="00:13:20.380" style="s2">bridge a slightly different area and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.850" end="00:13:22.300" style="s2">there&#39;s no owls there maybe we can move</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.380" end="00:13:23.410" style="s2">boughs maybe we can use pontoon boats</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.300" end="00:13:25.420" style="s2">maybe we don&#39;t even need to make a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.410" end="00:13:27.160" style="s2">bridge because all the transportation go</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.420" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">back and forth is for one company and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.160" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">can just move the company&#39;s headquarters</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.890" style="s2">maybe but the sense making to inform the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:34.990" style="s2">choice making is not a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.890" end="00:13:38.350" style="s2">governance process so if I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.990" end="00:13:41.230" style="s2">choices blind or mostly blind based on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.350" end="00:13:42.610" style="s2">tiny part of the optics then other</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.230" end="00:13:43.780" style="s2">people who have other optics are like</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.610" end="00:13:47.020" style="s2">wait that&#39;s not a good choice and right</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.780" end="00:13:48.430" style="s2">now we both know that if one eye shows</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.020" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">something but my other eye shows</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.430" end="00:13:51.580" style="s2">something else I want to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:53.200" style="s2">to both eyes I don&#39;t want them in a game</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.200" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">right they do parallax and give me depth</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.670" end="00:13:58.990" style="s2">perception and my eyes and my ears don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.370" end="00:14:03.580" style="s2">functions but I also want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.420" end="00:14:04.900" style="s2">attention to each other because if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.580" end="00:14:06.220" style="s2">hear something and I think that it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.900" end="00:14:07.480" style="s2">over there I&#39;m gonna go away from it but</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.220" end="00:14:09.100" style="s2">my eyes tell me it&#39;s actually somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.480" end="00:14:11.290" style="s2">else like I want to pay attention to all</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.100" end="00:14:12.760" style="s2">of my sense making so my brain is doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.290" end="00:14:14.050" style="s2">is really interesting process of taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.760" end="00:14:15.160" style="s2">all of this different sensory</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.050" end="00:14:16.450" style="s2">information putting it together and</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.800" end="00:14:24.340" style="s2">that sends me we have never been able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.060" end="00:14:26.950" style="s2">think about governance processes like</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.340" end="00:14:28.810" style="s2">this where we start with how would a</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.140" end="00:16:22.450" style="s2">the thing that we&#39;ve called democracy</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.130" end="00:16:24.459" style="s2">right the thing that we&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.450" end="00:16:26.950" style="s2">democracy some process of a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.459" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">based on some very limited sense making</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.950" end="00:16:31.810" style="s2">with some majority that is always going</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:33.459" style="s2">to lead to polarization that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.810" end="00:16:35.410" style="s2">lead to the group that doesn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.459" end="00:16:37.029" style="s2">feeling disenfranchised and then having</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.410" end="00:16:38.350" style="s2">antipathy against the group as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.029" end="00:16:40.209" style="s2">and then you know the warfare that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.350" end="00:16:41.800" style="s2">occurs between them of whatever kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.209" end="00:16:44.110" style="s2">with our info warfare or actual warfare</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.800" end="00:16:45.910" style="s2">and so the reason I bring this up is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.110" end="00:16:49.000" style="s2">because like democracy was great</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.910" end="00:16:53.380" style="s2">compared to just like a terrible fascist</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.000" end="00:16:55.480" style="s2">dictator right but it definitely is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.380" end="00:16:57.880" style="s2">adequate to the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.480" end="00:16:59.589" style="s2">problems we have to solve nor can we</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.880" end="00:17:02.589" style="s2">continue to handle the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.589" end="00:17:04.900" style="s2">polarization and problematic dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.589" end="00:17:06.760" style="s2">that inexorably creates the same is true</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.900" end="00:17:08.860" style="s2">with capitalism the same is true with</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.760" end="00:17:10.419" style="s2">the thing that we call a science and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.860" end="00:17:11.650" style="s2">tack which is a probably the hardest one</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.419" end="00:17:14.110" style="s2">I&#39;ll get to that one last</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.650" end="00:17:15.579" style="s2">so the thing that we call capitalism we</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.110" end="00:17:18.309" style="s2">all know the positive story there that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.579" end="00:17:20.020" style="s2">it in cents people being self</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.309" end="00:17:21.939" style="s2">responsible and being industrious and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.020" end="00:17:23.800" style="s2">seeking to bring better products and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.939" end="00:17:25.449" style="s2">services to the market at a better value</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.800" end="00:17:27.220" style="s2">and those who do will get ahead and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.449" end="00:17:28.750" style="s2">should get ahead because they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.220" end="00:17:30.100" style="s2">be good stewards of resource because</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.750" end="00:17:31.870" style="s2">they got to resource by bringing</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.100" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">products and services at a value that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.870" end="00:17:35.980" style="s2">people cared about and etc like we know</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:37.870" style="s2">that that story right there&#39;s some truth</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.980" end="00:17:39.250" style="s2">to it like there was some twisted</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.870" end="00:17:40.960" style="s2">democracy story and it served</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.250" end="00:17:43.690" style="s2">evolutionary relevance and it most</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.960" end="00:17:46.809" style="s2">certainly can&#39;t take us the next set of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.690" end="00:17:49.750" style="s2">steps so you know for instance the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.809" end="00:17:51.250" style="s2">that we call money and ownership you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.750" end="00:17:53.470" style="s2">actually think of it related to</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.250" end="00:17:55.690" style="s2">governance as a type of choice making</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.470" end="00:17:58.360" style="s2">process if we don&#39;t think about deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.690" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">enough the nature of what these types of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.360" end="00:18:02.050" style="s2">structures are if I have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:04.570" style="s2">money it means I have concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.050" end="00:18:06.340" style="s2">choice making capacity because I can now</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.570" end="00:18:08.590" style="s2">want to make a choice that I can extend</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.340" end="00:18:10.660" style="s2">through a bunch of employees right I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.590" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">have a bunch of them working aligned</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.660" end="00:18:14.830" style="s2">with my sense making on my behalf to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">increase my actuator capacity or I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.830" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">get physical resources to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:22.929" style="s2">build something that extends my actuator</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:24.460" style="s2">capacity and so we recognize Oh a system</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.929" end="00:18:26.470" style="s2">that ends up determining who has</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.460" end="00:18:28.030" style="s2">resource and then the resource ends up</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.470" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">being a way that some people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.030" end="00:18:32.800" style="s2">actually directing the choice making of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:36.130" style="s2">other people is a choice making system</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.800" end="00:18:38.260" style="s2">and then we say well is that your shitty</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.130" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">choice making system because the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.260" end="00:18:42.100" style="s2">that those who have the money are better</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:44.110" style="s2">choice makers for the whole is just</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.100" end="00:18:46.420" style="s2">silly right like it&#39;s just really silly</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.110" end="00:18:47.980" style="s2">even if someone did bring good products</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.420" end="00:18:49.330" style="s2">or services to market effectively that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.980" end="00:18:51.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re kids who inherited</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.330" end="00:18:53.500" style="s2">it and it doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.850" end="00:18:55.870" style="s2">money by extraction rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.500" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">production that is net debasing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.870" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">environment and it doesn&#39;t mean that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:00.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t externalized I figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:02.410" style="s2">externalize more harm and cost to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.700" end="00:19:04.510" style="s2">Commons than somebody else did which</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.410" end="00:19:06.429" style="s2">drove my margins up so I got more of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.510" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t mean that I didn&#39;t do war</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.429" end="00:19:11.140" style="s2">profiteering right and so we search</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:13.270" style="s2">whereas okay well that&#39;s just actually a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.140" end="00:19:14.770" style="s2">shitty choice making system so we</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.270" end="00:19:16.090" style="s2">stopped even thinking about what is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.770" end="00:19:17.260" style="s2">future of economics in the future of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.090" end="00:19:19.240" style="s2">governance because the words are so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.260" end="00:19:21.160" style="s2">loaded that we just can&#39;t help ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.240" end="00:19:23.260" style="s2">but boot bad concepts when we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.160" end="00:19:24.580" style="s2">think of those words so we started</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.260" end="00:19:25.740" style="s2">thinking about all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.580" end="00:19:29.049" style="s2">as humans are making choices</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.740" end="00:19:30.970" style="s2">individually and in groups based on</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.049" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">information that we have towards some</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.970" end="00:19:35.880" style="s2">things that we value and hope to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:38.760" style="s2">happen right so how do we get better on</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.880" end="00:19:40.870" style="s2">value frameworks what we really seek to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.760" end="00:19:42.760" style="s2">benefit how do we get better on our</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.870" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">sense making processes and how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.760" end="00:19:46.120" style="s2">better on their choice making processes</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:49.059" style="s2">and what is the future of individual and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.120" end="00:19:52.990" style="s2">collective value framework sense making</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.059" end="00:19:54.610" style="s2">choice making processes and that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.990" end="00:19:56.710" style="s2">being what obsoletes the things we call</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.610" end="00:19:58.779" style="s2">economics and governance now now we come</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.710" end="00:20:00.460" style="s2">back to capitalism for a minute okay so</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.779" end="00:20:02.590" style="s2">not only is it just not a great choice</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.460" end="00:20:04.029" style="s2">making system and not only does it end</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.590" end="00:20:06.250" style="s2">up actually being a pretty pathological</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.029" end="00:20:07.929" style="s2">choice making system because it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.250" end="00:20:10.389" style="s2">to extract than it is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.929" end="00:20:11.860" style="s2">produce and it&#39;s easier to rip off with</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.389" end="00:20:12.970" style="s2">someone else worked really hard on than</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.860" end="00:20:14.860" style="s2">it is to work really hard on making</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.970" end="00:20:17.110" style="s2">thing and it&#39;s easier to externalize</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.860" end="00:20:19.149" style="s2">cost to the Commons than not and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.110" end="00:20:22.059" style="s2">know etc but we say ok it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.149" end="00:20:24.490" style="s2">that it said we&#39;ve got 70 trillion</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.059" end="00:20:26.409" style="s2">dollars worth of economic activity give</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.490" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">or take every day trade hands back on</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.409" end="00:20:30.519" style="s2">what you consider a dollar we&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:32.039" style="s2">much all of that externalizes harm at</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.519" end="00:20:33.340" style="s2">some point along the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.039" end="00:20:35.740" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.340" end="00:20:38.830" style="s2">the physical goods economy required</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.740" end="00:20:40.210" style="s2">mining and turns it into trash on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.830" end="00:20:42.070" style="s2">other side so the linear materials</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.210" end="00:20:43.450" style="s2">economy is disruptive to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.070" end="00:20:45.970" style="s2">causes pollution along the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:48.250" style="s2">etc causes marketing to be able to drive</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.970" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">it that is polluting people&#39;s minds with</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.250" end="00:20:54.399" style="s2">a bunch of manufactured discontent and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:56.830" style="s2">you know etc drives disinformation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.399" end="00:20:58.779" style="s2">some companies trying to just inform</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.830" end="00:21:01.480" style="s2">other ones to maintain strategic</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.779" end="00:21:04.779" style="s2">advantage is running on dollars that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.480" end="00:21:06.580" style="s2">supported by militaries and so you just</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.779" end="00:21:08.169" style="s2">think about the whole thing like wow ok</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.580" end="00:21:10.059" style="s2">even the things that I think are good</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.169" end="00:21:12.779" style="s2">like the just a movement of what those</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.059" end="00:21:15.179" style="s2">dollars are is externalizing harm in an</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.779" end="00:21:17.019" style="s2">exponential way that is moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.179" end="00:21:19.090" style="s2">catastrophic tipping points all right</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.019" end="00:21:23.230" style="s2">well that can&#39;t work and then even worse</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.090" end="00:21:24.730" style="s2">you say all right let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.230" end="00:21:27.429" style="s2">Facebook for a minute because Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.730" end="00:21:29.769" style="s2">since last time we talked between Russia</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.429" end="00:21:31.990" style="s2">and Cambridge analytic and Tristan and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.769" end="00:21:34.659" style="s2">etc there&#39;s a lot more understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.990" end="00:21:36.549" style="s2">the problem of platforms that have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.659" end="00:21:38.290" style="s2">of personal data but also have their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.549" end="00:21:41.890" style="s2">agency with respect to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.290" end="00:21:44.500" style="s2">and we say okay so Facebook wants to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.890" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">maximize time on site because there they</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.500" end="00:21:49.750" style="s2">make money by selling marketing and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">more users are on site more often more</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.750" end="00:21:54.520" style="s2">they can charge for the marketing so</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:57.490" style="s2">they figure out they used very complex</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.520" end="00:21:59.500" style="s2">AI analytics split testing etc to see</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.180" end="00:22:40.780" style="s2">if I can make you addicted to my stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.620" end="00:22:42.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the most profitable thing so when</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.780" end="00:22:44.560" style="s2">you look around at a society that has</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.160" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">ubiquitous rampant addiction of almost</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:50.680" style="s2">just good for business that&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.070" end="00:22:53.110" style="s2">GDP and so we see that Facebook is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.680" end="00:22:55.210" style="s2">by its own nature of doing what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.110" end="00:22:56.620" style="s2">supposed to do public company fiduciary</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.620" end="00:23:00.310" style="s2">profit blah blah blah is they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.420" end="00:23:01.720" style="s2">maximize your time on site and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.310" end="00:23:04.030" style="s2">maximizing your time on site is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.720" end="00:23:05.500" style="s2">work better by hyper normal stimuli that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.030" end="00:23:06.610" style="s2">make you addicted and by things that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.500" end="00:23:07.750" style="s2">make you sovereign work because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.610" end="00:23:08.560" style="s2">actually realize that your life is</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.750" end="00:23:09.790" style="s2">better when you get the off</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.560" end="00:23:12.280" style="s2">Facebook and go hang out with real</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.790" end="00:23:14.110" style="s2">people and so it has to drive addiction</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.280" end="00:23:15.850" style="s2">and discontent and whatever else and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.110" end="00:23:16.840" style="s2">it&#39;s really good at a bunch of crafty</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.850" end="00:23:19.330" style="s2">tricks for how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.840" end="00:23:21.100" style="s2">and so we see then that corresponding</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.330" end="00:23:24.100" style="s2">with that is the rise of bulimia and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.100" end="00:23:26.290" style="s2">anorexia and and all kinds of body</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.100" end="00:23:28.180" style="s2">dysmorphia we see that corresponding</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.290" end="00:23:30.430" style="s2">with it is depression and probability</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.180" end="00:23:33.340" style="s2">for suicide rates we see that the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.430" end="00:23:35.770" style="s2">normal stimuli of polarizing news grabs</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.340" end="00:23:37.180" style="s2">people more than like non polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.770" end="00:23:39.130" style="s2">news because fights in an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.180" end="00:23:40.390" style="s2">environment are really important things</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.130" end="00:23:43.270" style="s2">to pay attention to they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.390" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">hyper monel stimuli and so the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.270" end="00:23:47.470" style="s2">polarizing names are gonna show up on</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:49.390" style="s2">YouTube videos and get the most traction</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.470" end="00:23:50.770" style="s2">and you notice whenever there&#39;s a debate</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.390" end="00:23:52.120" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to be a friendly debate</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.770" end="00:23:53.410" style="s2">you look at the name</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.120" end="00:23:55.810" style="s2">the YouTube video that gets the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.410" end="00:23:58.600" style="s2">shares and it&#39;s so-and-so of this rate</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.810" end="00:23:59.980" style="s2">so-and-so right yeah destroys this</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.600" end="00:24:03.190" style="s2">person yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.980" end="00:24:04.840" style="s2">and that hyper normal stimuli grabs us</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.190" end="00:24:06.610" style="s2">in the basal ganglia and the worst way</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.840" end="00:24:09.100" style="s2">possible makes the worst versions of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.610" end="00:24:10.600" style="s2">but it maximizes time on site so</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.100" end="00:24:13.890" style="s2">now you look and you say okay so the net</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.600" end="00:24:16.050" style="s2">result of Facebook is increased</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.890" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">radicalization in all directions</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.050" end="00:24:20.530" style="s2">increased broken sense-making like</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:24.490" style="s2">decreased sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.530" end="00:24:25.900" style="s2">increased echo chamber and antipathy at</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.490" end="00:24:27.970" style="s2">a level that will increase both the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.900" end="00:24:29.920" style="s2">probability of civil wars and world wars</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.970" end="00:24:32.140" style="s2">and everything else and the increased</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.920" end="00:24:34.120" style="s2">teen depression and suicide rates and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.140" end="00:24:36.100" style="s2">shopping addictions and you&#39;re like wow</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.120" end="00:24:38.170" style="s2">this is evil right like this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.100" end="00:24:39.640" style="s2">a really terrible thing this Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.170" end="00:24:41.050" style="s2">want to do that we could almost make up</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.640" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">a conspiracy theory that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.050" end="00:24:44.410" style="s2">Facebook has optimized how to make the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:45.250" style="s2">world wars as fast as possible Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.410" end="00:24:46.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.250" end="00:24:49.210" style="s2">Facebook is just trying to make a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.870" end="00:24:51.700" style="s2">right and justify to itself that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.210" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">should continue to exist and it just</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.700" end="00:24:55.420" style="s2">happens to be that how it makes a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.920" style="s2">has the externality of all that stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.420" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">the same way that when Exxon was making</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.920" end="00:25:02.170" style="s2">$1 or when the military-industrial</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:04.030" style="s2">complex or a secure industry that makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.170" end="00:25:06.460" style="s2">money when people are sick and not when</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.030" end="00:25:07.690" style="s2">they&#39;re healthy like okay so look</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.460" end="00:25:12.820" style="s2">at that right</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.690" end="00:25:16.780" style="s2">so capitalism is inexorably bound to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.820" end="00:25:19.030" style="s2">perverse incentive everywhere and at an</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.780" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">even deeper structural level if we tried</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.030" end="00:25:25.420" style="s2">to fix that we&#39;d say okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:27.400" style="s2">competing to own stuff and the moment</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.420" end="00:25:30.070" style="s2">you own something I no longer have</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.400" end="00:25:31.750" style="s2">access to it even if you&#39;re not using it</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.750" end="00:25:35.920" style="s2">whatever it is right drill you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.330" end="00:25:38.560" style="s2">even remember where you put it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.920" end="00:25:40.890" style="s2">have an access to it and as a result and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.560" end="00:25:43.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a scarce amount of the stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.890" end="00:25:45.310" style="s2">the stuff that is more scarce we make</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.450" end="00:25:47.470" style="s2">more valuable and so then you own it I</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.310" end="00:25:49.510" style="s2">don&#39;t have access to it but because you</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.470" end="00:25:50.650" style="s2">want to be able to provide for your</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.510" end="00:25:52.510" style="s2">future and whatever and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.650" end="00:25:53.530" style="s2">uncertainty you want to own all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.510" end="00:25:55.450" style="s2">that you can and pull it out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.530" end="00:25:57.730" style="s2">circulation put it in safes and security</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.450" end="00:25:59.470" style="s2">boxes so that takes a lot of resource</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.730" end="00:26:02.020" style="s2">from the earth where everything you own</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.470" end="00:26:03.640" style="s2">is just bothering me because it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.020" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">removed from my possible access so we</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.640" end="00:26:06.040" style="s2">are in a rival wrist relationship with</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.040" end="00:26:09.910" style="s2">because the nature of the good itself is</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.670" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">say well it makes sense why we&#39;d value</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.680" end="00:26:21.190" style="s2">scarce things because if there&#39;s enough</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.090" end="00:26:29.260" style="s2">makes sense except the problem of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.950" end="00:26:31.450" style="s2">is if we make decisions based on an</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.730" end="00:27:49.690" style="s2">and of course we see that the moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.530" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">that we make abundant things worthless</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:57.760" style="s2">and we make scarce things worth a lot</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.760" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">creates a basis to artificially</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:14.620" style="s2">I make some software that I could give</p>

<p begin="00:28:14.620" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">made it I just have to make enough money</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.210" end="00:28:31.869" style="s2">artificially manufacture scarcity to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:33.970" style="s2">keep driving my a balance sheet of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.869" end="00:28:35.619" style="s2">course the Kimberly diamond mines burn</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.970" end="00:28:36.879" style="s2">and crushed their diamonds because we</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.619" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">thought diamonds were scarce for me at</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.879" end="00:28:39.489" style="s2">the price I then we realized they</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.049" style="s2">weren&#39;t scarce if people had the price I</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.489" end="00:28:43.059" style="s2">didn&#39;t want that to be known and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.049" end="00:28:44.919" style="s2">know etc accelerating so if we want a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.059" end="00:28:46.119" style="s2">world of abundance for everybody we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.919" end="00:28:47.559" style="s2">actually make it technologically</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.119" end="00:28:48.999" style="s2">engineer the scarcity out create</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.559" end="00:28:50.350" style="s2">abundance everywhere is a feasible thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.999" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">to do we can talk more about that later</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.350" end="00:28:54.940" style="s2">but you can&#39;t in have an incentive on</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:57.279" style="s2">scarcity and engineer it out at the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.940" end="00:29:00.039" style="s2">time right so now they&#39;re scarce stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:29:01.690" style="s2">we&#39;re competing for it you own it which</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.039" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">means you possess it and you remove my</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.690" end="00:29:08.019" style="s2">capacity for access and so I want to own</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:10.179" style="s2">it faster than you own it and so then I</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.019" end="00:29:12.100" style="s2">know and now we get into a tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.179" end="00:29:14.470" style="s2">the Commons and a multipolar trap thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.100" end="00:29:16.690" style="s2">to say I go cut down a tree in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.470" end="00:29:19.029" style="s2">forest I don&#39;t need that many trees</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.690" end="00:29:20.590" style="s2">right now but you&#39;re in this other tribe</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.029" end="00:29:22.629" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna go cut down some of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.590" end="00:29:23.830" style="s2">trees I would like there to be a forest</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.629" end="00:29:25.299" style="s2">rather than a total clear-cut</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.830" end="00:29:26.710" style="s2">environments for store beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.299" end="00:29:28.509" style="s2">they grew up with the forests and I like</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.710" end="00:29:31.359" style="s2">the animals that are there but I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.509" end="00:29:32.739" style="s2">that if I don&#39;t cut down the trees and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.359" end="00:29:33.999" style="s2">leave the trees they&#39;re still won&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.739" end="00:29:35.739" style="s2">forest because you&#39;re gonna cut down the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.999" end="00:29:37.149" style="s2">trees and since you&#39;re gonna cut down</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.739" end="00:29:38.590" style="s2">the trees and the other guy the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.149" end="00:29:40.929" style="s2">tribe knows that and they know that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.590" end="00:29:42.519" style="s2">going to and so we say it I gotta</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.929" end="00:29:44.590" style="s2">cut down all the trees as fast as I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.519" end="00:29:45.940" style="s2">because if they&#39;re gonna be no trees</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.590" end="00:29:47.289" style="s2">anyways I might as well get them rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.940" end="00:29:48.759" style="s2">than them get them because if they have</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.289" end="00:29:50.679" style="s2">increased economic power over me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.759" end="00:29:52.690" style="s2">gonna use those pieces of wood against</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.679" end="00:29:55.450" style="s2">me and more in an economic competition</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.690" end="00:29:57.070" style="s2">and for now we all increase the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.450" end="00:29:58.330" style="s2">the destruction of the forest as fast as</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.070" end="00:29:59.739" style="s2">we can even though we&#39;d all like</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.330" end="00:30:01.720" style="s2">a forest because we&#39;re caught in a</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.720" end="00:30:06.940" style="s2">good way out so the tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.940" end="00:30:09.220" style="s2">Commons is a multipolar or trap the arms</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.940" end="00:30:11.980" style="s2">race where we say you know what we</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.450" end="00:30:19.149" style="s2">everyone in the world thinks that the</p>

<p begin="00:30:21.850" end="00:30:25.539" style="s2">better not to live in right like nobody</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.799" end="00:30:26.889" style="s2">wants live in that world because it</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.629" end="00:30:32.570" style="s2">of beds in here is normal but we&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.570" end="00:30:35.990" style="s2"> tack why are we doing that why</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.580" end="00:30:38.659" style="s2">don&#39;t we just make a treaty not to do it</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.990" end="00:30:41.179" style="s2">because we make a treaty we secretly</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.659" end="00:30:43.159" style="s2">know that the other guy&#39;s gonna defect</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.179" end="00:30:44.509" style="s2">on it secretly because if he gets the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.159" end="00:30:47.029" style="s2">tech first he&#39;ll rule the world and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.509" end="00:30:49.610" style="s2">he&#39;ll beat us and he knows that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.610" end="00:30:53.740" style="s2">treaty and we all defect on it secretly</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.500" end="00:30:56.059" style="s2">while agreeing to it publicly well</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:23.179" style="s2">multipolar trap so please remind me to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.450" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">do it one of the things we have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.179" end="00:31:28.100" style="s2">at a generator function level is</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.769" end="00:31:38.090" style="s2">because a multipolar trap basically</p>

<p begin="00:32:33.259" end="00:32:36.950" style="s2">of it we know that when you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.429" end="00:32:38.840" style="s2">shop to the grocery store and you use a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.950" end="00:32:40.220" style="s2">shopping cart you don&#39;t bring your own</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.840" end="00:32:42.350" style="s2">shopping cart that you own which would</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.220" end="00:32:45.049" style="s2">be a major pain in the ass and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.350" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">do that you have access to a cart where</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.169" end="00:33:02.340" style="s2">over carts and because I only need</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.909" end="00:33:04.890" style="s2">enough for there to be enough during</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.340" end="00:33:07.020" style="s2">peak time which is maybe 200 people only</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.890" end="00:33:09.090" style="s2">need 200 cart learn plenty cart train</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.020" end="00:33:12.360" style="s2">even though that store might service</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.090" end="00:33:14.400" style="s2">10,000 people months so think about 200</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.360" end="00:33:16.950" style="s2">carts vs. 10,000 carts how much less</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.400" end="00:33:19.289" style="s2">resource it is from the environment how</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.950" end="00:33:20.760" style="s2">much more efficient it is so now you</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.289" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">start saying all right well let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.760" end="00:33:25.350" style="s2">at other places where this thing could</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:28.590" style="s2">happen say well we&#39;ve owned cars as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.350" end="00:33:30.779" style="s2">good and when you own a car I no longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.590" end="00:33:32.010" style="s2">have access to it but then you&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.779" end="00:33:33.330" style="s2">just gonna leave it sitting and hardly</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.010" end="00:33:34.770" style="s2">ever use it you&#39;ll use it now and again</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.330" end="00:33:37.710" style="s2">distance been 95 percent of it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.770" end="00:33:40.590" style="s2">just sitting places and as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.710" end="00:33:42.330" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of cars to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.590" end="00:33:44.490" style="s2">not provide that much transportation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.330" end="00:33:46.230" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of metals taken out of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.490" end="00:33:48.899" style="s2">earth and a lot of plastics and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.230" end="00:33:50.730" style="s2">you know actual environmental costs to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.899" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">be able to make those to have most of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.730" end="00:33:55.020" style="s2">them never in use now you start to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:56.490" style="s2">okay well we look at car sharing like</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.020" end="00:34:00.059" style="s2">uber and lyft and whatever and we start</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.490" end="00:34:03.029" style="s2">moving there from a possession of a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.059" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">to an access of a service that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.029" end="00:34:06.390" style="s2">cool I&#39;m still gonna pay for it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:08.099" style="s2">still kind of shitty because there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.390" end="00:34:09.240" style="s2">enough of it to have give me good access</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.099" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">everywhere but it&#39;s pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.240" end="00:34:13.530" style="s2">imagine did that thing takes over right</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:15.240" style="s2">and then you use something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.530" end="00:34:16.589" style="s2">blockchain to disintermediate the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.240" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">central company that&#39;s pulling the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.589" end="00:34:20.820" style="s2">profits out of it and so now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">cheaper access for everybody and puts</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.820" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">more resource back into the quality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:26.250" style="s2">a transportation and then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:28.260" style="s2">self-driving cars so it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.250" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">even have that cost it&#39;s just a self</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.260" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">maintaining dynamic an you say okay now</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:33.659" style="s2">it takes a tiny fraction of the metals</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">coming out of the earth to provide</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.659" end="00:34:39.629" style="s2">higher quality transportation units for</p>

<p begin="00:35:39.800" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">like right now but to just start giving</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.330" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">a sense that when we think about the</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:50.420" style="s2">been problems associated with it forever</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.670" end="00:35:52.490" style="s2">and but the scale of the problems is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.420" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">just more catastrophic now but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.490" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">sharing examples of ways that we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">start shifting some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:35:59.990" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t shift previously some of the</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.990" end="00:36:04.040" style="s2">available to them and this is very</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.940" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">interesting we have to shift all these</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.040" end="00:36:07.990" style="s2">systems and we can at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">this is to me a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.990" end="00:36:12.920" style="s2">developmental insight when I look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:15.020" style="s2">biology in particular is that if we look</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.920" end="00:36:17.330" style="s2">at the 40 weeks of a baby in utero it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.020" end="00:36:18.710" style="s2">can&#39;t actually we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.330" end="00:36:21.110" style="s2">before but I bring it up again in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.710" end="00:36:24.110" style="s2">context it couldn&#39;t be born much earlier</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.110" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">it would be preemie and without and ICU</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.110" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">for it or whatever it would die but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:28.610" style="s2">also couldn&#39;t stay much longer</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:29.960" style="s2">you could get too big and never be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.610" end="00:36:32.030" style="s2">to be born and kill the mom and kill</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.960" end="00:36:35.150" style="s2">itself it comes out in a pretty narrow</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.030" end="00:36:36.860" style="s2">window where both for the first time can</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.150" end="00:36:38.990" style="s2">it actually now has the capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.860" end="00:36:41.090" style="s2">hostage can&#39;t stay any longer and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.990" end="00:36:42.980" style="s2">interesting that this it&#39;s got 40 weeks</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.090" end="00:36:44.450" style="s2">on one growth path right it&#39;s growing</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.980" end="00:36:45.860" style="s2">the whole time there&#39;s a growth curve</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.450" end="00:36:47.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna stay on that growth curve</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.860" end="00:36:49.190" style="s2">forever if we tried to forecast its</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.330" end="00:36:51.080" style="s2">future and just continue the progression</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.190" end="00:36:53.000" style="s2">of 40 weeks around 50 weeks it kills</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.080" end="00:36:54.950" style="s2">itself in the mom right so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.000" end="00:36:56.840" style="s2">the thing it goes through this discrete</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.950" end="00:36:58.340" style="s2">nonlinear phase shift that if I had</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.840" end="00:37:01.310" style="s2">never seen it before I&#39;d have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.340" end="00:37:03.530" style="s2">how to predict and out of the birth</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.280" end="00:37:13.100" style="s2">40 weeks of its existence previously so</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:14.930" style="s2">if I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.100" end="00:37:17.090" style="s2">the curve of what has been it is not bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.930" end="00:37:19.100" style="s2">and it does it both when it has to end</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.090" end="00:37:21.740" style="s2">can and if we look at any type of</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.500" end="00:37:29.090" style="s2">earlier is still goo if it tried to stay</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.810" end="00:37:31.040" style="s2">in later it starts if we look at a</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.040" end="00:37:34.250" style="s2">chrysalis same thing if it tried to just</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.870" end="00:37:36.170" style="s2">keep eating it would eat itself to</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:47.210" style="s2">this is really interesting that when we</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.190" end="00:37:48.920" style="s2">look at discrete nonlinear phase shifts</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.210" end="00:37:49.940" style="s2">where there&#39;s one phase right the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.920" end="00:37:51.590" style="s2">caterpillar is getting bigger and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.940" end="00:37:53.750" style="s2">and bigger eating everything in its</p>

<p begin="00:37:53.750" end="00:37:57.950" style="s2">keeps being there I forecast it eats all</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.090" end="00:38:23.990" style="s2">look bad then it just goes into self</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:25.850" style="s2">extinction it&#39;s neither of those curves</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.990" end="00:38:28.190" style="s2">right cuz is getting exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.850" end="00:38:30.230" style="s2">more powerful which means better and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.190" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">worse at the same time but that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.230" end="00:38:33.560" style="s2">it&#39;s neither of those curves that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:36.200" style="s2">that this phase is just coming to an end</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.560" end="00:38:37.790" style="s2">it&#39;s destabilizing the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.200" end="00:38:39.140" style="s2">getting exponentially worse will in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.790" end="00:38:41.120" style="s2">phase before the things that are getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.140" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">exponentially better will change the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.120" end="00:38:43.940" style="s2">nature of those things but that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:46.430" style="s2">that what we&#39;re actually going to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.940" end="00:38:49.220" style="s2">something altogether other if it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.430" end="00:38:50.510" style="s2">other than extinction and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.220" end="00:38:52.940" style="s2">interesting that we&#39;re at the place</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.510" end="00:38:55.670" style="s2">where these types of dynamics both have</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.940" end="00:38:57.560" style="s2">to change right now because that we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.670" end="00:38:59.330" style="s2">catastrophic level tech that we never</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.560" end="00:39:02.210" style="s2">had to have the same things that always</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.330" end="00:39:03.620" style="s2">suck to be unsurvivable and can change</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.210" end="00:39:05.810" style="s2">because we actually have the level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.620" end="00:39:07.550" style="s2">insights that make possible things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.810" end="00:39:10.790" style="s2">are different at a deep enough axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.550" end="00:39:12.200" style="s2">level if it&#39;s kind of like when you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.790" end="00:39:13.490" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a bunch of cells competing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.200" end="00:39:15.410" style="s2">against each other and then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.490" end="00:39:17.180" style="s2">metamorphosis for now they&#39;re inside of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.410" end="00:39:18.830" style="s2">a slime mold and they&#39;re act and there</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.180" end="00:39:20.210" style="s2">are part of the multicellular organism</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.830" end="00:39:21.500" style="s2">where they&#39;re participating together as</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.210" end="00:39:23.590" style="s2">part of a shared identity that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.500" end="00:39:25.870" style="s2">really deep level of reorganization and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.590" end="00:39:29.410" style="s2">people going from that shift</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.870" end="00:39:31.690" style="s2">as separate rival risk competitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.410" end="00:39:33.790" style="s2">agents modeling themselves as apex</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.690" end="00:39:35.650" style="s2">predators trying to compete with each</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.790" end="00:39:39.160" style="s2">other to be the most apex predator and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.650" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">predate the environment so we modelled</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.160" end="00:39:41.860" style="s2">ourselves as apex predators right there</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:43.450" style="s2">was an easy thing to do we look around</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.860" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">at nature and we were like we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.450" end="00:39:48.190" style="s2">more like lions than gazelles we look a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:50.140" style="s2">lot like chimpanzees they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.190" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">badass hunter apex predator they</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.140" end="00:39:53.800" style="s2">coordinate etcetera so we&#39;re like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.900" style="s2">cruel to the apex predator thing so we</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.800" end="00:39:57.940" style="s2">both want to see where we can get in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.900" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">dominance hierarchies and we get add the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.940" end="00:40:02.470" style="s2">prestige hierarchy but how we do within</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:04.750" style="s2">our tribe but in our tribe as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.470" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">our species as a whole relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.750" end="00:40:08.710" style="s2">other species is ins kind of apex</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:10.450" style="s2">position there&#39;s a reason why we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.710" end="00:40:11.110" style="s2">think that way anymore and again we felt</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.450" end="00:40:12.880" style="s2">this way forever</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.110" end="00:40:14.170" style="s2">and we cannot take this way anymore when</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.880" end="00:40:15.730" style="s2">I say we thought this way forever I</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.170" end="00:40:17.260" style="s2">don&#39;t mean every indigenous tribe talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.730" end="00:40:19.510" style="s2">this way because they didn&#39;t write they</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.260" end="00:40:21.640" style="s2">had a web of life and were merely a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.510" end="00:40:23.110" style="s2">strand and it types of thoughts but the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.640" end="00:40:24.340" style="s2">ones that thought this way became more</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.110" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">apex predators and killed those other</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.340" end="00:40:29.170" style="s2">people and so it was effective to try</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.940" style="s2">and do this apex predator thing up till</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.170" end="00:40:32.290" style="s2">now but now it also destroys everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.940" end="00:40:34.570" style="s2">so again the thing that has been</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.290" end="00:40:36.430" style="s2">adaptive is now anti adaptive which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.570" end="00:40:37.930" style="s2">why the thoughts that have made us win</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.430" end="00:40:41.650" style="s2">or the thoughts that make us extinct now</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.930" end="00:40:45.880" style="s2">and so if I take any pix predator how</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.650" end="00:40:47.650" style="s2">its ability to be a predator its ability</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.880" end="00:40:49.030" style="s2">to kill other things and compete with</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.650" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">the other predators for who&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.030" end="00:40:54.760" style="s2">badass is pretty fixed and it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:57.580" style="s2">symmetrically bound with its environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.760" end="00:40:59.410" style="s2">so lions can&#39;t get better at killing</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.580" end="00:41:02.380" style="s2">faster than gazelles get better at</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.410" end="00:41:04.510" style="s2">running and so they Co evolved where the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.380" end="00:41:05.980" style="s2">lion slowly get a little bit better at</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.510" end="00:41:07.360" style="s2">some things and the gazelles also get</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.980" end="00:41:09.430" style="s2">better at other things because if the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.360" end="00:41:10.810" style="s2">Lions just rapidly got way better they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.430" end="00:41:12.520" style="s2">kill all the gazelles and then debase</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.810" end="00:41:14.290" style="s2">their own capacity to keep living and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.520" end="00:41:16.330" style="s2">then they&#39;d be extinct if great white</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.290" end="00:41:17.620" style="s2">could make mile-long drift nets and just</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.330" end="00:41:19.690" style="s2">take all the fish out of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.620" end="00:41:21.790" style="s2">ocean and reproduce at an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.690" end="00:41:23.410" style="s2">rate like they would have already self</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.790" end="00:41:25.390" style="s2">induced extinction but they can&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.410" end="00:41:27.610" style="s2">the years the great rice never got a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.390" end="00:41:29.740" style="s2">driftnet but we have drift nets and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.610" end="00:41:31.950" style="s2">have nuclear weapons and we have D nines</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.740" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">and we have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.950" end="00:41:39.020" style="s2">technologically extend our predatory</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:41.540" style="s2">capacity and to do so in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.020" end="00:41:43.590" style="s2">exponential and that makes us completely</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.540" end="00:41:45.810" style="s2">asymmetric with the environment that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.590" end="00:41:47.700" style="s2">depend on so again I come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.810" end="00:41:50.130" style="s2">lion and they say all right the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.700" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">badass lion the most badass gorilla is</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.130" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">not like 10x more badass than the next</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:58.050" style="s2">most badass grow up</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:59.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like marginally better right like</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.050" end="00:42:01.020" style="s2">marginally can win in a fight and only</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.640" end="00:42:03.030" style="s2">for a pretty short period of time before</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.020" end="00:42:06.870" style="s2">the next guy takes it but then you look</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.030" end="00:42:08.700" style="s2">at like a Putin or a Trump and you say</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.870" end="00:42:10.830" style="s2">how much military capacity does that one</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.700" end="00:42:12.390" style="s2">person have to bear if they wanted to or</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.830" end="00:42:15.030" style="s2">economic capacity compared to say a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.390" end="00:42:17.100" style="s2">homeless guy you look at the spread and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.030" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh this is a very different</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.100" end="00:42:21.540" style="s2">distribution of power than any other</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:24.270" style="s2">species has other species did not have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.540" end="00:42:27.360" style="s2">million x power dynamics within the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.270" end="00:42:29.910" style="s2">species or a billion X that like it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.360" end="00:42:31.590" style="s2">freaking tremendous or that much more</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.910" end="00:42:34.110" style="s2">power relative to their environment so</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.590" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">if the Lions could get technologically</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.110" end="00:42:38.520" style="s2">more advanced in their predation faster</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:40.470" style="s2">than gazelles could it would debase the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.520" end="00:42:42.270" style="s2">stability of the entire ecosystem the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.470" end="00:42:44.280" style="s2">thing to realize is like if a cancer</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.270" end="00:42:45.510" style="s2">cell starts replicating in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.280" end="00:42:47.100" style="s2">good for it it&#39;s actually getting more</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.510" end="00:42:49.590" style="s2">sugar and replicating faster inside the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.100" end="00:42:51.270" style="s2">body if it keeps doing that it kills its</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.590" end="00:42:53.640" style="s2">host and kills itself it is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.270" end="00:42:55.860" style="s2">suicidal its own short-term success is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.640" end="00:42:57.990" style="s2">suicidal viruses that kill people too</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.860" end="00:42:59.400" style="s2">quickly don&#39;t propagate for very long</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.990" end="00:43:00.840" style="s2">because they kill their hosts they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.400" end="00:43:03.060" style="s2">get a chance to propagate the viruses</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.840" end="00:43:04.470" style="s2">that are less lethal end up being the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.060" end="00:43:05.730" style="s2">ones that gets selected for over a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.470" end="00:43:07.650" style="s2">longer period of time to get a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.730" end="00:43:09.090" style="s2">propagate so if there was a species that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.650" end="00:43:10.470" style="s2">was so good at hunting that it killed</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.090" end="00:43:12.870" style="s2">everything in its environment then it</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.470" end="00:43:15.090" style="s2">would go extinct so it&#39;s not the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.870" end="00:43:17.550" style="s2">competitive advantage that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.090" end="00:43:20.600" style="s2">through its self stabilizing ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.550" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">that make it through just such a way</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.600" end="00:43:26.190" style="s2">more complete understanding of evolution</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.090" end="00:43:54.110" style="s2">infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.950" end="00:43:56.120" style="s2">like it has to go through that phase</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.110" end="00:43:59.240" style="s2">shift yeah survival of the fittest was</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.120" end="00:44:02.840" style="s2">something that had a local truth but was</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.240" end="00:44:03.860" style="s2">not the only global phenomena that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.840" end="00:44:05.960" style="s2">operating because there was also a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.860" end="00:44:08.060" style="s2">tremendous amount of cooperation it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.960" end="00:44:09.530" style="s2">happening in cooperation within members</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.060" end="00:44:11.690" style="s2">of a species with each other and between</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.530" end="00:44:13.670" style="s2">species and interdependence on each</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.690" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">other and so but again it was like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.670" end="00:44:17.450" style="s2">almost the idea of competition it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:19.370" style="s2">hyper normal stimuli it was like an</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.450" end="00:44:21.320" style="s2">early hyper normal stimuli hijack like</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.370" end="00:44:23.810" style="s2">sugar and porn and airbrushed pictures</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.320" end="00:44:25.490" style="s2">and likes on Facebook because in an</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.810" end="00:44:27.290" style="s2">evolutionary environment sites stand out</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.490" end="00:44:29.720" style="s2">even though they&#39;re not mostly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.290" end="00:44:31.400" style="s2">happening right like mostly if I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.720" end="00:44:33.050" style="s2">forest there&#39;s a gazillion interactions</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.400" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">happening every second of aerobic and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.050" end="00:44:36.320" style="s2">anaerobic soil bacteria having a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:38.090" style="s2">relationship with each other and gas</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.320" end="00:44:40.070" style="s2">exchange between me and the plants it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.090" end="00:44:42.140" style="s2">just boring but it&#39;s like almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.070" end="00:44:43.550" style="s2">everything but then I see a couple lions</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.140" end="00:44:45.010" style="s2">fighting in like oh that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.550" end="00:44:47.900" style="s2">interesting rights to rebel with fittest</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.010" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">so there is this hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.900" end="00:44:53.090" style="s2">that made us actually miss emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:54.440" style="s2">what was happening as a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.090" end="00:44:57.050" style="s2">phenomena that was not all of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.440" end="00:44:58.130" style="s2">phenomena miss emphasizes now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.050" end="00:44:59.570" style="s2">also this thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.130" end="00:45:02.450" style="s2">there&#39;s we&#39;re moving forward right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.570" end="00:45:05.030" style="s2">the way we have been applying that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.450" end="00:45:07.970" style="s2">thinking which is that some individual</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:10.190" style="s2">agents or some in groups countries</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.970" end="00:45:13.430" style="s2">companies races whatever some in groups</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.190" end="00:45:16.370" style="s2">can be more fit to survive than others</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.430" end="00:45:18.500" style="s2">through better militaries or better</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.370" end="00:45:21.470" style="s2">economic extraction tech or bettered</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:24.980" style="s2">info and disinfo and narrative tech that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.470" end="00:45:26.510" style="s2">has always been true I&#39;m not criticising</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.980" end="00:45:30.320" style="s2">that that was always true and even</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.510" end="00:45:33.530" style="s2">necessary because if one tribe killed</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.320" end="00:45:35.030" style="s2">another tribe and their life got better</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.530" end="00:45:36.500" style="s2">because now the other tribe wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.030" end="00:45:38.390" style="s2">competing for pigs with them and now</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.500" end="00:45:39.830" style="s2">they got all the pigs and they got like</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:41.180" style="s2">all the stone tools that our tribe it</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.830" end="00:45:42.530" style="s2">may whatever they&#39;re like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.180" end="00:45:44.150" style="s2">realized that that&#39;s like killing other</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.530" end="00:45:46.190" style="s2">tribes thing is actually a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.150" end="00:45:48.050" style="s2">evolutionary strategy now all the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.190" end="00:45:50.510" style="s2">tribes have to build militaries or die</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.050" end="00:45:53.090" style="s2">by default right the win-lose game</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.510" end="00:45:55.400" style="s2">becomes obligate so one the win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.090" end="00:45:57.650" style="s2">game worked it actually worked if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.400" end="00:45:59.330" style="s2">were good at it and two it was obligate</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.650" end="00:46:02.060" style="s2">which is if you didn&#39;t do it you got</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.330" end="00:46:03.800" style="s2">killed by Genghis Khan or Alexander the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.060" end="00:46:05.380" style="s2">Great or whoever the it was right</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.800" end="00:46:07.300" style="s2">when we look at culture</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.380" end="00:46:09.100" style="s2">that did not focus on militaries but</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.300" end="00:46:11.770" style="s2">focused on the arts and humanities and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.100" end="00:46:14.020" style="s2">education and healthcare and etc that</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.770" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">out competed the other cultures in terms</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.020" end="00:46:18.790" style="s2">of quality of life but that wasn&#39;t where</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:21.040" style="s2">that the thing actually got decided they</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.790" end="00:46:23.290" style="s2">all got murdered and the really</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:24.700" style="s2">effective murdering cultures combined</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.290" end="00:46:26.950" style="s2">and combined and made it through and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.700" end="00:46:28.060" style="s2">that&#39;s us today and yet the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.950" end="00:46:29.830" style="s2">murdering and their tools of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.060" end="00:46:31.720" style="s2">environmental extraction are going up</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.830" end="00:46:33.370" style="s2">and up until we&#39;re at a level where the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.720" end="00:46:34.330" style="s2">playing field just cannot handle that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.370" end="00:46:36.820" style="s2">game anymore</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.330" end="00:46:38.050" style="s2">you can&#39;t keep extracting more stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.820" end="00:46:40.570" style="s2">from the environment when you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.050" end="00:46:42.100" style="s2">got peak resource when you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.570" end="00:46:44.280" style="s2">biodiversity issues and species</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.100" end="00:46:47.010" style="s2">extinction issues and etc you can&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.280" end="00:46:49.720" style="s2">polluting an environment when you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.010" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">dead zones in the ocean from nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.720" end="00:46:54.670" style="s2">runoff and co2 levels in the air and etc</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:56.920" style="s2">getting to the point of Cataclysm and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.670" end="00:46:59.650" style="s2">you can&#39;t keep doing increasing military</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.920" end="00:47:02.830" style="s2">tech at following exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.650" end="00:47:05.260" style="s2">curves we&#39;re then non-state actors can</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.830" end="00:47:08.080" style="s2">have fully catastrophic level tech and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.260" end="00:47:09.790" style="s2">you can&#39;t even monitor it you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.080" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">keep playing that game and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.790" end="00:47:14.290" style="s2">the gist is that the thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">always defined the game is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.290" end="00:47:18.040" style="s2">always been a rival risk game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">environment and the rival risk game</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.040" end="00:47:22.810" style="s2">theoretic environment if it can produce</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:24.310" style="s2">tech that keeps increasing will always</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.810" end="00:47:26.260" style="s2">self-terminate at a point and we just</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.310" end="00:47:29.170" style="s2">happen to be in the eminence of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.260" end="00:47:32.080" style="s2">point so this is the first generator</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.170" end="00:47:32.920" style="s2">function of X risk now we tie this over</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.080" end="00:47:34.270" style="s2">back to the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.920" end="00:47:37.120" style="s2">conversation and I obviously got</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.270" end="00:47:39.250" style="s2">long-winded the beginning conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.120" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">we said why are we focusing on risk well</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.250" end="00:47:45.580" style="s2">if we&#39;re focused on how do we design a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:47.710" style="s2">civilization that is actually good</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.580" end="00:47:50.170" style="s2">enough it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s desirable</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.710" end="00:47:51.700" style="s2">those are hard terms and we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.170" end="00:47:53.800" style="s2">that in a minute that starts to get to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.700" end="00:47:55.420" style="s2">some of the inadequacy of the thing we</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.800" end="00:47:57.670" style="s2">call science right now and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.420" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">commensurability with ethics get to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.670" end="00:48:02.200" style="s2">but what does a beautiful civilization</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:05.140" style="s2">look like well the first thing we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.200" end="00:48:07.900" style="s2">say kind of easily is that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.140" end="00:48:09.730" style="s2">self terminate if itself terminates we</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.900" end="00:48:13.240" style="s2">can mostly all agree that&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.730" end="00:48:15.580" style="s2">a desirable thing so if it is inexorably</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.240" end="00:48:17.380" style="s2">self terminating it is structurally self</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.580" end="00:48:18.609" style="s2">terminating not just kind of like one</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.380" end="00:48:20.769" style="s2">little accident that we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.609" end="00:48:22.150" style="s2">but over determined through mini vectors</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.769" end="00:48:22.839" style="s2">because of underlying generator</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.150" end="00:48:24.849" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.839" end="00:48:27.609" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good civilization design so</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.849" end="00:48:29.109" style="s2">the first design criteria of an</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.609" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">effective civilization is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.109" end="00:48:31.779" style="s2">self determining so then we say well</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:32.859" style="s2">what are the things that cost</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.779" end="00:48:35.380" style="s2">self-termination</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.859" end="00:48:38.019" style="s2">and what we find is that even though</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.380" end="00:48:39.819" style="s2">there are a gazillion different ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.019" end="00:48:41.619" style="s2">that it can express ways that it can</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.819" end="00:48:43.089" style="s2">actually happen it&#39;s from some very deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.619" end="00:48:45.160" style="s2">underlying dynamics that if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.089" end="00:48:48.249" style="s2">understand those and we solve them at</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.160" end="00:48:50.230" style="s2">the dynamics level we fix all of them so</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.249" end="00:48:51.579" style="s2">the first one is this topic we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.230" end="00:48:54.359" style="s2">talking about and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.579" end="00:48:57.039" style="s2">previously which is the rival risk games</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.359" end="00:48:58.900" style="s2">multiplied by exponential technology</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.039" end="00:49:02.140" style="s2">self-determining because rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.900" end="00:49:03.970" style="s2">games cause harm with power and more</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.140" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">power ends up being more harm until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.970" end="00:49:08.140" style="s2">more than more than is handleable a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:09.759" style="s2">playing field we got that so exponential</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.140" end="00:49:12.789" style="s2">tech whether we&#39;re looking at a scenario</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.759" end="00:49:16.809" style="s2">of everything getting up by AI or</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.789" end="00:49:19.539" style="s2">by bio warfare or by nanotech stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.809" end="00:49:21.970" style="s2">by read so many different types of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.539" end="00:49:24.730" style="s2">scenarios those are all the same types</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.970" end="00:49:26.349" style="s2">of choices humans have been making just</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.730" end="00:49:28.359" style="s2">with those exponential powers at it</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.349" end="00:49:30.819" style="s2">given that we cannot put those</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.359" end="00:49:32.680" style="s2">technologies away we cannot get the</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.680" end="00:49:38.349" style="s2">often this we could we either figure out</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:40.569" style="s2">how to move from arrival risk to an anti</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.349" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">rival RIF environment that is developing</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.569" end="00:49:45.309" style="s2">and deploying those technologies or we</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:48.670" style="s2">self-terminate so this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.309" end="00:49:51.239" style="s2">design criteria is that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.670" end="00:49:54.009" style="s2">create rigorously anti rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.239" end="00:49:57.759" style="s2">environments it doesn&#39;t end up being all</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.009" end="00:50:02.170" style="s2">of it I&#39;ll do two generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.759" end="00:50:05.619" style="s2">that&#39;s one and that is what we see in</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.170" end="00:50:09.009" style="s2">terms of all of the either exponential</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.619" end="00:50:11.380" style="s2">tech risks or war risks or economic</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.009" end="00:50:13.599" style="s2">collapse leading to failed State</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.380" end="00:50:15.749" style="s2">scenario risks they all come from things</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.599" end="00:50:18.309" style="s2">like that now all of the like</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.749" end="00:50:20.799" style="s2">environmental biosphere collapse stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.309" end="00:50:23.019" style="s2">is also related to tech getting bigger</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.799" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">right as we&#39;re fishing out more fish as</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.019" end="00:50:26.200" style="s2">we&#39;re getting more co2 it also relates</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:28.569" style="s2">that but it&#39;s a slightly different thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.200" end="00:50:31.390" style="s2">that we look at here which is whether</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.569" end="00:50:32.410" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about co2 in the air or</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.390" end="00:50:35.740" style="s2">mercury</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.410" end="00:50:38.140" style="s2">in the air or the water or microplastics</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.740" end="00:50:40.420" style="s2">in the water or a continent of plastic</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.140" end="00:50:43.540" style="s2">in the ocean or nitrogen affluent in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.420" end="00:50:45.460" style="s2">river deltas or those are all toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.540" end="00:50:47.140" style="s2">dynamics those are all basically stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.460" end="00:50:49.450" style="s2">that has accumulated somewhere that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.140" end="00:50:53.050" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have right we call that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.450" end="00:50:55.450" style="s2">pollution so we don&#39;t need to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.050" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">dead zones issue or the co2 issue or</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.450" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">that we have to solve all of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:00.730" style="s2">categorically that we&#39;re not creating</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">accumulation dynamics and on the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.730" end="00:51:06.370" style="s2">side of that same coin is depletion</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:08.470" style="s2">dynamics so cutting down all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.370" end="00:51:11.470" style="s2">old-growth forests fishing out all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.470" end="00:51:14.830" style="s2">the fish species extinction biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.470" end="00:51:18.040" style="s2">loss peak nitrogen peak oil etc those</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.830" end="00:51:20.650" style="s2">are all where we are using something in</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.040" end="00:51:22.030" style="s2">a way that depletes it then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.650" end="00:51:23.320" style="s2">turned into trash or pollution on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.030" end="00:51:26.440" style="s2">other side were to accumulate somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.320" end="00:51:29.290" style="s2">so we can define toxicity formally as</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.440" end="00:51:32.230" style="s2">depletion or accumulation because of an</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.290" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">open loop in a network diagram and if</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.230" end="00:51:36.940" style="s2">the loop was closed the things wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:38.260" style="s2">accumulate they would go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.940" end="00:51:40.120" style="s2">source of where we would get something</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.260" end="00:51:42.340" style="s2">from so it wouldn&#39;t have to deplete and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.120" end="00:51:43.930" style="s2">we noticed that when we see any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.340" end="00:51:46.090" style="s2">natural system we go to an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.930" end="00:51:48.220" style="s2">whether it&#39;s of coral reef or a forest</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.090" end="00:51:50.710" style="s2">or whatever won&#39;t go to forest there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.220" end="00:51:53.310" style="s2">no trash the body of something dies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.710" end="00:51:56.020" style="s2">compost there&#39;s feces it&#39;s compost</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.310" end="00:51:57.340" style="s2">something gets cut and bleeds it</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.020" end="00:51:59.560" style="s2">processes don&#39;t matter what it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.340" end="00:52:01.000" style="s2">anything you can think about that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.560" end="00:52:02.860" style="s2">part of that environment from an</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.000" end="00:52:04.660" style="s2">evolutionary sense the environment</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.860" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">designed to be evolved to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.660" end="00:52:08.740" style="s2">process and there&#39;s also no unknowable</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:11.590" style="s2">use of anything right anything that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.740" end="00:52:13.600" style="s2">utilized is utilized in a closed-loop</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.590" end="00:52:16.300" style="s2">fashion so one of the things we see in</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.600" end="00:52:18.820" style="s2">complex systems and natural systems is</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.300" end="00:52:20.620" style="s2">comprehensive loop closure one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.820" end="00:52:23.050" style="s2">things we noticed about the human design</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.620" end="00:52:24.820" style="s2">systems is open loops everywhere the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.050" end="00:52:26.470" style="s2">materials economy itself linear</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.820" end="00:52:27.880" style="s2">materials economy that takes version</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.470" end="00:52:29.320" style="s2">stuff and turns it into trash after</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.880" end="00:52:32.170" style="s2">using it for a very short period of time</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.320" end="00:52:33.880" style="s2">is a macro open loop but there&#39;s micro</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.170" end="00:52:36.460" style="s2">open loops everywhere we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.880" end="00:52:38.290" style="s2">categorically solve that right we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.460" end="00:52:40.950" style="s2">to basically close all of those loops</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.290" end="00:52:43.600" style="s2">and another way of saying what this</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.950" end="00:52:45.730" style="s2">generator function of issues is is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.600" end="00:52:46.230" style="s2">nature the stuff that nature makes is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.730" end="00:52:48.359" style="s2">what we call</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.230" end="00:52:49.800" style="s2">complex right it&#39;s self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.359" end="00:52:51.750" style="s2">self-creating self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.800" end="00:52:56.100" style="s2">self-repairing and the stuff we make</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.750" end="00:52:58.230" style="s2">design tools is complicated it Brad</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.100" end="00:53:01.800" style="s2">right like the computer we&#39;re talking on</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.230" end="00:53:03.690" style="s2">is rad but if it got broken it would not</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.800" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">self repair and it didn&#39;t self organize</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.690" end="00:53:07.740" style="s2">it was made it was soldered whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:10.050" style="s2">made them design from the outside we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.740" end="00:53:12.090" style="s2">think about complex stuff comes about</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.050" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">through evolution complicated stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.090" end="00:53:15.900" style="s2">comes about through design two different</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:17.580" style="s2">types of creative processes with</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.900" end="00:53:21.420" style="s2">fundamentally different characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.580" end="00:53:23.160" style="s2">and complex stuff has comprehensive loop</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.420" end="00:53:24.900" style="s2">closure everywhere because it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.160" end="00:53:26.220" style="s2">external eyes something and still be</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.900" end="00:53:28.080" style="s2">selected for adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.220" end="00:53:30.930" style="s2">right the adaptiveness factors</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.080" end="00:53:32.730" style="s2">everything whereas if I&#39;m building</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.930" end="00:53:35.250" style="s2">something I might make it for one reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.730" end="00:53:36.720" style="s2">or two or three reasons but it actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.250" end="00:53:38.070" style="s2">affects a lot of other stuff but the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:39.869" style="s2">other stuff wasn&#39;t what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.070" end="00:53:41.760" style="s2">optimize for so it ends up being where</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.869" end="00:53:43.290" style="s2">externalities occur so even this</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.760" end="00:53:46.920" style="s2">computer I&#39;m talking to you on right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.290" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">was not optimized it was optimized for a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.920" end="00:53:50.670" style="s2">bunch of things so it&#39;s really cool but</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.500" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s got a backlit screen</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.670" end="00:53:53.640" style="s2">that is 2d that&#39;s at a fixed focal</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.500" end="00:53:55.530" style="s2">length from my eyes where I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.640" end="00:53:57.660" style="s2">macular degeneration from spending too</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.530" end="00:53:59.100" style="s2">many hours on it was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.660" end="00:54:00.359" style="s2">that my eye health was not one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.100" end="00:54:03.090" style="s2">things that was built to try and focus</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.359" end="00:54:05.160" style="s2">on or the fact that it&#39;s up my</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.090" end="00:54:06.300" style="s2">posture ergonomically by me looking down</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.160" end="00:54:07.800" style="s2">at the screen it wasn&#39;t one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.300" end="00:54:09.450" style="s2">things that tried to focus on or the you</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.800" end="00:54:10.710" style="s2">know a gazillion other things right what</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.450" end="00:54:12.090" style="s2">happened to the environment and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.710" end="00:54:13.830" style="s2">supply chain process of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.090" end="00:54:15.660" style="s2">metals to make hitter the making of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.830" end="00:54:16.770" style="s2">computer affected a gazillion things</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.660" end="00:54:19.530" style="s2">that were not part of its design</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.770" end="00:54:21.270" style="s2">criteria which means the making of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.530" end="00:54:23.609" style="s2">required externalizing a bunch of harm</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.270" end="00:54:25.320" style="s2">ie a bunch of open loops where it</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.609" end="00:54:27.990" style="s2">affected stuff it was not internalized</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.320" end="00:54:30.810" style="s2">to the process we can see that if a</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.990" end="00:54:32.490" style="s2">forest burns it repairs itself if a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.810" end="00:54:37.170" style="s2">house burns it does not repair itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.490" end="00:54:38.820" style="s2">and if my computer gets broken it</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.170" end="00:54:40.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fix itself but if I cut myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.820" end="00:54:42.570" style="s2">it fixes so there&#39;s this fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.800" end="00:54:45.240" style="s2">difference reason we&#39;re bringing this up</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.570" end="00:54:48.030" style="s2">is to say if for something to be anti</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.240" end="00:54:51.630" style="s2">fragile it has to be complex complexity</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.030" end="00:54:53.730" style="s2">is the defining origin of antifragility</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.630" end="00:54:55.619" style="s2">and complicated things are all</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.730" end="00:55:00.310" style="s2">ultimately fragile more or less fragile</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.619" end="00:55:04.030" style="s2">if we have a situation where complicated</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.310" end="00:55:06.710" style="s2">subsume their complex substrate then</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.030" end="00:55:07.880" style="s2">this means continue to grow right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.710" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">basically we&#39;re converting the</p>
