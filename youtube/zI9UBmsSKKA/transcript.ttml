<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:08.250" style="s2">Bret Weinstein here I&#39;m here again with</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.130" end="00:01:11.530" style="s2">dr. Heather huiying we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.250" end="00:01:14.229" style="s2">continue to explore the situation that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.530" end="00:01:16.330" style="s2">humanity finds itself in we will as</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.229" end="00:01:19.930" style="s2">always take a decidedly evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.330" end="00:01:22.180" style="s2">viewpoint a couple of pieces of business</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.930" end="00:01:25.090" style="s2">to get to before we we hit this</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.180" end="00:01:28.360" style="s2">discussion I did a live stream yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.090" end="00:01:31.630" style="s2">I was experimenting with new technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.360" end="00:01:33.340" style="s2">including super chat and I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.630" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">very distracted and I wasn&#39;t happy with</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.340" end="00:01:37.180" style="s2">the product so I&#39;m gonna do a non live</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:39.509" style="s2">version of it and I will upload that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.180" end="00:01:43.090" style="s2">that people have access to the content</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.509" end="00:01:44.920" style="s2">from the perspective of streams going</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.090" end="00:01:46.810" style="s2">forward what we&#39;re going to do is we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.920" end="00:01:48.430" style="s2">going to hold the Super chats until the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.810" end="00:01:51.399" style="s2">end and then we will address the good</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.430" end="00:01:52.630" style="s2">super trad questions at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.399" end="00:01:54.700" style="s2">the dialogue but we&#39;re not gonna let it</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.630" end="00:01:56.350" style="s2">interrupt what we&#39;re talking about which</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.700" end="00:01:57.960" style="s2">is good for us because we won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.350" end="00:02:00.310" style="s2">distracted and it&#39;s good for you because</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.960" end="00:02:02.110" style="s2">you won&#39;t find the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.310" end="00:02:05.069" style="s2">interested in listening to disrupted by</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.110" end="00:02:08.500" style="s2">questions that are farther afield</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.069" end="00:02:11.319" style="s2">alright without further ado dr. Heather</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.500" end="00:02:13.390" style="s2">Hynes shall we start a further</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.319" end="00:02:15.400" style="s2">discussion of the corona virus and its</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.390" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">effects on humanity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.400" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">let&#39;s do it all right we had said last</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">time that we were going to move into</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:23.650" style="s2">talking about effects on society more</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:25.780" style="s2">broadly we also have a couple of points</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.650" end="00:02:28.150" style="s2">that are more strictly biological we</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.780" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">want to speak to and this may not be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.150" end="00:02:33.370" style="s2">time that we launch into an explanation</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:35.830" style="s2">of what the fourth frontier</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.370" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">slash game B is oh there&#39;s certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.830" end="00:02:38.709" style="s2">lot of interest in that probably not</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:41.340" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.709" end="00:02:44.440" style="s2">but we do hope to do this maybe weekly</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">from now on so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.440" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">getting there so you want to start with</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:50.200" style="s2">the society level stuff or or tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:50.739" style="s2">couple things over in biology space</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.200" end="00:02:52.420" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.739" end="00:02:53.530" style="s2">well I&#39;m realizing actually seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.420" end="00:02:56.500" style="s2">monitor that there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.530" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">certain amount of jeering at the bandana</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.500" end="00:03:00.220" style="s2">that I&#39;m wearing so for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.510" style="s2">were not paying attention to the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.220" end="00:03:03.849" style="s2">live stream I should just say that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.510" end="00:03:06.340" style="s2">is an epidemiological measure and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.849" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">not that I just like having an excuse to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.340" end="00:03:09.349" style="s2">dress like a cowboy but the the point of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">the band</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.349" end="00:03:13.159" style="s2">is that I put it on in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.030" end="00:03:14.989" style="s2">then I use it as needed how effective it</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.159" end="00:03:17.799" style="s2">is that&#39;s another question you will see</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.989" end="00:03:19.249" style="s2">that in the piece I&#39;m going to upload</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.799" end="00:03:20.749" style="s2">later on</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.249" end="00:03:22.389" style="s2">well the question has been raised as to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.749" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">whether or not you dress like a cowboy a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.389" end="00:03:29.239" style="s2">or a golden retriever or both</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:31.129" style="s2">you know perhaps about the best Cowboys</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.239" end="00:03:33.349" style="s2">have a touch of golden retriever to them</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.129" end="00:03:33.950" style="s2">so anyway you Chaminda take it as you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.349" end="00:03:36.169" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.950" end="00:03:37.790" style="s2">well me let&#39;s let&#39;s just tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.169" end="00:03:44.209" style="s2">couple points in biology first before we</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.790" end="00:03:45.590" style="s2">before we hit Society level stuff given</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.209" end="00:03:47.870" style="s2">that maybe we won&#39;t we won&#39;t start by</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.590" end="00:03:49.579" style="s2">showing you the phylogeny of what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.870" end="00:03:51.799" style="s2">understand about coronaviruses although</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.579" end="00:03:53.060" style="s2">that that scientific literature is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.799" end="00:03:57.799" style="s2">somewhat interesting there&#39;s a decent</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.060" end="00:04:00.379" style="s2">paper published from 2018 on that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.799" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">prompted by both SARS one this being</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.379" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">what we&#39;re living through right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:06.650" style="s2">being SARS too and MERS is it the one</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:09.310" style="s2">that comes out of Saudi Arabia and gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.650" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">transmitted through by camels to humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.310" end="00:04:14.419" style="s2">and now people are trying to plug in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:16.729" style="s2">basically the molecular phylogenetics</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.419" end="00:04:21.169" style="s2">you work on viruses are trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.729" end="00:04:22.610" style="s2">out where SARS to fits into this and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.169" end="00:04:23.900" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s interesting for</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.610" end="00:04:25.729" style="s2">those of us who like to geek out on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.900" end="00:04:27.889" style="s2">sort of thing can I just say if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.729" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">watching in Saudi Arabia please put a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.889" end="00:04:31.610" style="s2">mask on your camera yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:33.229" style="s2">definitely good because the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.610" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">we need right now is another corona</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.229" end="00:04:40.130" style="s2">virus outbreak of a different sort say</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:41.990" style="s2">so okay how about let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.130" end="00:04:43.639" style="s2">likelihood of three three points over in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.990" end="00:04:46.070" style="s2">biology space the likelihood of vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.639" end="00:04:49.789" style="s2">the likelihood that this turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.070" end="00:04:52.550" style="s2">have a seasonal seasonal manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.789" end="00:04:53.960" style="s2">such as it will dip in the summer as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.550" end="00:04:56.599" style="s2">know from flu viruses which are a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.960" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2">different kind of virus and density</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.599" end="00:05:00.919" style="s2">dependence of of this which will explain</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:03.229" style="s2">when we get there I&#39;m gonna start with</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.919" end="00:05:05.090" style="s2">likelihood of vaccine yeah by the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.229" end="00:05:06.979" style="s2">it&#39;s a beautiful list of topics it could</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.090" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">well take up many hours but indeed a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.979" end="00:05:13.639" style="s2">first pass on them so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:16.370" style="s2">hopefulness about vaccine emerging and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.639" end="00:05:18.380" style="s2">there is a lot seeming to be banked on</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.370" end="00:05:21.110" style="s2">the fact that a vaccine is somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.380" end="00:05:22.700" style="s2">near nearby around the corner</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.110" end="00:05:24.530" style="s2">and so if we can just hold out long</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.700" end="00:05:27.920" style="s2">enough flatten the curve keep the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.530" end="00:05:29.510" style="s2">medical machinery humming then we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.920" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">make it to a vaccine at which point life</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.510" end="00:05:33.740" style="s2">goes back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:35.720" style="s2">personally let me say I suspect life</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.740" end="00:05:37.370" style="s2">never goes back to normal we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.720" end="00:05:39.380" style="s2">gonna live in quarantine from here on</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.370" end="00:05:42.230" style="s2">out but I think humanity just learned a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.380" end="00:05:43.970" style="s2">very serious lesson about something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.230" end="00:05:47.050" style="s2">will be much harder to control than we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.970" end="00:05:50.590" style="s2">imagined will there be a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.050" end="00:05:53.660" style="s2">obviously we don&#39;t know but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.590" end="00:05:56.060" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a vaccine that works for</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.660" end="00:05:58.280" style="s2">the flu in the sense of banishing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.060" end="00:06:01.370" style="s2">permanently the way we do with smallpox</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.280" end="00:06:05.000" style="s2">polio even chickenpox and things like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.370" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">that so the question about why anyone is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.000" end="00:06:09.710" style="s2">confident that we will have a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">that is both effective and safe and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.710" end="00:06:12.770" style="s2">we can get there in the short term when</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:15.140" style="s2">obviously there is a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.770" end="00:06:17.240" style="s2">money to be made simply banishing colds</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.140" end="00:06:20.030" style="s2">and flu and we&#39;ve failed at that so far</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.240" end="00:06:22.280" style="s2">I would say the likelihood that we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.030" end="00:06:24.650" style="s2">something that allows us to manage it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.280" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">fairly high I don&#39;t know on what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.650" end="00:06:29.210" style="s2">timescale but the likelihood that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:31.190" style="s2">just simply banish kovat 19 from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.210" end="00:06:34.280" style="s2">face of the earth with a vaccine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.190" end="00:06:37.010" style="s2">effective and safe and soon seems highly</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.280" end="00:06:38.900" style="s2">unlikely one reason that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.010" end="00:06:41.270" style="s2">unlikely is that this is a retrovirus</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.900" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">and a retrovirus means that instead of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.270" end="00:06:46.640" style="s2">the information and remember of virus is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.940" end="00:06:49.910" style="s2">really just two things its information</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.640" end="00:06:53.450" style="s2">and a basically self-deploying robotic</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.010" end="00:07:07.730" style="s2">of the virus is the machinery of the</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.950" end="00:07:14.200" style="s2">very little to attack in a virus and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.700" style="s2">the case of a retrovirus where the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.200" end="00:07:18.680" style="s2">information is encoded in RNA rather</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.700" end="00:07:20.630" style="s2">than DNA which you may remember from</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.680" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">your biology course in high school or</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.630" end="00:07:25.430" style="s2">college is that RNA unlike DNA is</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:28.610" style="s2">single-stranded and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.430" end="00:07:29.810" style="s2">single-stranded now this is a story we</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.610" end="00:07:31.760" style="s2">tell ourselves but because of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.810" end="00:07:33.350" style="s2">single-stranded the mutation rate is</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.760" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">much higher which means that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.350" end="00:07:37.340" style="s2">morphs it</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:39.380" style="s2">shapeshifter and building a vaccine that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.340" end="00:07:42.350" style="s2">causes the immune system to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.380" end="00:07:44.330" style="s2">the pathogen is difficult if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.350" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">pathogen is always changing shape</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.330" end="00:07:49.820" style="s2">can I just add why single-stranded RNA</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.770" style="s2">versus double-stranded DNA should have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.820" end="00:07:53.810" style="s2">higher mutation rate is it the double</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.770" end="00:07:56.480" style="s2">stranded nature of DNA is effectively an</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.810" end="00:07:58.460" style="s2">error correction mechanism so RNA can</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.480" end="00:08:00.740" style="s2">change without there being anything to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.460" end="00:08:04.040" style="s2">correct it that&#39;s true that the part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.740" end="00:08:06.110" style="s2">the story that makes me hesitant is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.040" end="00:08:08.780" style="s2">this looks very much like a feature and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.110" end="00:08:12.070" style="s2">not a bug and so even the frame the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.780" end="00:08:15.370" style="s2">phrase error correction suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.070" end="00:08:17.960" style="s2">the retroviruses are benefiting from</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.370" end="00:08:21.140" style="s2">some sort of an accident rather than an</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.960" end="00:08:24.140" style="s2">adaptive process so in any case that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.140" end="00:08:28.220" style="s2">probably too deep in the weeds but these</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.140" end="00:08:30.590" style="s2">viruses that we are facing are highly</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.220" end="00:08:33.110" style="s2">effective clearly at spreading they have</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.590" end="00:08:35.840" style="s2">two characteristics that make this one</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.110" end="00:08:39.950" style="s2">particularly ferocious one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.840" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">characteristics is the long time period</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.950" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">with which the viruses can persist on</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:48.290" style="s2">surfaces and the other is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.140" end="00:08:49.910" style="s2">asymptomatic stage in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.290" end="00:08:51.650" style="s2">apparently spreading the disease those</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.910" end="00:08:56.860" style="s2">two things make this thing spread like</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.650" end="00:09:00.740" style="s2">wildfire the vaccine would be lovely but</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.860" end="00:09:02.270" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be very hard to create one</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.740" end="00:09:04.340" style="s2">I mean notice we also don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.270" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">vaccine for HIV which is another</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.340" end="00:09:09.380" style="s2">retrovirus despite the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:11.330" style="s2">would be a huge boon to humanity and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.380" end="00:09:13.130" style="s2">huge financial win for whoever came up</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.330" end="00:09:14.780" style="s2">with the vaccine so there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.130" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">pressure to get one and yet we still</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.780" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have one decades down the road</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:22.340" style="s2">with respect to HIV this is not to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:25.880" style="s2">that there can&#39;t be a virus of course a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.340" end="00:09:28.930" style="s2">vaccine of course but the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.880" end="00:09:31.040" style="s2">anyone any government or any individuals</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.930" end="00:09:32.510" style="s2">hospitals or healthcare systems are</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.040" end="00:09:34.220" style="s2">pinning all their hopes on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.510" end="00:09:36.170" style="s2">development of vaccine seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">short-sighted obviously there should</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.170" end="00:09:41.690" style="s2">always be plans B through Z in place and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.490" style="s2">in this case it&#39;s not clear to us not as</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.690" end="00:09:44.900" style="s2">virologists because we&#39;re not Nora&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.490" end="00:09:46.610" style="s2">medical doctors because we&#39;re not but as</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.900" end="00:09:48.110" style="s2">evolutionary biologists which we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.610" end="00:09:50.350" style="s2">that a vaccine is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.110" end="00:09:53.870" style="s2">most likely way to that we will end up</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.350" end="00:09:55.880" style="s2">treating treating this virus for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.870" end="00:09:58.610" style="s2">good of all humanity so we really have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.880" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">two levels of question with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.610" end="00:10:02.360" style="s2">the situation one is what the hell do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">do now that this thing is loose and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.360" end="00:10:08.029" style="s2">nearly global and the other is what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:12.380" style="s2">the lesson so that this never happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.029" end="00:10:16.190" style="s2">again and frankly the second of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.380" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">questions is a lot more tractable right</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.190" end="00:10:20.329" style="s2">we may simply be stuck with ghovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">for a goodly long time and we may learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.329" end="00:10:25.910" style="s2">to manage it the way we now manage HIV</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:28.490" style="s2">which it&#39;s a big cost to the system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.910" end="00:10:30.260" style="s2">it&#39;s terrible for people who get it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.490" end="00:10:33.110" style="s2">have to be on drugs for their whole life</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.260" end="00:10:34.970" style="s2">but nonetheless it is successfully</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.110" end="00:10:37.490" style="s2">managed in a way that it wasn&#39;t - in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.970" end="00:10:43.130" style="s2">three decades ago yeah and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.490" end="00:10:46.519" style="s2">like HIV this is a zoonotic infection so</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.130" end="00:10:49.850" style="s2">donek pathogen and these zone notic</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.519" end="00:10:52.040" style="s2">pathogens will continue to emerge we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.850" end="00:10:53.990" style="s2">do things at the societal level and at</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.040" end="00:10:56.750" style="s2">the cultural level to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.990" end="00:10:58.190" style="s2">likelihood that they do emerge and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.750" end="00:11:00.860" style="s2">know in the case of corona viruses which</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.190" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">HIV is not I don&#39;t think I actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think so but but this</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:10.760" style="s2">is and several others are these they</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:13.370" style="s2">seem to be from one of several species</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.760" end="00:11:15.800" style="s2">of bats as Brett addressed last time but</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:19.370" style="s2">then they live in civets</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.800" end="00:11:21.160" style="s2">or camels or maybe pangolins and so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.370" end="00:11:25.339" style="s2">know what is it that we can do to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.160" end="00:11:27.199" style="s2">the emergence of novel so knotek&#39;s into</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.339" end="00:11:30.890" style="s2">humans it&#39;s not that these viruses</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.890" end="00:11:33.709" style="s2">species for the most part sometimes</p>

<p begin="00:11:36.500" end="00:11:40.760" style="s2">of years they&#39;ve been but the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.449" end="00:11:43.579" style="s2">they emerge into humans and are then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.760" end="00:11:45.800" style="s2">relationship with us is brand-new and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.579" end="00:11:48.860" style="s2">this is part of what is making this so</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.800" end="00:11:50.449" style="s2">virulent that we we all of us are naive</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.860" end="00:11:52.550" style="s2">with regard to our immune systems and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.449" end="00:11:55.100" style="s2">their ability to recognize this or at</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.550" end="00:11:58.850" style="s2">least we were six months ago this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.100" end="00:12:01.410" style="s2">quite true I do want to stop at this</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.850" end="00:12:04.470" style="s2">point and just say number</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.410" end="00:12:07.319" style="s2">one thing on my list for preventing this</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.470" end="00:12:09.959" style="s2">from ever happening again would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.319" end="00:12:10.980" style="s2">taking all of the steps necessary so</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.959" end="00:12:14.250" style="s2">that bush meat</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.980" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">is no longer eaten anywhere on earth and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.250" end="00:12:18.470" style="s2">if that seems extreme to you if that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:21.750" style="s2">sounds like that&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.470" end="00:12:24.019" style="s2">far-reaching consequences consider the</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.779" end="00:12:58.860" style="s2">that aids there&#39;s a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.730" end="00:13:01.379" style="s2">exotic meat and bush meat though so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.860" end="00:13:04.589" style="s2">think we do need to to play that line</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.379" end="00:13:06.149" style="s2">very carefully go on well I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.149" end="00:13:11.819" style="s2">honest with you people certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.209" end="00:13:14.970" style="s2">generally eat microbat right there are</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.480" end="00:13:44.990" style="s2">this did come through a wet market but</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.110" end="00:13:49.079" style="s2">let me just say we also believe that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.990" end="00:13:52.860" style="s2">aids emerged from traffic in chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.079" end="00:13:56.699" style="s2">meat now a bola too may be quite likely</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.860" end="00:13:58.649" style="s2">yeah so nobody should be eating great</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.699" end="00:14:01.559" style="s2">apes for lots of different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.649" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">there&#39;s every reason to conserve them</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.559" end="00:14:05.850" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean to fault the people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:09.059" style="s2">are doing the eating or the hunting</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.850" end="00:14:10.860" style="s2">although some of them probably deserve a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.059" end="00:14:12.940" style="s2">certain amount of blame other people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.860" end="00:14:14.830" style="s2">doing this out of desperation or out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.940" end="00:14:17.260" style="s2">a simple lack of economic opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.830" end="00:14:18.790" style="s2">so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to place blame</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.260" end="00:14:22.690" style="s2">but let me just say that from the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.790" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">of view of humanity&#39;s well-being the</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.210" end="00:14:42.370" style="s2">something like 32 million people have</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.370" end="00:14:49.540" style="s2">know a death toll that&#39;s I believe above</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.150" end="00:15:18.010" style="s2">emerging every few decades so it&#39;s time</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.010" end="00:15:21.820" style="s2">means providing the opportunities that</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.020" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">because we&#39;re very popular in the exotic</p>

<p begin="00:19:42.940" end="00:19:51.370" style="s2">the Irani are the indigenous hunters and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.490" end="00:19:54.100" style="s2">the the place that we were was extremely</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.330" end="00:20:21.540" style="s2">are uncontacted but there is a flow of</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.990" end="00:20:43.390" style="s2">there is any access at all to firearms</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.600" end="00:20:46.390" style="s2">and metal canoes the fauna the large</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.390" end="00:20:49.630" style="s2">fauna crashes as a result of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.390" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">that a tiny number of people using MA</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.630" end="00:20:55.000" style="s2">technology can hunt those places out</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.000" end="00:20:57.220" style="s2">whereas using ancient technology there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.000" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">a natural balance they hunt at a rate it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.220" end="00:21:00.670" style="s2">depletes the populations but the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:03.030" style="s2">populations are capable of rebuilding</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.670" end="00:21:06.070" style="s2">and you have an equilibrium there so</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.030" end="00:21:09.190" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s we&#39;re not claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.070" end="00:21:10.600" style="s2">the Huaorani are trying to do the best</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.600" end="00:21:17.350" style="s2">is not a savage noble a noble savage</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.240" end="00:21:19.180" style="s2">story right it is simply the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.350" end="00:21:21.970" style="s2">these technologies that they have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.180" end="00:21:26.380" style="s2">using for thousands of years persisted</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.970" end="00:21:27.940" style="s2">in part because they allowed their them</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.380" end="00:21:28.570" style="s2">and their prey to be in equilibrium with</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.940" end="00:21:30.340" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.570" end="00:21:31.690" style="s2">those technologies that wiped out their</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.340" end="00:21:33.400" style="s2">prey well that prey is no longer there</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.690" end="00:21:35.710" style="s2">we don&#39;t see it anymore yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.400" end="00:21:37.000" style="s2">test of time similarly but here here</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.710" end="00:21:41.140" style="s2">would be my point let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.000" end="00:21:44.830" style="s2">an uncontacted tribe functioning in an</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.140" end="00:21:49.240" style="s2">ancestral way but the effect of firearms</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.830" end="00:21:52.750" style="s2">roads motorized canoes begins to deplete</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.240" end="00:21:55.270" style="s2">the fauna from their habitat which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.750" end="00:21:56.980" style="s2">highly likely they are likely to branch</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.270" end="00:21:59.560" style="s2">out and start hunting things that would</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.980" end="00:22:02.920" style="s2">not be typical for them and so even they</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.560" end="00:22:05.860" style="s2">may end up bringing one of these novel</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.920" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">viruses to our doorstep by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.860" end="00:22:10.030" style="s2">effects that they had no control over</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:11.260" style="s2">and weren&#39;t even aware of just the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.030" end="00:22:13.450" style="s2">simple fact of something that was</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.450" end="00:22:17.710" style="s2">them to branch out so we really have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.820" end="00:22:19.420" style="s2">start thinking more holistically about</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.710" end="00:22:23.170" style="s2">why we are encountering these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.420" end="00:22:26.500" style="s2">what happens when one emerges and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.170" end="00:22:28.420" style="s2">finally ultimately what we do now that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.500" end="00:22:34.330" style="s2">we have one on the loose that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.420" end="00:22:36.580" style="s2">be quite devastating yeah good so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.330" end="00:22:39.490" style="s2">know that the flu tends to be seasonal</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.580" end="00:22:41.310" style="s2">yes right you don&#39;t you don&#39;t hear about</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.490" end="00:22:44.380" style="s2">people getting flu in the summer and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.310" end="00:22:48.130" style="s2">because of the tilt of our planet</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.380" end="00:22:50.140" style="s2">and and seasonality that means that when</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.130" end="00:22:52.330" style="s2">it&#39;s our flu season it&#39;s not Australia&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.140" end="00:22:55.540" style="s2">flu season for instance what are the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.330" end="00:22:58.360" style="s2">chances that as has been widely hoped</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.540" end="00:22:59.190" style="s2">and again touted as the thing that will</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.360" end="00:23:03.010" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.190" end="00:23:06.220" style="s2">what are the chances that this Tsarskoe</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.010" end="00:23:07.870" style="s2">of two is going to be seasonal in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.220" end="00:23:09.850" style="s2">first season that we&#39;ve run into it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.870" end="00:23:12.370" style="s2">this in this first northern summer which</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.850" end="00:23:14.500" style="s2">is approaching what are the chances that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.370" end="00:23:17.860" style="s2">will already have a seasonal cyclicity</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.500" end="00:23:20.410" style="s2">and go underground for at least a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.860" end="00:23:22.630" style="s2">months so this is another place where</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.410" end="00:23:24.460" style="s2">I&#39;m dubious of people&#39;s expectations</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.630" end="00:23:27.910" style="s2">because I think they&#39;re simply not</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.460" end="00:23:30.040" style="s2">thinking in an evolutionary form there</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.910" end="00:23:33.870" style="s2">is one way in which it is highly likely</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.040" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">that we will see seasonality and that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.870" end="00:23:39.490" style="s2">the conditions outside do not appear to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:41.860" style="s2">be conducive to the spread and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.490" end="00:23:43.210" style="s2">persistence of this virus so to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.860" end="00:23:45.880" style="s2">extent that people spend more time</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.210" end="00:23:47.740" style="s2">outside when the weather is nice the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.880" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">virus gets exposed to UV light which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.740" end="00:23:51.940" style="s2">highly destructive of it we&#39;re liable to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:54.490" style="s2">see some change in how it gets</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.940" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">transmitted during that period sorry but</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.490" end="00:23:59.560" style="s2">you feel like being highly destructive</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:01.390" style="s2">of it and high temperatures being highly</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.560" end="00:24:02.650" style="s2">destructive of it we don&#39;t want to mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.390" end="00:24:04.750" style="s2">to suggest that you should be sticking</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.650" end="00:24:06.070" style="s2">UV lights up your nose any more than you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.750" end="00:24:08.560" style="s2">should be sticking hair dryers up your</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.070" end="00:24:10.690" style="s2">nose this is not going to help yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.560" end="00:24:13.480" style="s2">just say no and it also it&#39;ll it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.690" end="00:24:16.420" style="s2">drive off potential mates so ah you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.480" end="00:24:18.340" style="s2">lots of reasons not to do it but okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.420" end="00:24:20.530" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing about flu and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.340" end="00:24:22.390" style="s2">reaching deep bleep back into my</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.530" end="00:24:25.900" style="s2">education here so if there&#39;s new data</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.390" end="00:24:27.670" style="s2">I&#39;m unaware of please let me know in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.900" end="00:24:31.300" style="s2">some way or other and I&#39;ll update my</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.670" end="00:24:34.840" style="s2">model but some years ago I ran into</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.300" end="00:24:36.430" style="s2">evidence that the flu had actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.840" end="00:24:39.430" style="s2">always been seasonal apparently but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.430" end="00:24:43.330" style="s2">switched seasons and the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.430" end="00:24:46.390" style="s2">likely that human behavior shifted and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.330" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">so it was true that people imagined</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.390" end="00:24:50.530" style="s2">people on the American frontier for</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:52.330" style="s2">example on the American frontier during</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.530" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">the winter you might be hunkered down</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.330" end="00:24:56.380" style="s2">you&#39;re not farming right you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:58.090" style="s2">trying to persist through the winter on</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.380" end="00:24:59.920" style="s2">your stored roots and grains and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.090" end="00:25:02.050" style="s2">whatever you might have and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.920" end="00:25:03.700" style="s2">spending a lot of time in town</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.050" end="00:25:05.260" style="s2">interacting with other people so from</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.700" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">the point of view of a virus it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.260" end="00:25:09.730" style="s2">very good time to try to spread right</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:11.890" style="s2">it&#39;s effectively social distancing right</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.730" end="00:25:13.029" style="s2">but bye-bye culture rather than by dicta</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.890" end="00:25:15.100" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.029" end="00:25:16.809" style="s2">it&#39;s ecological social distancing at</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.100" end="00:25:20.230" style="s2">some level though the weather forces you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.809" end="00:25:22.600" style="s2">into a kind of hiding and then when</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.230" end="00:25:24.190" style="s2">people went into town that was a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.600" end="00:25:25.299" style="s2">time for a virus to move from one house</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.190" end="00:25:27.460" style="s2">to the next because people were</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.299" end="00:25:31.149" style="s2">interacting it you know the hardware</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.460" end="00:25:34.059" style="s2">store and everywhere else okay but then</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.149" end="00:25:36.299" style="s2">life changed and fossil fuels happened</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.059" end="00:25:39.580" style="s2">or whatever it was that caused people to</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.299" end="00:25:41.259" style="s2">be spending more time inside together</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.580" end="00:25:43.059" style="s2">during the winter you know imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.259" end="00:25:45.429" style="s2">classroom full of people gathered</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.059" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">studiously working away during the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.429" end="00:25:49.059" style="s2">winter coughing on each other or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:50.619" style="s2">HVAC system transporting it around</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.059" end="00:25:53.320" style="s2">whatever the things are that caused</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.619" end="00:25:55.990" style="s2">people to concentrate during the winter</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.320" end="00:25:58.779" style="s2">in a social form seems to have caused</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.990" end="00:26:03.460" style="s2">the flu to move from a summer seasonal</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.779" end="00:26:06.429" style="s2">to a winter seasonal for for humans now</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.460" end="00:26:08.169" style="s2">again I don&#39;t know how true that story</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.429" end="00:26:10.419" style="s2">remains but let&#39;s just say that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.169" end="00:26:13.629" style="s2">contains a bit of truth which is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.419" end="00:26:18.039" style="s2">these viruses what they contain in their</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.629" end="00:26:22.059" style="s2">little strip of RNA or DNA is a message</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.039" end="00:26:24.279" style="s2">that is built by selection to get this</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.059" end="00:26:25.720" style="s2">object deeply into the future that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.279" end="00:26:30.990" style="s2">what all creatures are trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.720" end="00:26:35.220" style="s2">including viruses so having a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.990" end="00:26:37.749" style="s2">informational packet that causes them to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.220" end="00:26:40.629" style="s2">behave in a way that makes them more</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.749" end="00:26:43.240" style="s2">likely to be transmitted is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.629" end="00:26:46.659" style="s2">what is being favored but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.240" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">kicker because this virus is brand-new</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.659" end="00:26:53.139" style="s2">to humanity there is no reason to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">that it has a message that&#39;s fine-tuned</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.139" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">about our seasonal behavior so even if</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:01.019" style="s2">it is seasonal in the bat it came from</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:03.519" style="s2">if that&#39;s where it came from that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.019" end="00:27:05.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it will have a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.519" end="00:27:07.269" style="s2">message with respect to seasonality when</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.830" end="00:27:08.649" style="s2">it gets into ourselves for one things</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.269" end="00:27:10.289" style="s2">our genomes are different and for</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.649" end="00:27:12.759" style="s2">another thing that the physiological</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.289" end="00:27:14.259" style="s2">triggers and the behavior of the seasons</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.259" end="00:27:19.450" style="s2">for a third thing this is spread so</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.809" end="00:27:21.759" style="s2">quickly so globally that it is run into</p>

<p begin="00:27:21.759" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">weather and population densities so</p>

<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:30.730" style="s2">for the virus imagining that what</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.990" end="00:27:32.529" style="s2">adaptive means again is that it can get</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.149" end="00:27:41.110" style="s2">will be different in different places</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.110" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">different places now the difficult part</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.269" end="00:27:48.669" style="s2">in order to think about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:52.570" style="s2">evolutionarily the difficult part is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.669" end="00:27:53.380" style="s2">understand that almost every line is a</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.380" end="00:27:58.330" style="s2">right all the kovat 19 that people have</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.330" end="00:28:03.490" style="s2">person to person but then that line will</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.519" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">peter out there&#39;s variation in those</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.490" end="00:28:09.669" style="s2">lines and some line will prove to have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:15.009" style="s2">brilliant insight about how to get from</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.009" end="00:28:19.120" style="s2">novel writing kind of guy but in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:21.340" style="s2">I had the outline for a novel at one</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.120" end="00:28:27.519" style="s2">point about a virus that was spread by</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.340" end="00:28:29.789" style="s2">Amazon I service right by the service</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.519" end="00:28:32.830" style="s2">and the idea was that what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.789" end="00:28:35.470" style="s2">basically a vector service and that a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.830" end="00:28:38.350" style="s2">virus that could be transmitted on boxes</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.470" end="00:28:40.179" style="s2">and you know especially you know using</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.350" end="00:28:42.970" style="s2">the return service you know you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.179" end="00:28:45.159" style="s2">scaring people I&#39;m scaring people and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.970" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">the folks at Amazon are calling up legal</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.159" end="00:28:48.490" style="s2">seeing whether I&#39;ve said something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:51.519" style="s2">could I don&#39;t know have me banished from</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.490" end="00:28:54.519" style="s2">the earth I guess but just just to flag</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.519" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">this we did point briefly last time to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.519" end="00:28:58.990" style="s2">the idea that the virus can live on</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.860" end="00:29:02.379" style="s2">cardboard for up to 24 hours apparently</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.990" end="00:29:04.659" style="s2">so one one might if you can wait another</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.379" end="00:29:06.360" style="s2">24 hours after getting your Amazon boxes</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.659" end="00:29:08.740" style="s2">even though it may be one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.360" end="00:29:10.899" style="s2">inputs from the outside world at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.740" end="00:29:13.269" style="s2">moment in your life just waiting for 24</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.899" end="00:29:14.470" style="s2">hours probably renders any remaining</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.269" end="00:29:17.350" style="s2">virus that could have been on those</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.470" end="00:29:19.269" style="s2">boxes inactive well okay I want to come</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.350" end="00:29:23.769" style="s2">back to the point I was headed towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.269" end="00:29:26.230" style="s2">but I would say just think okay think</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.769" end="00:29:28.330" style="s2">about the object you&#39;re looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.230" end="00:29:30.299" style="s2">long it&#39;s been since human hands touched</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.330" end="00:29:31.450" style="s2">it imagine that the person who touched</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.299" end="00:29:33.789" style="s2">coffee</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.450" end="00:29:35.409" style="s2">we&#39;re coughed right something right the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.789" end="00:29:38.919" style="s2">outer box was touched</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.409" end="00:29:39.730" style="s2">within days maybe hours right the inner</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.919" end="00:29:41.380" style="s2">box was</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.730" end="00:29:43.570" style="s2">probably touched in that same period</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.380" end="00:29:46.270" style="s2">inside the inner box has probably been</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.570" end="00:29:49.570" style="s2">months since anybody could possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.270" end="00:29:50.860" style="s2">touched it so you know the way to deal</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.570" end="00:29:53.680" style="s2">with these things the way we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.860" end="00:29:56.560" style="s2">with it something arrives we take it</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.680" end="00:29:58.780" style="s2">immediately to the garage we take the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.560" end="00:30:00.160" style="s2">thing out of the box we let the boxes</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.780" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2">sit somewhere where we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.160" end="00:30:03.610" style="s2">interacting with them after we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:05.770" style="s2">extracted the stuff we wash our hands</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.610" end="00:30:07.270" style="s2">and then we can pretty much imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.770" end="00:30:09.910" style="s2">the stuff from the inside of the box is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.270" end="00:30:13.300" style="s2">not likely to have anything contagious</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.910" end="00:30:15.130" style="s2">on it but anyway the larger point was</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.300" end="00:30:16.900" style="s2">okay something could figure out that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.130" end="00:30:20.200" style="s2">Amazon is how we&#39;re getting our stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.900" end="00:30:21.490" style="s2">right and it could use Amazon to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.200" end="00:30:23.470" style="s2">from one place to another that would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.490" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">truly frightening we can block that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.470" end="00:30:27.430" style="s2">Avenue by dealing really carefully with</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:29.980" style="s2">the stuff that is transmitted and I must</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.430" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">say before you sue me Jeff Bezos I</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.980" end="00:30:35.410" style="s2">should say we&#39;re not where is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:38.110" style="s2">Amazon is both a potential hazard here</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.410" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">as a vector or if it behaves itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.110" end="00:30:41.560" style="s2">a potential solution because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:44.590" style="s2">actually facilitating social isolation</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.560" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">without creating dire consequences so</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.590" end="00:30:51.160" style="s2">one of the things that I know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:53.560" style="s2">be thinking about is how to be faster</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.160" end="00:30:56.020" style="s2">acting and more deliberate when we shut</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.560" end="00:30:58.150" style="s2">stuff down to protect ourselves and more</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.020" end="00:31:00.100" style="s2">surgical so we don&#39;t shut down the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.150" end="00:31:01.900" style="s2">that actually keeps us functional</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.100" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">because we&#39;re now created we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.900" end="00:31:06.160" style="s2">set a timer with respect to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:09.400" style="s2">psychology yes right where they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.160" end="00:31:12.730" style="s2">gonna get antsy and that&#39;s gonna create</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.400" end="00:31:14.440" style="s2">bad effects and a lot of things could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.730" end="00:31:16.180" style="s2">better managed so that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.440" end="00:31:19.930" style="s2">great segue to talking about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.180" end="00:31:23.170" style="s2">society level stuff but let&#39;s first talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.930" end="00:31:26.440" style="s2">just a little bit about the apparent</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.170" end="00:31:30.040" style="s2">density dependence of both the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.440" end="00:31:33.520" style="s2">likelihood of infection from SARS Cove 2</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.040" end="00:31:35.800" style="s2">and the seriousness of the disease so</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.520" end="00:31:37.960" style="s2">from the perspective of and so we I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.800" end="00:31:39.370" style="s2">think we just have anecdotal I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.960" end="00:31:42.220" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen the statistical analysis</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.370" end="00:31:44.890" style="s2">yet of this but health care workers seem</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.220" end="00:31:48.420" style="s2">to be getting sick at a much higher rate</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.890" end="00:31:53.030" style="s2">than the general population and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.420" end="00:31:54.380" style="s2">speaks to density dependence of exposure</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.030" end="00:31:55.880" style="s2">increasing the likelihood that you will</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.380" end="00:31:56.770" style="s2">get sick this is pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.880" end="00:32:00.140" style="s2">understand from a statistical</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.770" end="00:32:02.690" style="s2">perspective just that you are you you</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.140" end="00:32:04.790" style="s2">exposed to more virus over more time</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.690" end="00:32:06.470" style="s2">it&#39;s more likely that you will make a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.790" end="00:32:08.180" style="s2">mistake and that you will end up in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.470" end="00:32:10.280" style="s2">it right so that&#39;s this that&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.180" end="00:32:11.540" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing surprising if that part</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.280" end="00:32:15.580" style="s2">straight part that part is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.540" end="00:32:17.990" style="s2">straightforward the second aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.580" end="00:32:20.300" style="s2">apparent density dependence is more spry</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.990" end="00:32:22.670" style="s2">surprising harder to explain at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.300" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">mechanistic level but something that if</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.670" end="00:32:26.030" style="s2">we recognize even if we can&#39;t explain it</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:27.920" style="s2">in terms of what the mechanism is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.030" end="00:32:30.140" style="s2">driving it can tell us something about</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.920" end="00:32:32.930" style="s2">how we should be behaving which is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.140" end="00:32:35.300" style="s2">health care workers also seem when they</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.930" end="00:32:37.040" style="s2">do get sick to be getting sicker they</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.300" end="00:32:38.180" style="s2">are even very you know very healthy</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.040" end="00:32:40.490" style="s2">people health care workers in general</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.180" end="00:32:41.810" style="s2">are healthy people who are doing their</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.490" end="00:32:43.640" style="s2">jobs and when they&#39;re coming down with</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.810" end="00:32:46.550" style="s2">that they seem to be again anecdotal but</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.640" end="00:32:49.730" style="s2">they seem to be getting far sicker than</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.550" end="00:32:51.350" style="s2">you know comparable people age-matched</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.730" end="00:32:54.740" style="s2">health condition match before they got</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.350" end="00:33:00.410" style="s2">sick in in gen-pop in the general</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.740" end="00:33:04.670" style="s2">population so what what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.410" end="00:33:08.390" style="s2">if true that the amount of virus you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.670" end="00:33:12.050" style="s2">exposed to is actually correlated with</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.390" end="00:33:13.880" style="s2">how sick you get in terms of how it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.050" end="00:33:18.010" style="s2">might mean we should be behaving both an</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.880" end="00:33:18.010" style="s2">individual on the public health level so</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.280" end="00:33:23.720" style="s2">first let me explain why this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.980" style="s2">confusing if viruses were toxins then</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.720" end="00:33:26.120" style="s2">the more you get exposed to the sick</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.980" end="00:33:27.410" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.120" end="00:33:30.650" style="s2">straightforward but that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.410" end="00:33:34.430" style="s2">viruses are viruses like asbestos or let</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.650" end="00:33:35.870" style="s2">right density dependence well it&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.430" end="00:33:39.530" style="s2">this is different because it triggers a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.870" end="00:33:41.450" style="s2">cancer and okay but anyway yeah led or</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.530" end="00:33:42.980" style="s2">you know arsenic or whatever the more of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.450" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">it you get exposed to the more symptoms</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.490" end="00:34:08.869" style="s2">or that one virus jumps the gap and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.800" end="00:34:13.159" style="s2">invades a cell so it&#39;s kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.159" end="00:34:17.330" style="s2">quickly that the immune system launches</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.409" end="00:34:22.700" style="s2">a slightly different response with each</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.700" end="00:34:26.840" style="s2">because the antibodies that we create</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.440" end="00:34:29.240" style="s2">must be somewhat generalizable they</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.240" end="00:34:33.470" style="s2">something that hasn&#39;t mutated in any way</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.649" end="00:34:36.740" style="s2">at all well at some point I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.470" end="00:34:40.210" style="s2">going to put together a lecture on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.740" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">basic immuno biology that underlies our</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.210" end="00:34:43.790" style="s2">ability to fight off disease in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:47.899" style="s2">first place so that people can have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.790" end="00:34:50.149" style="s2">kind of context for this I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.899" end="00:34:53.240" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of necessary to get to the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.149" end="00:34:55.820" style="s2">deeper answer but one aspect of this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.240" end="00:34:58.690" style="s2">that we have an immune system that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.820" end="00:35:02.510" style="s2">capable of reacting to absolutely any</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.690" end="00:35:05.240" style="s2">the pathogen we might encounter it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.510" end="00:35:08.360" style="s2">highly precise when you get the pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.240" end="00:35:13.700" style="s2">anew the system starts to learn it</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.360" end="00:35:15.859" style="s2">evolves a new pattern match for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.700" end="00:35:18.950" style="s2">virus or the bacterium and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.859" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">you fend it off but part of the if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.950" end="00:35:24.080" style="s2">maybe that the system in order to</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:26.869" style="s2">recognize every possible thing you might</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.080" end="00:35:29.960" style="s2">encounter is is distributed pretty thin</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.869" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">and so it may be that somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.960" end="00:35:36.080" style="s2">been exposed to a big load overwhelms</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:40.190" style="s2">that part of the immune system that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.080" end="00:35:41.840" style="s2">actually anywhere in range and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.190" end="00:35:44.780" style="s2">something along these lines may be</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.840" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">resulting in that paradoxical dosage</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.780" end="00:35:49.190" style="s2">dependent degree of illness so might an</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:51.230" style="s2">analogy be that within the body all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.190" end="00:35:52.700" style="s2">the workers are doing triage and no one</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.230" end="00:35:54.650" style="s2">is allowed to specialize and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.700" end="00:35:56.390" style="s2">the solution yeah something like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.650" end="00:36:00.170" style="s2">yeah or you know you&#39;re so overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.390" end="00:36:03.170" style="s2">that that themselves are doing jobs for</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.170" end="00:36:04.670" style="s2">which they&#39;re not very well matched or</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.170" end="00:36:06.109" style="s2">something like that once forced into</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.670" end="00:36:07.430" style="s2">being a generalist all the cells are</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.109" end="00:36:09.290" style="s2">forced into being a generalist when what</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.430" end="00:36:10.490" style="s2">you need is actually for some of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.290" end="00:36:12.080" style="s2">some of the cell lines to be going deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.490" end="00:36:14.200" style="s2">to develop the antibodies to give you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.080" end="00:36:17.600" style="s2">the immune response that you need right</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.200" end="00:36:22.130" style="s2">but there is a message</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.600" end="00:36:25.190" style="s2">here right for one thing a I should say</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.130" end="00:36:27.020" style="s2">after our first live stream we got a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.190" end="00:36:29.630" style="s2">number of messages from people who had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.020" end="00:36:31.670" style="s2">story similar to yours about an illness</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.630" end="00:36:33.590" style="s2">that they had in January or February</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.670" end="00:36:35.600" style="s2">which they did not understand to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.590" end="00:36:38.750" style="s2">covered 19 but in retrospect looks like</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.600" end="00:36:43.400" style="s2">it may well have been there&#39;s also a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.750" end="00:36:46.730" style="s2">of evidence emerging of these non of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.400" end="00:36:48.680" style="s2">these non symptomatic infections which I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.730" end="00:36:51.170" style="s2">may have had you were sick or maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.680" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t get it but but these non</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.170" end="00:36:58.420" style="s2">symptomatic infections have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:37:00.740" style="s2">dual meaning to us on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.420" end="00:37:03.020" style="s2">they&#39;re very serious because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.740" end="00:37:05.030" style="s2">non symptomatic but you&#39;re spreading</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.020" end="00:37:07.400" style="s2">this thing you&#39;re you know you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.030" end="00:37:09.800" style="s2">hazard to those around you you know you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.400" end="00:37:11.450" style="s2">may not have any negative consequences</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.800" end="00:37:15.350" style="s2">but you could spread it you know to your</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.450" end="00:37:17.240" style="s2">grandmother and kill her right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.350" end="00:37:19.610" style="s2">very serious from an epidemiological</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.240" end="00:37:21.710" style="s2">point of view on the other hand to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.610" end="00:37:24.890" style="s2">extent that what is going on is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.710" end="00:37:28.130" style="s2">there is variation in the virus and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.890" end="00:37:30.980" style="s2">some versions of it are causing less</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.130" end="00:37:33.260" style="s2">serious infections or that somebody gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.980" end="00:37:36.380" style="s2">a low dosage and they have a completely</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.260" end="00:37:39.890" style="s2">manageable infection there in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.380" end="00:37:43.100" style="s2">somewhere is two kinds of hope one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.890" end="00:37:45.050" style="s2">the kinds of hope is that the virus will</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.100" end="00:37:47.180" style="s2">quickly evolve to a more manageable</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.050" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">state that it will be less deadly</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.180" end="00:37:51.950" style="s2">because as pathogens tend to as they</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:53.960" style="s2">tend to automatically because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.950" end="00:37:56.660" style="s2">good for them to be killing people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.960" end="00:37:59.840" style="s2">can no longer spread the virus and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.660" end="00:38:01.130" style="s2">other thing is that it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.840" end="00:38:06.410" style="s2">there&#39;s variation in the human</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.130" end="00:38:09.140" style="s2">population which leaves a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.410" end="00:38:11.150" style="s2">immune or near immune to this and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.140" end="00:38:16.010" style="s2">both places</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.150" end="00:38:21.230" style="s2">evolution can produce a a more navigable</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.010" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">scenario but here&#39;s the the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.230" end="00:38:26.390" style="s2">most troubling and the one that I&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">concerned people will take the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.390" end="00:38:31.010" style="s2">this is speculation and I would really</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.250" end="00:38:33.560" style="s2">like to hear somebody epidemiologically</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.010" end="00:38:38.900" style="s2">you know an epidemiologist respond to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.560" end="00:38:42.950" style="s2">this but an asymptomatic infection is</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.900" end="00:38:44.660" style="s2">effectively a vaccine right now that may</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.950" end="00:38:48.110" style="s2">not be true as Heather mentioned on our</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.660" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">last live stream there are diseases like</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.110" end="00:38:52.010" style="s2">dengue that you can get twice and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:53.660" style="s2">fact the second time you get it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.010" end="00:38:55.190" style="s2">much more devastating than the first</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.660" end="00:38:57.800" style="s2">time so it&#39;s possible that this is like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.190" end="00:39:01.180" style="s2">an inverse vaccine but to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.800" end="00:39:05.450" style="s2">that immunity arises out of exposure</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.180" end="00:39:07.400" style="s2">then you know I mean in fact Edward</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.450" end="00:39:14.920" style="s2">Jenner when he invented the first</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.400" end="00:39:17.560" style="s2">vaccine that Europeans had he used</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.920" end="00:39:20.570" style="s2">smallpox</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.560" end="00:39:24.920" style="s2">he used cow pox</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.570" end="00:39:27.080" style="s2">to generate immunity by administering</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.920" end="00:39:29.750" style="s2">effectively milkmaids he had noticed</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.080" end="00:39:31.580" style="s2">weren&#39;t getting smallpox and they did</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.750" end="00:39:35.330" style="s2">get cow pox which was a non-lethal</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.580" end="00:39:37.790" style="s2">infection so anyway the question is and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.330" end="00:39:39.740" style="s2">you know this is obviously tied up in</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.790" end="00:39:43.070" style="s2">the herd immunity that is being widely</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.740" end="00:39:44.690" style="s2">discussed but some fraction of us seem</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.070" end="00:39:46.850" style="s2">to be getting the disease without</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.690" end="00:39:49.220" style="s2">getting the symptoms and they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.850" end="00:39:51.980" style="s2">effectively vaccinating through a non</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.220" end="00:39:53.360" style="s2">technical mechanism at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.980" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">they may be spreading disease to other</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.360" end="00:39:57.070" style="s2">people so I&#39;m not advocating anybody</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:59.960" style="s2">pursue the disease again caveat that</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.070" end="00:40:01.610" style="s2">having had it and having antibodies to</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.960" end="00:40:03.800" style="s2">it is actually protective and provides</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.610" end="00:40:05.210" style="s2">immunity as opposed to actually puts you</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.800" end="00:40:07.250" style="s2">at further risk for which there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.210" end="00:40:08.870" style="s2">an asterisk we just don&#39;t know there</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.250" end="00:40:11.720" style="s2">have been a couple of reports out of I</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.870" end="00:40:14.780" style="s2">think it&#39;s Taiwan that suggest the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.720" end="00:40:16.820" style="s2">dengue model yeah it&#39;d be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.780" end="00:40:18.500" style="s2">see if anybody sees that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.820" end="00:40:22.280" style="s2">elsewhere yeah it&#39;s really a vital piece</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.500" end="00:40:24.080" style="s2">of information to know 100% oh one other</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.280" end="00:40:26.950" style="s2">point I wanted to make there sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.080" end="00:40:29.810" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be in hog in the space I</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.950" end="00:40:31.940" style="s2">want people to notice the following odd</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.810" end="00:40:35.180" style="s2">fact that seems to have nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.940" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">with the situation at all despite the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.180" end="00:40:41.360" style="s2">fact that we sometimes say sick is a dog</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:44.600" style="s2">an expression I&#39;ve never understood dogs</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.360" end="00:40:48.280" style="s2">do not get illnesses that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.600" end="00:40:53.930" style="s2">transmitted to people now this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.280" end="00:40:56.600" style="s2">interesting anomaly because we can get</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.930" end="00:40:58.700" style="s2">obviously if kovat 19 from a bat that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.600" end="00:41:01.580" style="s2">a pretty great phylogenetic distance for</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:04.340" style="s2">that virus to have jumped we certainly</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.580" end="00:41:07.820" style="s2">get flus from birds that&#39;s a much wider</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.340" end="00:41:10.010" style="s2">gap for viruses to jump so it is readily</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.820" end="00:41:12.860" style="s2">possible for viruses to jump between</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.010" end="00:41:15.110" style="s2">very distantly related creatures the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.860" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">fact that we don&#39;t get or that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.110" end="00:41:22.070" style="s2">give colds and flu to our dogs and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:24.410" style="s2">don&#39;t give it to us is a conspicuous</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.070" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">fact also true for caps there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.410" end="00:41:31.090" style="s2">thing that we do get from cats which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">toxoplasmosis which is a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.090" end="00:41:36.200" style="s2">situation but and obviously rabies can</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:39.560" style="s2">go between dogs and people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.200" end="00:41:41.270" style="s2">there&#39;s this one brutal fatal disease</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.560" end="00:41:43.640" style="s2">that can go between dogs and humans but</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.270" end="00:41:46.370" style="s2">it always comes with manifestations it</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.640" end="00:41:48.380" style="s2">comes with symptoms yeah now actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.370" end="00:41:50.930" style="s2">this is the perfect segue because you</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.380" end="00:41:54.410" style="s2">and I had a very jarring experience in</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.930" end="00:41:57.980" style="s2">Madagascar once when rabies began to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.410" end="00:42:00.320" style="s2">spread in the dog population in the area</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.980" end="00:42:03.710" style="s2">that we were in Martin cetera yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.320" end="00:42:05.960" style="s2">we came to town without knowing what was</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.710" end="00:42:07.490" style="s2">going on just like I was working on an</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.960" end="00:42:08.930" style="s2">island off the coast and we&#39;d come into</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.490" end="00:42:11.510" style="s2">town every two-and-a-half weeks or so to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.930" end="00:42:15.230" style="s2">re-up our rice supply and get tomato</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.510" end="00:42:17.960" style="s2">salad basically when we came into town</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.230" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">at this at this one point we encountered</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.960" end="00:42:22.340" style="s2">a dead dog by the side of the road that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:24.530" style="s2">was not in and of itself all that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.340" end="00:42:27.740" style="s2">unusual but then we encountered another</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.530" end="00:42:29.180" style="s2">and another and another the entire town</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.740" end="00:42:30.830" style="s2">was filled with them yes there were</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.180" end="00:42:33.710" style="s2">hundreds hundreds of dead dogs just</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.830" end="00:42:36.950" style="s2">lying on the road and and in the night</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.710" end="00:42:38.780" style="s2">they came the the sanitation workers</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.950" end="00:42:41.060" style="s2">came and cleaned them all out they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.780" end="00:42:43.310" style="s2">killed them they put out poisoned food I</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.060" end="00:42:45.020" style="s2">think wasn&#39;t me one night and then and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.310" end="00:42:46.520" style="s2">they were left all day in the tropical</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.020" end="00:42:48.320" style="s2">Sun and then we happened to be there</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.520" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">during that day and then they came that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.320" end="00:42:55.790" style="s2">night and scooped them all up so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:57.870" style="s2">the way this all links up is there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:43:01.530" style="s2">obvious reason that dogs should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.870" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">immune to human flu and colds and if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.530" end="00:43:07.890" style="s2">think about it wouldn&#39;t it be a target</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:09.990" style="s2">for flu and colds to get into dogs to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.890" end="00:43:11.550" style="s2">move from one person to the next you</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.990" end="00:43:14.280" style="s2">know one person interacts with the sick</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.550" end="00:43:15.690" style="s2">dog they get the disease they give it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.280" end="00:43:18.210" style="s2">a few people those people give it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.690" end="00:43:20.670" style="s2">their dogs it would be an extra way for</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.210" end="00:43:23.670" style="s2">a virus to move around so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.670" end="00:43:26.040" style="s2">guessing has happened is that when dogs</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.670" end="00:43:28.170" style="s2">have gotten sick with something people</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.040" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">are sick with my guess is people have</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.170" end="00:43:33.000" style="s2">killed them and they&#39;ve started over</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:37.740" style="s2">which has selected for immunity to those</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:40.140" style="s2">things and the reason I raise it here is</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.740" end="00:43:43.020" style="s2">that what I don&#39;t think we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.140" end="00:43:46.260" style="s2">enough of is considering you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.020" end="00:43:48.330" style="s2">trying to behave in ways that prevent</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.260" end="00:43:50.040" style="s2">the disease from spreading that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.330" end="00:43:53.610" style="s2">good that&#39;s the right thing to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.040" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">but we also ought to be managing how the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.610" end="00:44:00.540" style="s2">pathogen evolves so that it moves in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:03.990" style="s2">direction that becomes more tolerable</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.540" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">and I confess I don&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.990" end="00:44:09.000" style="s2">that but it does seem that our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:11.220" style="s2">may have handed us dogs that have</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.000" end="00:44:13.320" style="s2">exactly the kind of immunity that we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.220" end="00:44:14.790" style="s2">seeking for ourselves it almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.320" end="00:44:16.920" style="s2">certainly took harsh measures to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.790" end="00:44:19.710" style="s2">there and so you know self quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.920" end="00:44:22.080" style="s2">self-isolation this this flatten the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.710" end="00:44:24.180" style="s2">curve but it&#39;s very very hard on almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.080" end="00:44:26.460" style="s2">everyone but it&#39;s a lot less harsh than</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.180" end="00:44:28.320" style="s2">killing all your pets yeah which may</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.460" end="00:44:29.820" style="s2">well be how we ended up with dogs that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.320" end="00:44:33.140" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to trance be able to transmit</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.820" end="00:44:34.860" style="s2">anything to us other than rabies yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.140" end="00:44:37.970" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.860" end="00:44:37.970" style="s2">what are we at timewise ech</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:50.500" style="s2">okay do we want to continue on or we as</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.780" end="00:44:52.030" style="s2">they&#39;re super chat stuff or maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.500" end="00:44:53.950" style="s2">should I think we&#39;ve covered a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.030" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">territory it&#39;ll take people some time to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.950" end="00:44:59.050" style="s2">digest it okay so let me let me just let</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:01.090" style="s2">me tag what some of the things we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.050" end="00:45:02.680" style="s2">doing next time so that we actually do</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.090" end="00:45:05.110" style="s2">it since we sort of promised a society</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.680" end="00:45:07.210" style="s2">level analysis last time and we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.110" end="00:45:09.490" style="s2">get there so we want to talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.210" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">bit about conspiracy theories that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.490" end="00:45:14.740" style="s2">out there about this why public works or</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:22.330" style="s2">the answer or something like the WPA</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.740" end="00:45:30.280" style="s2">from the 40s 50s 40s 50s thirties well</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.330" end="00:45:31.870" style="s2">we&#39;re and why social distancing measures</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.280" end="00:45:34.690" style="s2">that are in place which are important</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.870" end="00:45:36.760" style="s2">should not be conflated with stay at</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.690" end="00:45:38.470" style="s2">home and you know unfortunately some</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.760" end="00:45:42.010" style="s2">local governments are actually keeping</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.470" end="00:45:43.060" style="s2">people out of public natural places in</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.010" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">the state of Oregon all the state parks</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.060" end="00:45:47.380" style="s2">are closed including a many hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:49.840" style="s2">acres Park it&#39;s walking distance from</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.380" end="00:45:51.700" style="s2">our home which is frankly insane so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.840" end="00:45:55.900" style="s2">we&#39;ll get we&#39;ll get back to some of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.700" end="00:45:58.380" style="s2">those implications on our next one but</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.900" end="00:46:01.180" style="s2">let us yeah one more piece of business</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.380" end="00:46:03.820" style="s2">it occurs to me so we when we were</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.180" end="00:46:05.470" style="s2">teaching it at Evergreen we made a point</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.820" end="00:46:07.270" style="s2">when we had made errors in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.470" end="00:46:10.090" style="s2">presentation to come back and clean them</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.270" end="00:46:12.100" style="s2">up later yeah you and I each made an</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.090" end="00:46:13.600" style="s2">error at least at least one each at</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.100" end="00:46:15.340" style="s2">least one yes feel free to call our</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.600" end="00:46:17.770" style="s2">attention to others so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.340" end="00:46:20.680" style="s2">start I said that dengue wasn&#39;t a virus</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.770" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">and it is I didn&#39;t know what it was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.680" end="00:46:26.230" style="s2">a virus so there&#39;s that yep so I should</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:27.730" style="s2">say as you said that I was shocked to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.230" end="00:46:29.560" style="s2">hear that dengue wasn&#39;t a virus and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.730" end="00:46:31.690" style="s2">briefly thought there might be a major</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.560" end="00:46:34.540" style="s2">hole in my education but anyway it turns</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.690" end="00:46:37.240" style="s2">out it&#39;s a virus and I said that an</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.540" end="00:46:39.310" style="s2">acorn was not a nut and it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.240" end="00:46:41.320" style="s2">acorns are of course nuts so turns out</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.310" end="00:46:44.200" style="s2">to have been a nutty position yes it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.320" end="00:46:47.530" style="s2">it was a non nutty position but in a bad</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.200" end="00:46:50.020" style="s2">way yeah all right super chats so I</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.069" end="00:47:00.520" style="s2">matter yeah yeah super chats are</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.510" end="00:47:03.490" style="s2">questions that people have paid to</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.990" end="00:47:40.900" style="s2">get it early well it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.490" end="00:47:42.549" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about chicken pox at</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.900" end="00:47:45.540" style="s2">dinner last night with our children we</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.549" end="00:47:48.490" style="s2">were now I must say chicken pox is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.540" end="00:47:51.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit of a dicey call</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.490" end="00:47:55.000" style="s2">because on the one hand the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.670" end="00:47:57.549" style="s2">when we were kids parents the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.000" end="00:47:59.349" style="s2">amongst certain parents was that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.549" end="00:48:01.510" style="s2">should encourage your kid to get chicken</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.349" end="00:48:04.750" style="s2">pox so they get it early because getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.510" end="00:48:07.210" style="s2">it late can be deadly so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.750" end="00:48:09.670" style="s2">reason to get it but of course there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.210" end="00:48:12.309" style="s2">also a serious downside to having had</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.670" end="00:48:15.750" style="s2">chicken pox ever which is Fingal&#39;s which</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.309" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">is the same I guess it&#39;s varicella virus</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.750" end="00:48:21.030" style="s2">which reimburses from hiding I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:23.829" style="s2">also point out as a biologist who</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.030" end="00:48:25.809" style="s2">specializes in trade-offs that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.829" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">the cost we know about we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.809" end="00:48:29.799" style="s2">what other costs there might be of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:32.650" style="s2">having this virus latent for your whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.799" end="00:48:35.230" style="s2">life so chicken pox</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.650" end="00:48:37.270" style="s2">was a case in which medical judgment</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.230" end="00:48:38.619" style="s2">amongst some people suggested getting it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.270" end="00:48:40.030" style="s2">early was a good thing because it</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.619" end="00:48:43.390" style="s2">prevented you from getting it late this</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.030" end="00:48:44.829" style="s2">is another case where the the virus</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.390" end="00:48:47.049" style="s2">itself is sort of functioning as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.829" end="00:48:49.809" style="s2">vaccine in this case people having</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.049" end="00:48:52.619" style="s2">parties to convey the disease to their</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.809" end="00:48:56.650" style="s2">kids now we have a vaccine for</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.619" end="00:48:59.950" style="s2">chickenpox I&#39;m going to annoy people by</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.650" end="00:49:01.750" style="s2">pointing out that we do not we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.950" end="00:49:03.339" style="s2">based on the way these things are tested</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.750" end="00:49:04.650" style="s2">have good information on the full</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.339" end="00:49:06.299" style="s2">downside of</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.650" end="00:49:09.510" style="s2">the vaccine it just hasn&#39;t been around</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.299" end="00:49:11.069" style="s2">long enough for us to know and my strong</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.510" end="00:49:14.010" style="s2">suspicion would be that we are not</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.069" end="00:49:15.900" style="s2">tracking cases well enough to know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.010" end="00:49:17.940" style="s2">happens to people in their 70s 80s 90s</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.900" end="00:49:20.250" style="s2">who have had the vaccine but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.940" end="00:49:23.039" style="s2">we now have a vaccine which appears to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.250" end="00:49:24.390" style="s2">give us an even better solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.039" end="00:49:25.859" style="s2">chickenpox problem which is to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.390" end="00:49:27.150" style="s2">you from ever getting yet rather than</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.859" end="00:49:29.010" style="s2">giving it to you as a child that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.150" end="00:49:31.410" style="s2">prevents you from getting it late and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.010" end="00:49:34.650" style="s2">suffering a serious harm or getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.410" end="00:49:36.529" style="s2">shingles late which is survivable but by</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.650" end="00:49:41.039" style="s2">all accounts are quite terrible</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.529" end="00:49:43.950" style="s2">condition to face I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.039" end="00:49:46.049" style="s2">answer to the question of are we going</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.950" end="00:49:49.799" style="s2">to encourage people to get it early if</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.049" end="00:49:53.270" style="s2">our family had it the case Zach had was</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.799" end="00:49:57.869" style="s2">not a minor thing yep so it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.270" end="00:49:59.730" style="s2">the that the pattern that we come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.869" end="00:50:02.430" style="s2">ultimately recognize is that this is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.730" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">as benign in young people as we think it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.430" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">is or it may evolve to be different over</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:10.770" style="s2">time that&#39;s right so if we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">through these within 15-20 minutes we</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.770" end="00:50:14.460" style="s2">should I don&#39;t know if we are some of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">these aren&#39;t questions I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.460" end="00:50:18.210" style="s2">really need to read those out loud</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:20.309" style="s2">should we stop eating human meat - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.210" end="00:50:21.630" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a good idea yes thank you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.309" end="00:50:26.670" style="s2">for that question I have certainly</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.630" end="00:50:28.859" style="s2">stopped yeah long time ago yep so next</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.670" end="00:50:30.420" style="s2">one but what if it mutates what is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.859" end="00:50:32.250" style="s2">likelihood that SARS - might mutate so</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.420" end="00:50:33.690" style="s2">significantly during this outbreak that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.250" end="00:50:36.270" style="s2">we have to make serious changes and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.690" end="00:50:38.549" style="s2">we do with societies to fight it well I</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.270" end="00:50:41.160" style="s2">think it doesn&#39;t have to mutate for that</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.549" end="00:50:43.410" style="s2">to be the case I think that we that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.160" end="00:50:44.700" style="s2">will change what we do is fight yes and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.410" end="00:50:46.980" style="s2">this is this is where some of where</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.700" end="00:50:49.289" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to next time yeah up at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.980" end="00:50:50.010" style="s2">top I said I don&#39;t think things ever go</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.289" end="00:50:53.309" style="s2">back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.010" end="00:50:57.660" style="s2">and I really believe that whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.309" end="00:51:00.990" style="s2">I mean one of my fears having now seen</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.660" end="00:51:03.349" style="s2">people respond to Cove at 19 this is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.990" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">first time in my life that I have seen</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.349" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">society having a proper discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:09.990" style="s2">infectious disease how its transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:11.940" style="s2">what behavioral changes you can make</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.990" end="00:51:13.980" style="s2">it&#39;s the first time in my life the last</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.940" end="00:51:15.900" style="s2">thing I want is for the discussion to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.980" end="00:51:17.400" style="s2">back to normal right but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.900" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">life is going to go back to normal and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.400" end="00:51:22.890" style="s2">because I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:28.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve just learned is that we have we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.890" end="00:51:33.350" style="s2">acquired a new what shall I call it a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.200" end="00:51:35.940" style="s2">stowaway we&#39;ve acquired something as</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.350" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">dangerous and indeed much more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.940" end="00:51:43.050" style="s2">than the flu at this point and as far as</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:46.950" style="s2">we know we are stuck with that new</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.050" end="00:51:49.170" style="s2">fellow traveler we cannot afford to keep</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.950" end="00:51:52.260" style="s2">acquiring new ones the burden to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.170" end="00:51:54.390" style="s2">humanity of having another phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.260" end="00:51:56.100" style="s2">like the flu traveling at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.390" end="00:51:58.380" style="s2">the flu hasn&#39;t gone anywhere that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.100" end="00:52:00.390" style="s2">devastating we can&#39;t keep doing this so</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.380" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">I do think that this is going to result</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.390" end="00:52:05.910" style="s2">in major alterations to the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.880" end="00:52:07.290" style="s2">civilization functions and the good part</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.910" end="00:52:09.660" style="s2">of it is that hopefully it has</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.290" end="00:52:14.970" style="s2">permanently upgraded our discussion so</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.660" end="00:52:16.530" style="s2">that we can behave in a more reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.970" end="00:52:18.270" style="s2">fashion with respect to not spreading</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.530" end="00:52:19.650" style="s2">disease to each other for individuals it</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.270" end="00:52:22.890" style="s2">was a kind of Epidemiology school</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.650" end="00:52:24.930" style="s2">assuming things return to something like</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.890" end="00:52:28.650" style="s2">what we recognized from before and at</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.930" end="00:52:31.230" style="s2">the society level it is revealed so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.650" end="00:52:33.270" style="s2">of the fragility in across all levels in</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.230" end="00:52:35.340" style="s2">society that perhaps perhaps we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.270" end="00:52:37.140" style="s2">begin to have that conversation is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.340" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">can you scroll up so we can see we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.140" end="00:52:44.790" style="s2">know what we&#39;ve done yet you need to can</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">you okay please try to ant you go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.790" end="00:52:49.830" style="s2">please try to answer Zach please try to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:51.540" style="s2">answer if a person is asymptomatic and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.830" end="00:52:53.460" style="s2">tests positive how long are they likely</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.540" end="00:52:57.930" style="s2">to continue to be able to carry Kovan to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.460" end="00:53:00.330" style="s2">others we don&#39;t know but something you</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.930" end="00:53:04.200" style="s2">know potentially a couple weeks is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.330" end="00:53:08.100" style="s2">short answer well so I would say this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.200" end="00:53:09.960" style="s2">one where what we need is the best</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.100" end="00:53:12.030" style="s2">experts we&#39;ve got to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.960" end="00:53:13.470" style="s2">question directly we&#39;re not in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.030" end="00:53:18.090" style="s2">position to do it we don&#39;t have a lab we</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.470" end="00:53:20.070" style="s2">don&#39;t study Cove at 19 but knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.090" end="00:53:22.890" style="s2">answer to that question and then knowing</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.070" end="00:53:25.320" style="s2">the answer to how persistent these</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.890" end="00:53:26.520" style="s2">things actually are and that&#39;s a data</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.320" end="00:53:29.070" style="s2">that&#39;s going to have to continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.520" end="00:53:30.029" style="s2">taken because they can mutate and change</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.070" end="00:53:33.419" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.029" end="00:53:34.949" style="s2">in response to our behavior so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.419" end="00:53:37.109" style="s2">know the answer to the question but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.949" end="00:53:40.859" style="s2">would say you definitely want to err in</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.109" end="00:53:43.189" style="s2">the direction of staying away and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.859" end="00:53:45.389" style="s2">know I&#39;d say a couple weeks at a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.189" end="00:53:46.889" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the question of if</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.389" end="00:53:48.989" style="s2">you&#39;re contagious for a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.889" end="00:53:51.479" style="s2">and you call on something and it can</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.989" end="00:53:54.869" style="s2">remain live on a certain amount of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.479" end="00:53:58.289" style="s2">you&#39;ve coughed on to for another week or</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.869" end="00:54:01.439" style="s2">more you&#39;re talking about a long period</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.289" end="00:54:03.509" style="s2">of infectiousness yeah so I just want</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.439" end="00:54:05.999" style="s2">logisitics question between the three of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.509" end="00:54:07.259" style="s2">us in this room I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.999" end="00:54:08.609" style="s2">generating more questions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.259" end="00:54:10.229" style="s2">taking so long with each I&#39;m not sure</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.690" end="00:57:34.750" style="s2">because they&#39;re spending more time at</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.950" end="00:57:37.089" style="s2">home this is not necessarily the moment</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.750" end="00:57:38.530" style="s2">to learn how to use power tools because</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.089" end="00:57:39.790" style="s2">this is exactly the not the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.530" end="00:57:43.540" style="s2">you want to end up in a hospital for</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.180" end="00:57:54.390" style="s2">past some ones that we missed SEC</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.720" end="00:57:56.009" style="s2">Japan azad was infected early did almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.390" end="00:57:58.519" style="s2">nothing to stop the virus now has very</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.009" end="00:58:02.960" style="s2">few cases or deaths can you explain why</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.519" end="00:58:07.309" style="s2">masks is one thing it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.960" end="00:58:10.349" style="s2">no social stigma against wearing masks</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.309" end="00:58:12.630" style="s2">yeah there there&#39;s a lot here it could</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.349" end="00:58:15.569" style="s2">be something in Japanese culture I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.630" end="00:58:16.499" style="s2">want to this is a dangerous topic</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.569" end="00:58:17.940" style="s2">because to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.499" end="00:58:20.249" style="s2">anything could be resident somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.940" end="00:58:22.769" style="s2">culture speculating about it is liable</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.249" end="00:58:26.430" style="s2">to leave you offending somebody but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.769" end="00:58:28.890" style="s2">could be Japanese fastidiousness it</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.430" end="00:58:31.259" style="s2">could be the lack of a social stigma</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.890" end="00:58:33.569" style="s2">around masks it could be given the blood</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.259" end="00:58:34.980" style="s2">type appears to be an issue it could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.569" end="00:58:37.049" style="s2">that there&#39;s something in the Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.980" end="00:58:41.309" style="s2">population sure the question again Zach</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.049" end="00:58:42.779" style="s2">just go back to the the previous one did</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.309" end="00:58:45.299" style="s2">almost nothing to stop the virus so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.779" end="00:58:47.249" style="s2">don&#39;t know beyond this question what it</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.299" end="00:58:48.900" style="s2">did or did not do it not familiar but</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.249" end="00:58:53.759" style="s2">did it leave its borders open it left</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.900" end="00:58:58.650" style="s2">its airports open it restricted travel</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.759" end="00:59:00.450" style="s2">from only to Chinese provinces I believe</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.650" end="00:59:03.239" style="s2">okay so airports open is obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.450" end="00:59:05.519" style="s2">huge on the other hand it is it is an</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.239" end="00:59:06.859" style="s2">archipelago so any place where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.519" end="00:59:09.839" style="s2">no land-based</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.859" end="00:59:11.309" style="s2">you know border crossing potentially if</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.839" end="00:59:13.109" style="s2">the airports were opened there was no</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.309" end="00:59:14.430" style="s2">checking that doesn&#39;t help but in</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.109" end="00:59:16.259" style="s2">general an island nation should be</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.430" end="00:59:18.239" style="s2">better able to deal with such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.259" end="00:59:19.499" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking off the top of my head here</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.239" end="00:59:21.930" style="s2">that I do think that they checked</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.499" end="00:59:23.670" style="s2">people&#39;s temperature from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.930" end="00:59:26.130" style="s2">yes yeah which wouldn&#39;t catch</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.670" end="00:59:28.109" style="s2">asymptomatic cases I would write they</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.130" end="00:59:30.049" style="s2">did have a case I believe one of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.109" end="00:59:33.480" style="s2">cruise ships that was just thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.049" end="00:59:34.859" style="s2">infected with the stuff docked on their</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.480" end="00:59:36.900" style="s2">Shores but anyway it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.859" end="00:59:40.200" style="s2">question and there are really two kinds</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.900" end="00:59:42.890" style="s2">of answer is it something Japan did or</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.200" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">is it something about Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.890" end="00:59:49.799" style="s2">physiology in either case it would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:53.690" style="s2">very good to know there are companies in</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.799" end="00:59:53.690" style="s2">China that have commercialized Cova 19</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.140" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">and immunoglobulin M and I guess that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.809" end="01:00:02.489" style="s2">in home testing kits cost around $10</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:04.320" style="s2">that&#39;s an observation that someone has</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.489" end="01:00:06.600" style="s2">made it&#39;s not a question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.320" end="01:00:08.580" style="s2">great if true yep great if true oh I</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.600" end="01:00:10.320" style="s2">love the next question and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.580" end="01:00:11.880" style="s2">the time to do it here but I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.320" end="01:00:13.590" style="s2">gladly this is something I used to teach</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.880" end="01:00:15.270" style="s2">on all the time what determines close to</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.590" end="01:00:20.460" style="s2">us he said the bats are not as close as</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.270" end="01:00:22.350" style="s2">birds why oh yeah the why is that bats</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.460" end="01:00:26.490" style="s2">and humans have a more recent common</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.350" end="01:00:28.200" style="s2">ancestor than humans and birds do and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.490" end="01:00:30.360" style="s2">can show you phylogenetic trees all day</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.200" end="01:00:32.670" style="s2">and walk us through both the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.360" end="01:00:34.590" style="s2">of science of that and the science of</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.670" end="01:00:38.670" style="s2">science of that but that will be a</p>

<p begin="01:01:41.460" end="01:01:45.480" style="s2">like the case fatality rate probably</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.560" end="01:01:47.370" style="s2">being over reported which is good news</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.480" end="01:01:48.630" style="s2">because we aren&#39;t testing sufficiently</p>

<p begin="01:01:48.630" end="01:01:54.360" style="s2">should actually look like on the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.090" end="01:01:58.290" style="s2">hand there are there are plenty of</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.430" end="01:03:34.760" style="s2">answer the question I think generally I</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.470" end="01:03:37.340" style="s2">would like some sort of brain trust to</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.760" end="01:03:39.890" style="s2">be thinking about the deeper strategic</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.340" end="01:03:41.960" style="s2">implications of how we behave at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.890" end="01:03:44.030" style="s2">moment the fact that the political</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.960" end="01:03:46.190" style="s2">apparatus has become aware that there is</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.030" end="01:03:49.760" style="s2">something that it is responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.190" end="01:03:53.450" style="s2">dealing with that&#39;s good but the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.760" end="01:03:56.330" style="s2">strategy itself is pretty thin and a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.450" end="01:03:58.400" style="s2">of the tools were using are quite blunt</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.330" end="01:04:00.680" style="s2">so what I would love to see is a room</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.400" end="01:04:02.750" style="s2">full of people who are not responsible</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.680" end="01:04:05.030" style="s2">to the public on a daily basis</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.750" end="01:04:08.600" style="s2">explaining what they&#39;re doing thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.030" end="01:04:11.210" style="s2">about the deeper strategy and what what</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.600" end="01:04:15.800" style="s2">might actually function so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.210" end="01:04:18.100" style="s2">implement measures that are negative in</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.800" end="01:04:21.800" style="s2">the end but seem you know give the</p>

<p begin="01:04:21.800" end="01:04:24.100" style="s2">of thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.079" end="01:04:30.430" style="s2">how likely is it that this virus escaped</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.239" end="01:04:33.099" style="s2">from China&#39;s only level 4 virology lab</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.430" end="01:04:35.470" style="s2">which happens to be in Wuhan this is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.099" end="01:04:38.529" style="s2">great question I am NOT an expert in</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.470" end="01:04:42.849" style="s2">things Wuhan virology labs</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.529" end="01:04:47.380" style="s2">any of these things but I will say much</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.849" end="01:04:50.289" style="s2">depends on what the data that we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.380" end="01:04:51.999" style="s2">available to us actually means in other</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.289" end="01:04:55.749" style="s2">words somebody could have created a hoax</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.999" end="01:04:57.700" style="s2">or so let me say to that we are going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.749" end="01:04:59.229" style="s2">speak specifically to some of some of</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.700" end="01:05:01.569" style="s2">the conspiracy theories out there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.229" end="01:05:03.190" style="s2">but no conspiracy conspiracy theory has</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.569" end="01:05:05.529" style="s2">a bad name because a lot of them are</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.190" end="01:05:06.609" style="s2">tinfoil hat style ridiculousness which</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.529" end="01:05:09.009" style="s2">is some of what we&#39;ll be talking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.609" end="01:05:11.499" style="s2">but also conspiracies happen therefore</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.009" end="01:05:13.569" style="s2">some conspiracy theories are true so</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.499" end="01:05:16.930" style="s2">calling this a conspiracy theory is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.569" end="01:05:18.460" style="s2">a value judgment about it&#39;s nonsensical</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.930" end="01:05:20.769" style="s2">mess I would say we should call it a</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.460" end="01:05:23.519" style="s2">conspiracy hypothesis for lots of</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.769" end="01:05:25.809" style="s2">reasons that I will cover elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.519" end="01:05:27.099" style="s2">conspiracy theory would be a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.809" end="01:05:28.839" style="s2">that&#39;s actually happened and we can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.099" end="01:05:30.219" style="s2">sure of it which has happened a great</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.839" end="01:05:37.269" style="s2">many times it&#39;s not going to catch on</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.219" end="01:05:39.940" style="s2">though but I must say I am quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.269" end="01:05:42.940" style="s2">troubled by the possibility that given</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.940" end="01:05:44.710" style="s2">that there is a virology lab apparently</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.940" end="01:05:46.269" style="s2">you know I could discover that I have</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.710" end="01:05:49.269" style="s2">bad information here but if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.269" end="01:05:53.529" style="s2">virality lab that was studying corona</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.269" end="01:05:56.650" style="s2">viruses in bats in Wuhan obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.529" end="01:06:00.549" style="s2">highly likely that something happened</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.650" end="01:06:03.249" style="s2">either as an accident somebody was</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.549" end="01:06:04.539" style="s2">careless in the lab or they were playing</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.249" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">around with something</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.539" end="01:06:10.299" style="s2">do I want responsibility for advancing</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:14.079" style="s2">that idea into the world absolutely not</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.299" end="01:06:16.390" style="s2">because it could well be you know there</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.079" end="01:06:18.190" style="s2">are lots of ways this could work but I</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.390" end="01:06:21.309" style="s2">do think we have to worry about it and</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.190" end="01:06:24.759" style="s2">among the many things among the many</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.309" end="01:06:29.039" style="s2">messages that are clear is that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.759" end="01:06:32.680" style="s2">ability to wreak havoc on planet Earth</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.039" end="01:06:35.979" style="s2">exists in the pathogens of wild</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.680" end="01:06:37.719" style="s2">creatures that is a lot of power to</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.979" end="01:06:38.329" style="s2">place in the hands of people who do not</p>

<p begin="01:06:38.329" end="01:06:43.609" style="s2">long-term well-being at heart and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.509" end="01:06:46.369" style="s2">there is no solution to that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.609" end="01:06:49.489" style="s2">involves personal responsibility that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.369" end="01:06:52.249" style="s2">involves nations navigating this each</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.489" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">according to their own rules this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.249" end="01:06:55.789" style="s2">something that has to be dealt with as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:06:58.309" style="s2">result of the fact that we have a</p>

<p begin="01:07:18.499" end="01:07:22.549" style="s2">yeah okay but to some degree his brother</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.019" end="01:07:24.140" style="s2">is more than naturalist and he&#39;s more of</p>

<p begin="01:07:42.829" end="01:07:46.309" style="s2">were adaptive reasons for it I heard</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.299" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">that Kovan may cause heart damage what</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.309" end="01:07:51.229" style="s2">are those reasons let me give the quick</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">and dirty version yep your heart is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.229" end="01:07:58.609" style="s2">very special organ it&#39;s a pump that</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:08:01.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fail even once in a proper life</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.609" end="01:08:03.890" style="s2">of 80 maybe a hundred years right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.609" end="01:08:08.029" style="s2">a remarkable kind of machine</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.890" end="01:08:09.559" style="s2">it functions unlike a machine pump that</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.029" end="01:08:14.059" style="s2">we would create in other words it has</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.559" end="01:08:19.190" style="s2">lots of circulation within it and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.059" end="01:08:21.230" style="s2">vessels in the heart are vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.190" end="01:08:22.670" style="s2">being blocked by a growth that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.230" end="01:08:25.040" style="s2">bother you if it were in your liver</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.670" end="01:08:26.750" style="s2">you&#39;d never know it was there and so my</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.040" end="01:08:29.480" style="s2">hypothesis from the paper that I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.750" end="01:08:32.449" style="s2">many years ago on this topic is that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.480" end="01:08:35.779" style="s2">low tolerance that the heart has for a</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.449" end="01:08:39.109" style="s2">growth of cells out of place has caused</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.779" end="01:08:41.569" style="s2">the dial on tumor prevention to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.109" end="01:08:44.210" style="s2">turned all the way down so you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.569" end="01:08:47.000" style="s2">a little pea-sized blockage in a in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.210" end="01:08:50.059" style="s2">artery that causes your heart to fail</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.000" end="01:08:51.529" style="s2">and the turning down the self repair</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.059" end="01:08:53.900" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.529" end="01:08:55.339" style="s2">prevents those growths from happening</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.900" end="01:08:58.489" style="s2">but it leaves the heart very vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.339" end="01:09:01.039" style="s2">to toxic insult and other things and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.489" end="01:09:04.039" style="s2">one pattern we have seen here which I</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.039" end="01:09:07.250" style="s2">must say I I didn&#39;t have a good reason</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.039" end="01:09:10.239" style="s2">for imagining it but it definitely has</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.250" end="01:09:13.699" style="s2">me worried was the NSAIDs the</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.239" end="01:09:16.520" style="s2">non-steroidal anti-inflammatories I know</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.699" end="01:09:18.859" style="s2">from my own work on telomeres and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.520" end="01:09:21.619" style="s2">pharmaceuticals that they have all been</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.859" end="01:09:23.480" style="s2">shown to do heart damage of one kind or</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.619" end="01:09:26.750" style="s2">another I absolutely avoid these things</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.480" end="01:09:29.389" style="s2">I take aspirin which humans have a long</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.750" end="01:09:32.119" style="s2">history rarely with I take it very rare</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.389" end="01:09:34.670" style="s2">let&#39;s take us any of this very often but</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.119" end="01:09:36.589" style="s2">if I can&#39;t take aspirin for some reason</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.670" end="01:09:38.509" style="s2">I&#39;ll take tylenol tylenol which is not a</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.589" end="01:09:40.489" style="s2">safe drug it&#39;s a dangerous drug but at</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.509" end="01:09:43.250" style="s2">least we think that the damage that it</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.489" end="01:09:45.829" style="s2">does is to your liver and the damage it</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.250" end="01:09:49.219" style="s2">does to your liver is liver is capacity</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.829" end="01:09:51.020" style="s2">you can afford to spend so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.219" end="01:09:53.779" style="s2">what livers our livers our detoxifying</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.020" end="01:09:56.630" style="s2">organs yeah so in any case the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.779" end="01:10:00.760" style="s2">kovat 19:00 has been made worse</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.630" end="01:10:04.280" style="s2">apparently by the other the NSAIDs is</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.760" end="01:10:06.050" style="s2">pretty pretty interesting but anyway I</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.280" end="01:10:07.909" style="s2">think generally what we&#39;re detecting is</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.050" end="01:10:10.400" style="s2">that because of the way the heart is</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.909" end="01:10:12.800" style="s2">built it is very vulnerable to insults</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.400" end="01:10:14.900" style="s2">of all kinds covered 19 being one kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.800" end="01:10:16.730" style="s2">of insult and seds being another kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.900" end="01:10:19.130" style="s2">insult the combination of them being</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.730" end="01:10:22.010" style="s2">particularly bad but we should expect</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.130" end="01:10:23.659" style="s2">this from here on out which is that many</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.010" end="01:10:27.730" style="s2">things that are really bad for us are</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.659" end="01:10:29.840" style="s2">especially bad for our hearts yeah good</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.730" end="01:10:32.090" style="s2">thanks for the content level listening</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.840" end="01:10:35.750" style="s2">to the two of you thank you what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.090" end="01:10:37.099" style="s2">economic what&#39;s the economic trade off</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.750" end="01:10:38.449" style="s2">between constantly keeping the country</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.099" end="01:10:40.219" style="s2">and locked down and risking a second</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.449" end="01:10:42.079" style="s2">wave versus opening up the country again</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.219" end="01:10:46.309" style="s2">and just letting everyone get infected</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.079" end="01:10:48.289" style="s2">and building immunity exactly well I</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.309" end="01:10:50.869" style="s2">mean I think you&#39;ve stated the trade off</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.289" end="01:10:52.849" style="s2">there rather well and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.869" end="01:10:56.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge amount of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.849" end="01:10:58.550" style="s2">around what this virus will do if left</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.270" end="01:10:59.320" style="s2">to its own devices and what it will do</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.550" end="01:11:01.510" style="s2">under</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.320" end="01:11:04.389" style="s2">the kind of crude management that we are</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.510" end="01:11:06.550" style="s2">deploying but let me say that the virus</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.389" end="01:11:08.290" style="s2">today is not inherently the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.550" end="01:11:10.210" style="s2">as the virus even in three weeks or</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.290" end="01:11:11.619" style="s2">three months and certainly not in three</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.210" end="01:11:12.849" style="s2">years and no one&#39;s expecting a lockdown</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.619" end="01:11:19.150" style="s2">for three years that&#39;s obviously not</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.849" end="01:11:20.619" style="s2">tenable but the longer the longer time</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.150" end="01:11:22.260" style="s2">period during which we can socially</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.619" end="01:11:25.090" style="s2">distance and work to flatten the curve</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.260" end="01:11:26.829" style="s2">the more chance that we are that that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.090" end="01:11:29.320" style="s2">have that a our health systems don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.829" end="01:11:31.000" style="s2">overwhelmed of course but that there</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.320" end="01:11:32.710" style="s2">might be developments with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.000" end="01:11:35.409" style="s2">either prophylaxis to keep you from</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.710" end="01:11:37.360" style="s2">getting it or a vaccine so the</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.409" end="01:11:38.530" style="s2">distinction being a somewhat subtle one</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.360" end="01:11:40.360" style="s2">but for instance there&#39;s no vaccine for</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.530" end="01:11:44.679" style="s2">malaria but there is prophylaxis that</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.360" end="01:11:47.260" style="s2">variably works or drugs to treat so also</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.679" end="01:11:49.960" style="s2">the virus you know the longer it exists</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.260" end="01:11:52.810" style="s2">with us likely the less virulent it gets</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.960" end="01:11:54.639" style="s2">so it is far better if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.810" end="01:11:57.310" style="s2">get this to get it later than to get it</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.639" end="01:11:59.409" style="s2">now and so trying to fast forward her an</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.310" end="01:12:01.420" style="s2">immunity right now is a much more</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.409" end="01:12:03.219" style="s2">dangerous prospect that imagining that</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.420" end="01:12:04.929" style="s2">even if all of humanity ultimately ends</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.219" end="01:12:07.420" style="s2">up getting exposed it would be over a</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.929" end="01:12:09.190" style="s2">longer period of time yeah so actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.420" end="01:12:11.980" style="s2">we should put together a list of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.190" end="01:12:15.909" style="s2">reasons that getting it later would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.980" end="01:12:19.540" style="s2">positive um one of them if you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.909" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">it I&#39;m sorry for repeating it but just</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.540" end="01:12:24.699" style="s2">the simple fact that we will know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:25.960" style="s2">more about what to do you know there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.699" end="01:12:28.960" style="s2">be less burden on the system and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.960" end="01:12:31.659" style="s2">know more what to do is probably reason</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.960" end="01:12:34.780" style="s2">reason enough in and of itself there</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.659" end="01:12:36.730" style="s2">will be more data on every front and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.780" end="01:12:38.800" style="s2">know especially once there are serology</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.730" end="01:12:40.989" style="s2">tests man just beating this drum like I</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.800" end="01:12:43.239" style="s2">did in the last live stream we did but</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.989" end="01:12:44.829" style="s2">once their antibody tests and we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.239" end="01:12:46.210" style="s2">actually have an answer to the question</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.829" end="01:12:47.949" style="s2">that was asked earlier about how many</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.210" end="01:12:50.679" style="s2">people have likely been exposed and</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.949" end="01:12:52.750" style="s2">therefore tracking those cases that</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.679" end="01:12:54.880" style="s2">weren&#39;t identified as Co vat19 were</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.750" end="01:12:56.469" style="s2">symptomatic but turned out to be cope at</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.880" end="01:12:58.510" style="s2">19 and beginning to put those data</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.469" end="01:13:01.599" style="s2">together into an epidemiological</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.510" end="01:13:03.219" style="s2">analysis such that you know is is this</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.599" end="01:13:04.750" style="s2">thing where you begin to feel better and</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.219" end="01:13:07.329" style="s2">feel like you&#39;re better and then it hits</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.750" end="01:13:09.820" style="s2">you hard is is that really something</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.329" end="01:13:12.460" style="s2">that this that this disease is doing to</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.820" end="01:13:14.500" style="s2">people reliably the more people who</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.460" end="01:13:17.560" style="s2">know that if it is true the better the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.500" end="01:13:21.310" style="s2">more lives will be saved I would say</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.560" end="01:13:24.340" style="s2">though if we step back a little bit it</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.310" end="01:13:28.660" style="s2">is also important that we learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.340" end="01:13:32.860" style="s2">manage let&#39;s say that kovat 19 continues</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.660" end="01:13:34.810" style="s2">on a pace without a seasonal reprieve</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.860" end="01:13:37.030" style="s2">let&#39;s say I expect to season a reprieve</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.810" end="01:13:39.239" style="s2">for one set of reasons not for another</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.030" end="01:13:42.550" style="s2">but nonetheless let&#39;s say it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.239" end="01:13:44.320" style="s2">figuring out how to operate in the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.550" end="01:13:47.980" style="s2">so you can get the things done that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.320" end="01:13:49.270" style="s2">need to get done that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.980" end="01:13:50.680" style="s2">something we&#39;re gonna have to do and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.270" end="01:13:52.170" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna discover a lot of things you</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.680" end="01:13:54.850" style="s2">know if this doesn&#39;t work we&#39;ll find out</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.170" end="01:13:58.210" style="s2">if it does work it&#39;s good to know and</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.850" end="01:13:59.770" style="s2">maybe we will discover that we all you</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.210" end="01:14:01.120" style="s2">know do the same way we put on a shirt</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.770" end="01:14:04.570" style="s2">in the morning we need to do something</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.120" end="01:14:06.580" style="s2">to prevent spreading airborne diseases</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.570" end="01:14:07.930" style="s2">but we&#39;re gonna have to learn those</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.580" end="01:14:09.940" style="s2">things we&#39;re gonna have to get more</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.930" end="01:14:14.440" style="s2">surgical about what activities we</p>

<p begin="01:14:14.440" end="01:14:18.550" style="s2">so that we can do them during an</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:20.860" style="s2">epidemic like this but you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.550" end="01:14:25.890" style="s2">ultimately we&#39;re gonna have to learn to</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.860" end="01:14:27.450" style="s2">manage it this is for Zach awesome work</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.890" end="01:14:31.870" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.450" end="01:14:39.190" style="s2">in C you just scrolled up we can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.870" end="01:14:42.640" style="s2">the next question yeah might prolong</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.190" end="01:14:45.969" style="s2">social distancing reduce it was up</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.640" end="01:14:48.790" style="s2">farther kiddo that went up top can you</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.969" end="01:14:50.710" style="s2">show me okay in most countries the ratio</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.790" end="01:14:53.050" style="s2">of positive cases to total test it</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.710" end="01:14:55.989" style="s2">reduces as tests go up absolutely this</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.050" end="01:14:58.810" style="s2">is the denominator problem document he</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.989" end="01:15:02.620" style="s2">says he or she says UK Sweden Denmark</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.810" end="01:15:05.140" style="s2">went down from 10 to 5 percent in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.620" end="01:15:06.580" style="s2">last 10 days the u.s. is study at 16</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.140" end="01:15:09.580" style="s2">percent even though testing is</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.580" end="01:15:10.600" style="s2">increasing any idea why testing is</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.580" end="01:15:13.450" style="s2">increasing but it&#39;s not increasing</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.600" end="01:15:16.060" style="s2">enough and anecdotally I&#39;ve heard a</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.450" end="01:15:19.060" style="s2">number of stories of people being told</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.060" end="01:15:20.260" style="s2">by doctors yes this is you almost</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.060" end="01:15:22.780" style="s2">certainly have this but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.260" end="01:15:25.110" style="s2">enough tests so I want you to quarantine</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.780" end="01:15:26.909" style="s2">at home and come back in</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.110" end="01:15:27.929" style="s2">if you absolutely need to but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.909" end="01:15:30.480" style="s2">even going to test you</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.929" end="01:15:33.809" style="s2">so even symptomatic cases aren&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.480" end="01:15:35.400" style="s2">being tested from the US I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.809" end="01:15:36.750" style="s2">that that isn&#39;t happening elsewhere but</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.400" end="01:15:39.270" style="s2">I know that that is happening in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.750" end="01:15:43.710" style="s2">u.s. I would say I don&#39;t want to allege</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.270" end="01:15:47.150" style="s2">anything but there is a danger about</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.710" end="01:15:50.699" style="s2">monkeying with baseline in order to</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.150" end="01:15:52.679" style="s2">adjust the way a particular crisis is</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.699" end="01:15:54.599" style="s2">understood I don&#39;t know whether I</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.679" end="01:15:56.820" style="s2">suspect that did happen is it still</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.599" end="01:15:59.130" style="s2">happening I don&#39;t know but the data</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.820" end="01:16:02.280" style="s2">hasn&#39;t settled down because in some</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.130" end="01:16:03.750" style="s2">sense it&#39;s spotty and yeah I guess we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.280" end="01:16:07.290" style="s2">see as the data gets better what the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.750" end="01:16:11.070" style="s2">pattern really is yep okay the next one</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.290" end="01:16:12.570" style="s2">we already answered you know how much of</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.070" end="01:16:14.400" style="s2">the data coming from China should we</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.570" end="01:16:16.020" style="s2">believe considering the pandemic was</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.400" end="01:16:21.929" style="s2">caused by their lies in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.020" end="01:16:23.790" style="s2">thanks for Montreal well I don&#39;t stumped</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.929" end="01:16:26.340" style="s2">us yeah I don&#39;t know how to answer that</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.790" end="01:16:28.710" style="s2">for one thing I don&#39;t know which lies</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.340" end="01:16:33.380" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about can we see the</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.710" end="01:16:33.380" style="s2">question thanks good</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.099" end="01:16:42.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s too much of a hot potato I</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.510" end="01:16:43.980" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to we&#39;ve got too much</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.360" end="01:16:46.559" style="s2">variance on what may have happened we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.980" end="01:16:49.369" style="s2">got everything from a natural escape</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.559" end="01:16:52.619" style="s2">from bush meat at a wet market to</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.369" end="01:16:55.199" style="s2">virology lab that you know in the worst</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.619" end="01:16:57.059" style="s2">case was creating a bioweapon we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.199" end="01:17:00.300" style="s2">know what took place so it makes it very</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.059" end="01:17:02.219" style="s2">hard to calibrate what was being said I</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.300" end="01:17:04.380" style="s2">do think there&#39;s you know what has there</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.219" end="01:17:05.849" style="s2">been mismanagement on the part of as far</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.380" end="01:17:08.099" style="s2">as we can tell every government pretty</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.849" end="01:17:11.130" style="s2">much yeah have there been active lies</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.099" end="01:17:14.730" style="s2">coming out of China probably and in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.130" end="01:17:17.040" style="s2">u.s. saying the pudendal was penned emic</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.730" end="01:17:19.230" style="s2">was caused by their lies is for me a</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.040" end="01:17:21.239" style="s2">bridge too far I&#39;m not prepared to go</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.230" end="01:17:24.199" style="s2">there I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t be true</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.239" end="01:17:26.699" style="s2">but I haven&#39;t seen the evidence for it</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.199" end="01:17:29.250" style="s2">all right do you think societies require</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.699" end="01:17:33.020" style="s2">a specific catastrophe per generation to</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.250" end="01:17:33.020" style="s2">educate them to that specific if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.270" end="01:17:40.980" style="s2">you know I think in some sense this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.540" end="01:17:45.460" style="s2">what this is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.980" end="01:17:47.800" style="s2">enduring art is for is to preserve an</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.460" end="01:17:49.780" style="s2">understanding of catastrophe so not</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.800" end="01:17:53.530" style="s2">everybody has to experience it directly</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.780" end="01:17:57.340" style="s2">that said as you will see in the book</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.530" end="01:18:00.700" style="s2">that that we are producing novelty is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.340" end="01:18:04.540" style="s2">massive problem for us evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.700" end="01:18:06.670" style="s2">novelty and the problem with our</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.540" end="01:18:10.870" style="s2">catastrophes is that they are taking on</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.670" end="01:18:12.930" style="s2">a new nature right so obviously</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.870" end="01:18:18.130" style="s2">airplanes are playing a role in this</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.930" end="01:18:19.870" style="s2">epidemic that is relatively new now</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.130" end="01:18:22.440" style="s2">obviously that those airplanes have been</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.870" end="01:18:24.700" style="s2">spreading lots of less serious diseases</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.440" end="01:18:28.360" style="s2">for a long period of time and obviously</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.700" end="01:18:30.330" style="s2">HIV was transported on airplanes but but</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.360" end="01:18:32.080" style="s2">nonetheless the problem is that our</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.330" end="01:18:36.160" style="s2">transporter and airplanes have</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.080" end="01:18:37.690" style="s2">presumably not transmitted much well</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.160" end="01:18:39.730" style="s2">that really depends but no I meant</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.690" end="01:18:42.460" style="s2">transported just so yeah gonna jump</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.730" end="01:18:46.690" style="s2">oceans in a way that&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.460" end="01:18:48.700" style="s2">become trivial but in any case the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.690" end="01:18:50.590" style="s2">problem is that our catastrophes have so</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.700" end="01:18:52.780" style="s2">much new content that the stories that</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.590" end="01:18:55.060" style="s2">should be protecting us from them</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.780" end="01:18:57.640" style="s2">haven&#39;t been written yet and at one</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.060" end="01:19:00.490" style="s2">level if you want a really depressing</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.640" end="01:19:02.470" style="s2">idea we have to get over the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.490" end="01:19:03.940" style="s2">stories are about entertainment and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.470" end="01:19:07.090" style="s2">we should be hearing stories that make</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.940" end="01:19:11.710" style="s2">us feel good and happy and the point is</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.090" end="01:19:14.410" style="s2">stories actually are they are adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.710" end="01:19:16.090" style="s2">and we have hijacked them for</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.410" end="01:19:19.560" style="s2">educational purposes but it is time that</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.090" end="01:19:22.120" style="s2">our stories take on an impactful</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.560" end="01:19:23.890" style="s2">responsibility I love this idea we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.120" end="01:19:26.470" style="s2">talked about it before if this is what</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.890" end="01:19:27.790" style="s2">enduring art is for right and so you</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.470" end="01:19:30.070" style="s2">know the Russians seem to have gotten</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.790" end="01:19:31.690" style="s2">this Tolstoy and Sultanate&#39;s in both you</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.070" end="01:19:35.260" style="s2">know war and peace and the Gulag</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.690" end="01:19:37.030" style="s2">Archipelago both clearly described in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.260" end="01:19:41.200" style="s2">way that is accessible for for most</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.030" end="01:19:44.410" style="s2">people some of the horrors that that</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.200" end="01:19:47.020" style="s2">occurred in 19th and 20th century Russia</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.410" end="01:19:48.940" style="s2">and in Soviet Union and you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.020" end="01:19:50.830" style="s2">Guernica yeah there there it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.940" end="01:19:51.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not just through narrative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.830" end="01:19:53.500" style="s2">also through two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.880" end="01:19:56.320" style="s2">three-dimensional art that we end up</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.500" end="01:19:57.640" style="s2">being able to understand some other</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.320" end="01:19:59.290" style="s2">piece of humanity that we have not</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.640" end="01:20:02.290" style="s2">ourselves lived through this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.290" end="01:20:07.900" style="s2">what art is and it&#39;s it&#39;s part of why we</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.290" end="01:20:10.120" style="s2">need it thank you again to Zak wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.900" end="01:20:13.920" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.120" end="01:20:17.920" style="s2">my prolonged wow that&#39;s very generous</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:19.870" style="s2">that&#39;s Lee thanks so much Lee might</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.920" end="01:20:22.000" style="s2">prolonged social distancing reduce herd</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.870" end="01:20:24.670" style="s2">immunity to other pathogens resulting in</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.000" end="01:20:28.660" style="s2">for example a very very bad influenza</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.670" end="01:20:31.330" style="s2">season in the future I actually wanted</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.660" end="01:20:34.750" style="s2">to cover this topic roughly let me look</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.330" end="01:20:36.280" style="s2">at the my prolonged sources in it let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.750" end="01:20:37.540" style="s2">let&#39;s introduce the question in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.280" end="01:20:39.670" style="s2">following way and maybe we can address</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.540" end="01:20:43.200" style="s2">it next time the question is now that</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.670" end="01:20:45.940" style="s2">humanity has upgraded its response to</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.200" end="01:20:47.640" style="s2">infectious disease sort of all of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.940" end="01:20:50.290" style="s2">sudden we took a crash course</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.640" end="01:20:52.960" style="s2">what will the evolutionary response of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.290" end="01:20:55.420" style="s2">the flu itself be my guess is that flu</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.960" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">is having a very hard time transmitting</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.420" end="01:20:58.960" style="s2">in the period since people have started</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">wearing masks so anyway there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.960" end="01:21:05.320" style="s2">whole thing to to address which is what</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:08.020" style="s2">do we do and what is the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.320" end="01:21:10.840" style="s2">response of the pathogen and given</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.020" end="01:21:13.510" style="s2">whatever that pattern is can we manage</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.840" end="01:21:16.420" style="s2">these things into a better state for us</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.510" end="01:21:18.580" style="s2">the way our dogs were apparently managed</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.420" end="01:21:21.100" style="s2">or potentially managed by our ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.580" end="01:21:24.370" style="s2">to make them such good companions yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.100" end="01:21:26.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a great question and it speaks to</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.370" end="01:21:28.510" style="s2">the actual interconnectedness that as</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.530" end="01:21:31.120" style="s2">you know it is been observed widely at</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.510" end="01:21:32.340" style="s2">this point that most countries in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.120" end="01:21:34.690" style="s2">world right now could not withstand</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.340" end="01:21:37.000" style="s2">effectively a natural disaster or</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.690" end="01:21:40.060" style="s2">another or another widespread pathogen</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.000" end="01:21:42.670" style="s2">so we are acting we are coming together</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.060" end="01:21:44.920" style="s2">to some degree over this we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.670" end="01:21:47.590" style="s2">acting as if this is the thing this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.920" end="01:21:48.790" style="s2">the enemy from outside that we have all</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.590" end="01:21:51.760" style="s2">been waiting for to bring us together</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.790" end="01:21:53.800" style="s2">well it&#39;s not the only thing and there</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.760" end="01:21:56.110" style="s2">will be there will be downstream and</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.800" end="01:21:59.860" style="s2">negative effects of even the best</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.110" end="01:22:01.510" style="s2">the best rot procedures here all right</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.860" end="01:22:03.430" style="s2">you said in the last podcast that</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.510" end="01:22:06.400" style="s2">authorities weren&#39;t telling us the whole</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.430" end="01:22:10.810" style="s2">truth or or we&#39;re hiding something can</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.400" end="01:22:13.090" style="s2">you elaborate I could tell you but then</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.810" end="01:22:13.480" style="s2">they&#39;d have to kill me all right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.090" end="01:22:16.210" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.480" end="01:22:18.040" style="s2">you know no I would say we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.210" end="01:22:20.050" style="s2">this a little bit next time maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.040" end="01:22:23.910" style="s2">is always a feature which is that they</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.050" end="01:22:25.989" style="s2">have perverse incentives with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.910" end="01:22:28.330" style="s2">telling us the whole truth there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.989" end="01:22:29.410" style="s2">always this idea that we can&#39;t handle it</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.330" end="01:22:31.210" style="s2">and that we will panic and that that</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.410" end="01:22:33.850" style="s2">will make things worse which is almost</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.210" end="01:22:37.030" style="s2">always a prelude to things being done</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.850" end="01:22:39.880" style="s2">not on our behalf and then in this case</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.030" end="01:22:43.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.880" end="01:22:46.210" style="s2">of a hot potato of responsibility and in</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.690" end="01:22:48.130" style="s2">particular I&#39;m worried about baseline I</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.210" end="01:22:50.020" style="s2">want to know what&#39;s actually going on so</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.130" end="01:22:53.290" style="s2">that we can navigate in something other</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.020" end="01:22:55.870" style="s2">than a blind fashion and the political</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.290" end="01:22:57.250" style="s2">apparatus is obviously aware that it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.870" end="01:22:58.780" style="s2">going to be held accountable and that</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.250" end="01:23:01.630" style="s2">there are things that can do that will</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.780" end="01:23:05.590" style="s2">make it look like it actually performed</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.630" end="01:23:08.260" style="s2">better than it did good this guy wants</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.590" end="01:23:09.430" style="s2">Brett you just send him some DNA so he</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.260" end="01:23:11.350" style="s2">can create a bunch of ice cream with his</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.430" end="01:23:12.940" style="s2">jeans we are sexually reproducing so I</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.350" end="01:23:14.380" style="s2">don&#39;t think Brett&#39;s DNA is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.940" end="01:23:14.890" style="s2">sufficient but yeah thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.380" end="01:23:18.310" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.890" end="01:23:20.770" style="s2">love you guys also the guy&#39;s name seems</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.310" end="01:23:22.000" style="s2">to be male so it&#39;s we you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.770" end="01:23:23.710" style="s2">can&#39;t combine sperm with sperm it</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.000" end="01:23:26.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work no it needs equal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.710" end="01:23:28.210" style="s2">odd but I mean it works it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.620" end="01:23:30.430" style="s2">produce babies yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.210" end="01:23:31.989" style="s2">also flattening the curve buys us time</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.430" end="01:23:33.910" style="s2">to get masks into the hands of every</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.989" end="01:23:36.280" style="s2">person true and to get those supply</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.910" end="01:23:38.530" style="s2">chains back up that production back up</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.280" end="01:23:39.910" style="s2">ventilators respirators but but masks</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.530" end="01:23:42.310" style="s2">into the hands of every person very good</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.910" end="01:23:44.140" style="s2">point I suspect masks may be a major</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.310" end="01:23:46.390" style="s2">cause the difference between USA Italy</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.140" end="01:23:48.010" style="s2">and Japan South Korea yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.390" end="01:23:49.750" style="s2">think that&#39;s likely right and the and</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.010" end="01:23:52.150" style="s2">the pre-existing cultural norm around</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.750" end="01:23:53.560" style="s2">putting on masks whenever you are sick</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.150" end="01:23:58.120" style="s2">or whenever there is understood to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.560" end="01:24:00.040" style="s2">some kind of outbreak agreed but you may</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.120" end="01:24:02.710" style="s2">think my bandana looks stupid but</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.040" end="01:24:05.230" style="s2">honestly I did a test I took my camera</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.710" end="01:24:07.660" style="s2">and I pointed it at a video light and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.230" end="01:24:09.940" style="s2">set the a si</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.660" end="01:24:11.560" style="s2">the shutter speed and the aperture to a</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.940" end="01:24:16.570" style="s2">proper exposure and then I put my</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.560" end="01:24:19.390" style="s2">bandana over it and it absorbed 999</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.570" end="01:24:21.550" style="s2">photons out of a thousand okay now that</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.390" end="01:24:23.440" style="s2">is not exactly the number of viral</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.550" end="01:24:26.620" style="s2">particles I would expect it to intercept</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.440" end="01:24:28.990" style="s2">but it is not I can&#39;t think of a good</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.620" end="01:24:31.750" style="s2">reason and all the studying I&#39;ve done of</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.990" end="01:24:34.090" style="s2">the you know physics and the like I</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.750" end="01:24:36.250" style="s2">can&#39;t think of a good reason to think</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.090" end="01:24:39.270" style="s2">that the bandana should automatically be</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.250" end="01:24:42.580" style="s2">vastly less effective at trapping</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.270" end="01:24:44.680" style="s2">viruses than it is of trapping photons</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.580" end="01:24:46.300" style="s2">there&#39;s one reason that it should be</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.680" end="01:24:48.940" style="s2">less effective which is as you create</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.300" end="01:24:51.630" style="s2">negative pressure behind the bandana you</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.940" end="01:24:54.130" style="s2">breathe in the particle could snake</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.630" end="01:24:56.620" style="s2">through multiple holes and it could</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.130" end="01:24:59.740" style="s2">reach you on the other hand these viral</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.620" end="01:25:01.900" style="s2">particles a even just the viral particle</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.740" end="01:25:03.970" style="s2">is much bigger than a photon B they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.900" end="01:25:05.770" style="s2">not travelling in isolation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.970" end="01:25:07.570" style="s2">travelling water droplets which are much</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.770" end="01:25:09.310" style="s2">bigger and have an affinity for the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.570" end="01:25:13.870" style="s2">fabric that the bandana is made out of</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.310" end="01:25:15.100" style="s2">so by affinity and I actually saw this</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.870" end="01:25:17.920" style="s2">question on Twitter at some times like</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.100" end="01:25:20.980" style="s2">why why would you want to attract it</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.920" end="01:25:22.570" style="s2">into a fabric the virus stays sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.980" end="01:25:24.520" style="s2">active and on the surface of hard</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.570" end="01:25:26.530" style="s2">surfaces like steel and plastic but into</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.520" end="01:25:28.390" style="s2">fabric it basically it&#39;s the coat around</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.530" end="01:25:30.550" style="s2">the actual RNA gets tangled and stuck</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.390" end="01:25:32.590" style="s2">and deactivated and so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.550" end="01:25:33.940" style="s2">that happens right away or to everything</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.590" end="01:25:36.160" style="s2">and if you touch your bandana right</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.940" end="01:25:37.750" style="s2">after you get contact you could you</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.160" end="01:25:41.350" style="s2">could give it to yourself yeah but in</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.750" end="01:25:43.000" style="s2">general fabrics tend to trap the virus</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.350" end="01:25:45.910" style="s2">and then if you wash those fabrics</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.000" end="01:25:47.950" style="s2">quickly with soap and hot water you will</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.910" end="01:25:50.770" style="s2">deactivate them and wash them away yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.950" end="01:25:52.630" style="s2">and I do I wash my bandana sometimes I</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.770" end="01:25:54.250" style="s2">put on two at different times during the</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.630" end="01:25:56.050" style="s2">day or if I haven&#39;t really been out I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.250" end="01:25:58.180" style="s2">have one but I wash it and I don&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.050" end="01:26:00.700" style="s2">them back on but think about it just at</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.180" end="01:26:02.440" style="s2">a mundane level let&#39;s say you spill take</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.700" end="01:26:04.810" style="s2">a bandana spill some coffee on it</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.440" end="01:26:07.480" style="s2">right you&#39;re talking about a suspension</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.810" end="01:26:09.160" style="s2">of particles inside of water that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.480" end="01:26:10.720" style="s2">the coffee is it gets on your bandanna</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.160" end="01:26:13.750" style="s2">how much of it comes off on your fingers</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.720" end="01:26:15.100" style="s2">when you touch it very little so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.750" end="01:26:17.590" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a perfect measure I</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.100" end="01:26:20.020" style="s2">guarantee you but how good a measure is</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.590" end="01:26:21.160" style="s2">it it&#39;s likely to be very good if this</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.020" end="01:26:22.870" style="s2">isn&#39;t true and</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.160" end="01:26:24.700" style="s2">but he understands the reason that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.870" end="01:26:26.860" style="s2">true I want to hear it but here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.700" end="01:26:27.520" style="s2">point let&#39;s say that my test with my</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.860" end="01:26:31.300" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.520" end="01:26:34.480" style="s2">he is wildly off right and it</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.300" end="01:26:37.150" style="s2">overestimates the effectiveness by an</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.480" end="01:26:38.950" style="s2">order of magnitude that would still</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.150" end="01:26:41.380" style="s2">leave at 99 percent effective at</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.950" end="01:26:43.960" style="s2">trapping viral particles 99% effective</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.380" end="01:26:49.360" style="s2">is mighty effective frankly I&#39;d take 60%</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.960" end="01:26:51.400" style="s2">right but 99% that&#39;s awesome so my</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.360" end="01:26:53.470" style="s2">expectation is that this works it</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.400" end="01:26:55.180" style="s2">certainly does not reduce my vigilance</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.470" end="01:26:57.730" style="s2">on any other front but what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.180" end="01:26:59.260" style="s2">is you don&#39;t need a mask designed for</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.730" end="01:27:01.180" style="s2">the purpose you just need something that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.260" end="01:27:03.400" style="s2">does the job I know lots of people have</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.180" end="01:27:05.980" style="s2">put out videos on YouTube about how to</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.400" end="01:27:07.570" style="s2">make a mask for yourself do you have one</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.980" end="01:27:09.460" style="s2">in your drawer already maybe you do</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.570" end="01:27:11.050" style="s2">somebody should be studying whether</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.460" end="01:27:13.390" style="s2">these things are actually effective so</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.050" end="01:27:15.280" style="s2">that we know that when things happen</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.390" end="01:27:17.860" style="s2">we&#39;re not dependent on a supply chain</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.280" end="01:27:19.690" style="s2">but we can actually get back to doing</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.860" end="01:27:22.090" style="s2">what we need to do with materials on</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.690" end="01:27:26.680" style="s2">hand okay looks like we got three more</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.090" end="01:27:28.480" style="s2">questions yeah needs water</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.680" end="01:27:29.890" style="s2">for more questions the last of which is</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.480" end="01:27:32.740" style="s2">thank you immensely for your work chat</p>

<p begin="01:27:51.120" end="01:27:56.770" style="s2">due to the extraordinary generosity of</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.980" end="01:27:59.710" style="s2">the professor st. known as Robby George</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.770" end="01:28:01.360" style="s2">who encouraged us to apply after Brett</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.710" end="01:28:03.580" style="s2">and Robby met each other</p>

<p begin="01:28:18.390" end="01:28:24.730" style="s2">two years to the day it was one day</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.290" end="01:28:27.420" style="s2">before two years to the day the</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.730" end="01:28:28.800" style="s2">anniversary of the protests at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.420" end="01:28:30.719" style="s2">they erupted in my classroom that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.800" end="01:28:34.140" style="s2">I know well that wouldn&#39;t be right then</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.719" end="01:28:36.870" style="s2">because that was May 23rd 2017 2017 so</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.140" end="01:28:38.550" style="s2">it would have been 2019 okay but you</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.870" end="01:28:40.290" style="s2">said May 16th all right</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.550" end="01:28:42.090" style="s2">I&#39;m confused we are not going to gain</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.290" end="01:28:43.770" style="s2">the chat over it unfortunately that is</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.090" end="01:28:48.060" style="s2">one of the things that I do keep track</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.770" end="01:28:49.830" style="s2">of yep not very interesting um so we</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.060" end="01:28:52.469" style="s2">then we&#39;re invited to speak at for</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.830" end="01:28:54.660" style="s2">instance commencement that&#39;s that fall</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.469" end="01:28:55.860" style="s2">and Robbie then encouraged us to apply</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.660" end="01:28:57.840" style="s2">for these positions which has been</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.860" end="01:28:59.250" style="s2">wonderful although we are visiting well</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.840" end="01:29:01.380" style="s2">but not in residence we are here in</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.250" end="01:29:03.050" style="s2">Portland Oregon is that can you go up so</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.380" end="01:29:06.929" style="s2">I can see if we just answered that one</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.050" end="01:29:08.429" style="s2">good okay so we don&#39;t we have for three</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.929" end="01:29:10.770" style="s2">more quickly how come the other</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.429" end="01:29:12.020" style="s2">coronaviruses disappeared they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.770" end="01:29:17.130" style="s2">they&#39;re still out there</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.020" end="01:29:19.260" style="s2">they they&#39;re still out there stars 100</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.130" end="01:29:21.719" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about stars one and Murs</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.260" end="01:29:24.270" style="s2">actually MERS is still out there and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.719" end="01:29:26.400" style="s2">it erupts it seems to require contact</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.270" end="01:29:28.710" style="s2">with an infected camel in Saudi Arabia</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.400" end="01:29:31.010" style="s2">and so it&#39;s somewhat rare that it</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.710" end="01:29:34.290" style="s2">travels outside of Saudi Arabia I guess</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.010" end="01:29:36.719" style="s2">SARS one is interesting why was it so</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.290" end="01:29:39.090" style="s2">intense much more localized than sighs</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.719" end="01:29:41.820" style="s2">to which we&#39;re living through now and</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.090" end="01:29:43.140" style="s2">what was it it lasted 16 18 months ish</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.820" end="01:29:44.969" style="s2">and then it seems to have gone</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.140" end="01:29:48.600" style="s2">underground I don&#39;t want to claim that</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.969" end="01:29:51.929" style="s2">it&#39;s disappeared I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.600" end="01:29:55.070" style="s2">have an answer to this disappear I mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.929" end="01:29:58.290" style="s2">I think the answer is likely to be a</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.070" end="01:30:02.370" style="s2">mismatch between the available channels</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.290" end="01:30:04.710" style="s2">for transmission and the modality of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.370" end="01:30:08.610" style="s2">virus so you know I keep saying this</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.710" end="01:30:10.560" style="s2">thing which is that the creatures are</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.610" end="01:30:11.880" style="s2">all trying to get into the future it</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.560" end="01:30:14.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that they have a channel</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.880" end="01:30:18.270" style="s2">that&#39;s viable to do so and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.670" end="01:30:20.310" style="s2">let&#39;s take a bola for example Ebola is</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.270" end="01:30:22.790" style="s2">highly effective at being transmitted</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.310" end="01:30:25.050" style="s2">under some circumstances but it is so</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.790" end="01:30:27.210" style="s2">overwhelming to the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.050" end="01:30:28.920" style="s2">contracted it that it burns out quickly</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.210" end="01:30:33.150" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t leap to the next village so</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.920" end="01:30:34.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t know this particular answer but</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.150" end="01:30:36.570" style="s2">the general answer is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.500" end="01:30:39.080" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t structured to persist</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.570" end="01:30:42.440" style="s2">and so some combination of</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.080" end="01:30:44.410" style="s2">immunity awareness and other measures</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.440" end="01:30:46.790" style="s2">and just the simple way that we function</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.410" end="01:30:48.170" style="s2">caused it not to be well adapted and it</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.790" end="01:30:52.820" style="s2">went extinct the way other creatures go</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.170" end="01:30:54.770" style="s2">extinct yeah okay two more heard a New</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.820" end="01:30:56.720" style="s2">York nurse say yesterday that they are</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.770" end="01:30:58.460" style="s2">surprised to see car crash victims with</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.720" end="01:31:03.590" style="s2">lung damage that looks damaged from</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.460" end="01:31:05.390" style="s2">covin thoughts it&#39;s when students when</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.590" end="01:31:07.910" style="s2">we were teaching in the classroom and</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.390" end="01:31:11.500" style="s2">students would ask questions like this I</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.910" end="01:31:13.970" style="s2">would either not engage until I&#39;d seen</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.500" end="01:31:15.950" style="s2">the evidence that this was actually a</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.970" end="01:31:18.620" style="s2">real observation or begin with a very</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.950" end="01:31:21.170" style="s2">strong caveat that any answer is</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.620" end="01:31:24.440" style="s2">assuming that this is actually true and</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.170" end="01:31:25.640" style="s2">so I&#39;m also not even you could interpret</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.440" end="01:31:30.410" style="s2">that question in two ways</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.640" end="01:31:32.990" style="s2">yeah are they seeing damage from Cova</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.410" end="01:31:34.520" style="s2">din car crash victims in other words</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.990" end="01:31:35.720" style="s2">there are more victims than we know and</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.520" end="01:31:36.800" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing it because their look</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.720" end="01:31:38.930" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at x-rays of these</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.800" end="01:31:41.390" style="s2">peoples lungs or does it mean that</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.930" end="01:31:44.420" style="s2">damage from Kove it looks like car crash</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.390" end="01:31:46.730" style="s2">damage anyway hard to answer without</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.420" end="01:31:49.340" style="s2">knowing which of these were even looking</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.730" end="01:31:50.930" style="s2">at okay so so they&#39;re still growing</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.340" end="01:31:53.780" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna only answer three more and</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.930" end="01:31:55.940" style="s2">then we&#39;re done we&#39;re done okay guys can</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.780" end="01:31:58.430" style="s2">we close the transmission of a virus by</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.940" end="01:31:59.780" style="s2">lockdowns as some will never follow with</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.430" end="01:32:01.430" style="s2">the common cold go away if everyone</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.780" end="01:32:04.450" style="s2">isolated for three times the infection</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.430" end="01:32:04.450" style="s2">period that&#39;s two questions</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.510" end="01:32:08.810" style="s2">lockdowns are not going to stop</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.770" end="01:32:11.000" style="s2">transmission because transmission will</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.810" end="01:32:13.460" style="s2">still happen within hospitals as new</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.000" end="01:32:15.410" style="s2">cases come in and within households but</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.460" end="01:32:17.780" style="s2">it will slow radically and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.410" end="01:32:20.300" style="s2">it&#39;s not disappearing the curve it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.780" end="01:32:25.910" style="s2">flattening the curve so you write that</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.300" end="01:32:27.560" style="s2">even even with perfect perfect following</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.910" end="01:32:29.960" style="s2">you know perfect adherence to lock downs</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.560" end="01:32:33.500" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t disappear</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.960" end="01:32:35.600" style="s2">transmissions entirely I wasn&#39;t gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.500" end="01:32:37.790" style="s2">to the next one yeah what is the main</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.600" end="01:32:44.110" style="s2">obstacle to miniaturize virus tests and</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.790" end="01:32:47.180" style="s2">do them via the smartphone energy optics</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.110" end="01:32:49.430" style="s2">the technology my phone isn&#39;t nearly as</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.180" end="01:32:51.430" style="s2">smart as it thinks it is and I just</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.430" end="01:32:54.850" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s up to the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.430" end="01:32:56.680" style="s2">doing this sort of test I&#39;m not sure how</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.850" end="01:32:58.270" style="s2">a smartphone would even be involved I</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.680" end="01:33:00.490" style="s2">just want to test that works I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.270" end="01:33:02.680" style="s2">need it to be an app yeah there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.490" end="01:33:05.800" style="s2">there&#39;s some things that your phone</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.680" end="01:33:07.930" style="s2">presumably can&#39;t do it cannot take in</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.800" end="01:33:12.880" style="s2">fluids you know I can&#39;t do swabs and</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.930" end="01:33:14.920" style="s2">taking blood and such okay last one</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.880" end="01:33:16.330" style="s2">hi guys could social distancing result</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.920" end="01:33:18.130" style="s2">in common colds and other short-lived</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.330" end="01:33:21.910" style="s2">pathogens going extinct in the nations</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.130" end="01:33:25.570" style="s2">that are practicing it extinct is tough</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.910" end="01:33:28.570" style="s2">because the thing is zero is an</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.570" end="01:33:30.670" style="s2">absorbing boundary that&#39;s the idea so if</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.570" end="01:33:32.770" style="s2">you imagine a population of anything</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.670" end="01:33:34.450" style="s2">right a population can fluctuate wildly</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.770" end="01:33:36.880" style="s2">it can get very low you know the</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.450" end="01:33:38.800" style="s2">population of sea otters in the Pacific</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.880" end="01:33:42.190" style="s2">was down to 80 individuals I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.800" end="01:33:43.990" style="s2">something similar happened to elephant</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.190" end="01:33:46.900" style="s2">seals and then they&#39;ve come back up but</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.990" end="01:33:48.760" style="s2">if you imagine 80 is very low but if you</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.900" end="01:33:49.450" style="s2">hit zero something new happens once you</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.760" end="01:33:52.480" style="s2">hit zero</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.450" end="01:33:54.130" style="s2">there&#39;s no bounce and so in order to get</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.480" end="01:33:57.850" style="s2">these things to go extinct you have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.130" end="01:33:59.440" style="s2">hit zero and it&#39;s not inconceivable that</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.850" end="01:34:00.610" style="s2">some sort of measure could cause that to</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.440" end="01:34:03.730" style="s2">happen I think we did it with smallpox</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.610" end="01:34:05.530" style="s2">right seems to be although the question</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.730" end="01:34:07.630" style="s2">you know I remember I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.530" end="01:34:09.580" style="s2">during the Clinton administration there</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.630" end="01:34:11.860" style="s2">was a question about whether to destroy</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.580" end="01:34:13.360" style="s2">the last samples of smallpox because we</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.860" end="01:34:15.850" style="s2">thought we had successfully banished it</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.360" end="01:34:19.990" style="s2">and those samples of course run the risk</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.850" end="01:34:22.750" style="s2">of escaping into the world but I thought</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.990" end="01:34:24.910" style="s2">the decision was right assuming I</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.750" end="01:34:27.850" style="s2">remember what the decision was Troy them</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.910" end="01:34:29.890" style="s2">but there could all we could always be</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.850" end="01:34:31.570" style="s2">hiding somewhere that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.890" end="01:34:33.340" style="s2">about and so you think it&#39;s at zero when</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.570" end="01:34:35.980" style="s2">really it&#39;s just at an undetectably low</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.340" end="01:34:38.440" style="s2">level so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.980" end="01:34:40.060" style="s2">extinction is tough but increasingly we</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.440" end="01:34:42.070" style="s2">should be thinking about this because</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.060" end="01:34:44.650" style="s2">what we are doing at the moment is we</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.070" end="01:34:46.810" style="s2">are inviting new pathogens in and just</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.650" end="01:34:49.180" style="s2">adding them to the calendar and you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.810" end="01:34:51.910" style="s2">what would a normal human life look like</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.180" end="01:34:53.650" style="s2">with respect to colds in comparison to</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.910" end="01:34:55.410" style="s2">this one where people are flying around</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.650" end="01:34:58.420" style="s2">and transporting every cold everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.410" end="01:34:59.800" style="s2">all right thank you guys</p>
