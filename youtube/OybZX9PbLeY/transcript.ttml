<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">youtube channel of crowd democracy I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.550" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">creating a technology cooperative that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">we all own together that&#39;s operated with</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:07.350" style="s2">transparency and democracy but that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:09.390" style="s2">what I am doing with already two people</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.350" end="00:03:12.140" style="s2">we&#39;re meeting on Fridays and doing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.390" end="00:03:14.070" style="s2">at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.140" end="00:03:16.110" style="s2">working through the process of creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.070" end="00:03:18.390" style="s2">our first project which actually is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.110" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">idea Cafe and that&#39;s the project I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.390" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">focusing on in these Saturday mornings</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:24.600" style="s2">which is a little confusing because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">focusing on creating the YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.600" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">idea cafe a space that is for</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:34.110" style="s2">conversations that I want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">in and finding ways to work through</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.110" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">having people working through my</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">limitations figuring out why I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">seem to get three people on camera and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">while ago a few weeks without it and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:46.370" style="s2">growing that YouTube channel I think has</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">a lot of potential both for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.370" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">cooperative and for me and that is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">I am what I&#39;m here to do and also to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">support my my brother who has an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.380" style="s2">project and anyone else because I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">there are so many projects out there</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.380" end="00:04:02.070" style="s2">right now and people who care about</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">creating a better world and I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.070" end="00:04:08.520" style="s2">able to use whatever brain power I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:10.140" style="s2">to help facilitate them and be present</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.520" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">for their projects in whatever format</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.140" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">they&#39;re currently and that is me and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">lot faster than five minutes all right</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.010" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">hi everyone my name is adria and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">project I am starting is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:32.219" style="s2">a collection really short form it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:34.949" style="s2">project to fight its information</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.219" end="00:04:38.669" style="s2">initially it will be focused on politics</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.949" end="00:04:40.529" style="s2">and science two fairly disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.669" end="00:04:44.159" style="s2">things but you might be able to see how</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.529" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">they overlap so on the politics side</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.159" end="00:04:49.169" style="s2">I&#39;ve been summarizing it as it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:50.819" style="s2">like IMDB for politics so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.169" end="00:04:52.710" style="s2">each politician each politician would</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.819" end="00:04:54.330" style="s2">have their own page where it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.710" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">ongoing tally of things they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.330" end="00:04:59.099" style="s2">things they voted on things they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:05:00.569" style="s2">voted on and then a summary of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.099" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">what that means about that person so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.569" end="00:05:04.889" style="s2">what sort of the values you can guess</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.090" end="00:05:07.229" style="s2">they might have based on how they voted</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.889" end="00:05:10.139" style="s2">and things they&#39;ve done and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.229" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">thing there&#39;s also sort of another piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.139" end="00:05:16.319" style="s2">to that where it&#39;s helping to manage it</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:18.180" style="s2">elections so as we get a bigger list of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.319" end="00:05:20.789" style="s2">all the politicians when people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.180" end="00:05:22.770" style="s2">running in elections it gives an easier</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.789" end="00:05:25.409" style="s2">way to compare all the options for</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.770" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">voters in the election then on the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.409" end="00:05:31.639" style="s2">side of that there&#39;s the sort of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:34.939" style="s2">the science part where it&#39;s about I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.639" end="00:05:38.069" style="s2">guess did discussing in reviewing</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.939" end="00:05:39.800" style="s2">different forms of content initially it</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.069" end="00:05:42.479" style="s2">will be things like scientific studies</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.800" end="00:05:44.039" style="s2">where the community would take it apart</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:46.319" style="s2">and answer different questions about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.039" end="00:05:48.089" style="s2">at things like was the experiment design</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.319" end="00:05:50.669" style="s2">properly was a conducted properly who</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.089" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">paid for it that type of thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.669" end="00:05:56.779" style="s2">the end goal of that is to have you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:05:59.370" style="s2">a large library of scientific studies</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.779" end="00:06:01.649" style="s2">reviewed by the community towards a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.370" end="00:06:03.509" style="s2">certain topic for example vaccines so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.649" end="00:06:05.699" style="s2">that we can start to answer common</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.509" end="00:06:07.979" style="s2">questions you know with some actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.699" end="00:06:11.599" style="s2">proof behind it that people can dive</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.979" end="00:06:11.599" style="s2">deeper into if they feel the need</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.159" end="00:06:17.909" style="s2">awesome Thanks we both did that in much</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.930" end="00:06:19.860" style="s2">under five minutes we&#39;ll see if we later</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.909" end="00:06:21.509" style="s2">on and we&#39;re also talking about our what</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.860" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">we committed to the previous week I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.509" end="00:06:26.879" style="s2">sure we will go longer the other things</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:29.069" style="s2">we didn&#39;t discuss one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.879" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">this started was last Friday you and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.069" end="00:06:33.149" style="s2">were having a conversation that lasted</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:36.479" style="s2">for four hours and every time we have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.149" end="00:06:38.729" style="s2">conversation we are creating technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:40.589" style="s2">that isn&#39;t necessarily arts projects but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.729" end="00:06:41.249" style="s2">just like little oh yeah we could create</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.589" end="00:06:42.719" style="s2">that and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.249" end="00:06:44.729" style="s2">create that and so I wanted to also</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.719" end="00:06:46.139" style="s2">showcase a bit of that one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.729" end="00:06:47.939" style="s2">we didn&#39;t discuss is how long we want</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.139" end="00:06:51.989" style="s2">the actual live portion of this to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.939" end="00:06:53.549" style="s2">not four hours I&#39;m I&#39;m thinking we might</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.989" end="00:06:56.219" style="s2">want to keep the live version today at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.549" end="00:06:58.049" style="s2">half an hour and then in the future when</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.219" end="00:07:00.059" style="s2">there&#39;s more of us up to an hour I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.049" end="00:07:02.969" style="s2">I would say yeah I think that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.059" end="00:07:07.069" style="s2">all right sounds good we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.969" end="00:07:10.919" style="s2">be Joe Rogan why not why not come on</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.069" end="00:07:12.839" style="s2">five hours of let&#39;s just let&#39;s just hash</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.919" end="00:07:15.659" style="s2">this out which is great we end up going</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.839" end="00:07:16.619" style="s2">that that on Fridays we went over our</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.659" end="00:07:20.159" style="s2">hour for sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.619" end="00:07:24.629" style="s2">which is fine the time commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.159" end="00:07:25.799" style="s2">create that sure so what are you you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.629" end="00:07:27.059" style="s2">don&#39;t have stuff to commit to anything</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.799" end="00:07:29.189" style="s2">in the next week but what is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.059" end="00:07:30.599" style="s2">that is like what&#39;s a barrier what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.189" end="00:07:35.339" style="s2">something that is stopping you from</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.599" end="00:07:37.879" style="s2">moving forward just deciding what&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.339" end="00:07:40.349" style="s2">so of course as you know you know I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.879" end="00:07:42.899" style="s2">not bad traction for a while I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.349" end="00:07:45.299" style="s2">posting every I was listening to twice a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.899" end="00:07:48.329" style="s2">week on with the election sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.299" end="00:07:51.509" style="s2">discussing and showing people the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.329" end="00:07:54.719" style="s2">prototypes that are available and then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.509" end="00:07:56.309" style="s2">decided to move and that ended up taking</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.719" end="00:07:57.629" style="s2">a ferret my time and all the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.309" end="00:08:01.079" style="s2">involved in that and now that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.629" end="00:08:02.939" style="s2">done getting back into it before I</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.079" end="00:08:05.519" style="s2">stopped I did sort of actually finish</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.939" end="00:08:07.769" style="s2">out that part of it where I finished</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.519" end="00:08:10.139" style="s2">that portion of discussing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.769" end="00:08:12.059" style="s2">politician history prototype and so now</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.139" end="00:08:14.909" style="s2">my thing is trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.059" end="00:08:17.789" style="s2">comes next I got a few different ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.909" end="00:08:20.279" style="s2">and it&#39;s just sort of figuring out where</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.789" end="00:08:22.829" style="s2">the value is what actually seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.279" end="00:08:25.739" style="s2">might produce something that sort of I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.829" end="00:08:28.429" style="s2">guess did the the the most useful and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.739" end="00:08:31.319" style="s2">then actually started to work on that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.429" end="00:08:32.639" style="s2">all right I don&#39;t know if I can help you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.319" end="00:08:34.649" style="s2">with that but sometimes just discussing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.639" end="00:08:36.779" style="s2">it and hearing right things right gives</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.649" end="00:08:41.159" style="s2">you the okay here&#39;s the next the next</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.779" end="00:08:44.610" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t even I know so I had idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.159" end="00:08:46.589" style="s2">cafe I had everyone every week and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.610" end="00:08:48.809" style="s2">I struggled with with getting people to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.589" end="00:08:51.089" style="s2">that same timeslot and so I switched the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.809" end="00:08:54.089" style="s2">format so that I was finding one person</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.089" end="00:08:55.080" style="s2">picking a question finding a time and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.089" end="00:08:57.330" style="s2">then putting it out so that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.080" end="00:08:59.310" style="s2">and that format worked except that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.330" end="00:09:01.709" style="s2">stopped doing it like that I kind of cuz</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.310" end="00:09:03.089" style="s2">like I had this vision other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.709" end="00:09:06.570" style="s2">would be contact and be like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.089" end="00:09:08.100" style="s2">discuss X and that didn&#39;t happen so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.570" end="00:09:09.959" style="s2">have to keep reaching you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.100" end="00:09:12.690" style="s2">have to just own that I have to be like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.959" end="00:09:15.029" style="s2">okay this needs to be a bit of a prior a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.690" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">bit of a priority even though I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.029" end="00:09:18.660" style="s2">this global tech thing that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:19.649" style="s2">to create as well and that is what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:22.529" style="s2">been doing I&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.649" end="00:09:24.899" style="s2">conversations with B people and starting</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.529" end="00:09:26.790" style="s2">the Friday morning conversation and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.899" end="00:09:30.600" style="s2">want to be able to focus on both of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.790" end="00:09:33.060" style="s2">those things and so having how do I get</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.600" end="00:09:34.829" style="s2">people to the idea cafe how do I find</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.570" end="00:09:41.790" style="s2">because I need things to be easy and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.060" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">have a few ideas of how like today I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.690" end="00:09:52.829" style="s2">about projects and anything spammy on</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.170" end="00:09:55.320" style="s2">Saturdays and so I want to focus on on</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.829" end="00:09:56.850" style="s2">that I&#39;m also a little bit all over the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.320" end="00:09:58.769" style="s2">place at the idea cafe which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.850" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">think is a bad thing because I&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.769" end="00:10:03.630" style="s2">over the place like I&#39;ve had ones on</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.450" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">finding like literally any topic there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.850" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">also other topics like one of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:21.750" style="s2">is Kurdish right word and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:24.029" style="s2">they&#39;re going through a genocide right</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.750" end="00:10:26.010" style="s2">now and I reached out to him and asked</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.029" end="00:10:27.690" style="s2">like does he know anyone like I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.010" end="00:10:29.910" style="s2">participate in the conversation but like</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.690" end="00:10:32.130" style="s2">facilitating conversations between other</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.910" end="00:10:36.390" style="s2">people that are powerful they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.130" end="00:10:38.339" style="s2">anything to do with me how do how do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.390" end="00:10:40.290" style="s2">talk about about things that are that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.339" end="00:10:43.199" style="s2">are happening right now and are huge and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.290" end="00:10:45.750" style="s2">how do we witness that and like I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.199" end="00:10:47.459" style="s2">see how powerful it is to have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.750" end="00:10:49.350" style="s2">platform for a conversation that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.459" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s becoming our first project with</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.350" end="00:10:55.470" style="s2">together tech that we&#39;re creating the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:57.449" style="s2">platform for idea cafe but for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.470" end="00:10:58.829" style="s2">YouTube channel to get bigger and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.449" end="00:11:01.560" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of potential in it</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.829" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">because when I was doing it for those</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.560" end="00:11:06.300" style="s2">few weeks we grew from zero subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">to 30 subscribers which doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.300" end="00:11:08.670" style="s2">big but this channel has been up for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:10.019" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.670" end="00:11:11.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s taken me a long time to get a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.019" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">sixty subscribers and when I post</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.640" end="00:11:17.519" style="s2">something people watch like it&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:18.990" style="s2">about ten people watch it maybe that one</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.519" end="00:11:20.730" style="s2">has thirty people watch it every time</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">and the way that it&#39;s formatted it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.730" end="00:11:24.600" style="s2">just like you bring your influence</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:25.740" style="s2">because you&#39;re coming off of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.600" end="00:11:27.300" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.740" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">influence with you but you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.300" end="00:11:31.980" style="s2">it you&#39;re sharing it with everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:33.959" style="s2">and so I was also reaching out to people</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.980" end="00:11:36.149" style="s2">I enjoy watching on YouTube and people</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.959" end="00:11:38.910" style="s2">who are more influencers to ask them to</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.149" end="00:11:40.290" style="s2">come on idea cafe more in a video format</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.910" end="00:11:42.690" style="s2">and more so other people could find me</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.290" end="00:11:46.910" style="s2">but also possibly doing that more</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.690" end="00:11:48.990" style="s2">finding people that are more middle line</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.910" end="00:11:49.950" style="s2">influencers that aren&#39;t you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.990" end="00:11:52.709" style="s2">they don&#39;t have millions of subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.950" end="00:11:55.649" style="s2">but have like ten tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.709" end="00:11:57.750" style="s2">subscribers and asking about you okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.649" end="00:11:59.640" style="s2">it&#39;s more about the conversation and not</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.750" end="00:12:02.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not trying to build an audience but</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.640" end="00:12:04.709" style="s2">if that happens not to get mad about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.430" end="00:12:06.990" style="s2">no and that&#39;s why is the audience seems</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.709" end="00:12:10.380" style="s2">to be engaged because there&#39;s more views</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.990" end="00:12:15.149" style="s2">than on these ones and so having that be</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.380" end="00:12:17.699" style="s2">part of part of part of like how do I</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.149" end="00:12:18.899" style="s2">get people there how do i how do I do it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.699" end="00:12:20.250" style="s2">with it like I said within my</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.899" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">limitations of needing it to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.250" end="00:12:25.110" style="s2">stress-free and easy and finding the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.339" style="s2">next piece that gives me that that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.110" end="00:12:28.380" style="s2">what happens when I changed the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.339" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">iteration but then I was and I had three</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.380" end="00:12:32.010" style="s2">that week and I was like okay maybe also</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:33.930" style="s2">when I have three in a week almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.010" end="00:12:35.430" style="s2">saving them to be posted till the next</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.930" end="00:12:39.529" style="s2">week in the next week so that I always</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.430" end="00:12:41.790" style="s2">have one week so that it&#39;s it&#39;s constant</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.529" end="00:12:43.699" style="s2">there&#39;s also a piece like when I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.790" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">doing it live on at 11:00 a.m. on</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.699" end="00:12:47.790" style="s2">Wednesdays it&#39;s nice to have people</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.290" end="00:12:51.209" style="s2">watching and participating people more</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.790" end="00:12:54.630" style="s2">likely to watch live but also some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.209" end="00:12:56.519" style="s2">the conversations aren&#39;t is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.630" end="00:12:58.620" style="s2">for life and so having them without</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.519" end="00:13:00.660" style="s2">people commenting and then posting it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.620" end="00:13:02.820" style="s2">actually it&#39;s you know they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.660" end="00:13:04.260" style="s2">posted it&#39;s not like at the end you got</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.820" end="00:13:05.850" style="s2">to be like everyone else was</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.260" end="00:13:08.070" style="s2">participating too you don&#39;t then get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.850" end="00:13:09.750" style="s2">say it&#39;s not posted but it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.070" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">than having people watch it lives it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.750" end="00:13:15.300" style="s2">different feeling so I need to pick I</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.230" end="00:13:16.949" style="s2">need to pick which one which one it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.300" end="00:13:20.640" style="s2">and I think not live and then posting</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.949" end="00:13:22.470" style="s2">live makes no sense I think and also I</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.640" end="00:13:25.649" style="s2">as your audience gets</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.470" end="00:13:27.209" style="s2">it becomes more useful to do live</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.649" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">because if you want live because of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.209" end="00:13:31.319" style="s2">conversation obviously you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:34.470" style="s2">have more conversation if you go live</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.319" end="00:13:39.589" style="s2">and a thousand people see see that your</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.470" end="00:13:41.939" style="s2">live versus 30 yeah yeah I&#39;m like a big</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.589" end="00:13:45.889" style="s2">YouTube person I follow a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.939" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">fair number of channels on YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.889" end="00:13:50.129" style="s2">one person thinking of in particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:52.589" style="s2">always post you know on a certain day</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.129" end="00:13:54.060" style="s2">but then they go live on technically</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.589" end="00:13:56.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a different channel theirs but they</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.060" end="00:14:00.540" style="s2">go live randomly and everything done yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.310" end="00:14:02.699" style="s2">so they have the option to do that ya</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.540" end="00:14:05.100" style="s2">know and that&#39;s always that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.699" end="00:14:07.230" style="s2">the struggle is getting any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.100" end="00:14:09.089" style="s2">audience getting any kind ofor like you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.230" end="00:14:11.910" style="s2">are sharing influence and you are being</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.089" end="00:14:13.410" style="s2">able to like I get that when people look</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.910" end="00:14:14.279" style="s2">at idea cafe channel they&#39;re like why</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.410" end="00:14:15.810" style="s2">would I come on it there&#39;s 30</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.279" end="00:14:19.319" style="s2">subscribers and I&#39;m like right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.810" end="00:14:21.720" style="s2">brand new and it&#39;s about like having fun</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.319" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">what makes this enjoyable and they not</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.720" end="00:14:26.370" style="s2">ironic but the amazing thing about it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:27.509" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s been on it even people</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.370" end="00:14:28.740" style="s2">who are like I was super nervous I</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.509" end="00:14:30.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t think didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.740" end="00:14:32.279" style="s2">this was gonna go afterwards in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.839" end="00:14:33.750" style="s2">conversation because we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.279" end="00:14:35.610" style="s2">turns sharing for five minutes on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.750" end="00:14:36.779" style="s2">question and then we have an open</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.610" end="00:14:39.750" style="s2">discussion for the rest of the half an</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.779" end="00:14:41.670" style="s2">hour and they&#39;ve all basically said in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.750" end="00:14:43.370" style="s2">the conversation like this was fun like</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.670" end="00:14:48.120" style="s2">this is I want to do this again and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.370" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a piece of it too is keeping the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.120" end="00:14:51.720" style="s2">same people like reaching out to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.250" style="s2">same autistic people and then also</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.720" end="00:14:56.040" style="s2">finding other people right like like</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.250" end="00:14:57.329" style="s2">growing that conversation so that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.040" end="00:14:59.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have to keep finding new people</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.329" end="00:15:01.829" style="s2">but the audience will be will hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.790" end="00:15:04.100" style="s2">bring in new people so if you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.829" end="00:15:06.149" style="s2">Google you&#39;re searching for autistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.100" end="00:15:07.380" style="s2">contents and then you watch us you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.149" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">like I want to I want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.380" end="00:15:09.930" style="s2">right I want to be able to have those</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.300" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.930" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">then contacting contact I think the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.300" end="00:15:16.559" style="s2">truth is besides putting my email in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:19.439" style="s2">there I don&#39;t really know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.559" end="00:15:20.819" style="s2">contact on YouTube right like even like</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.439" end="00:15:23.160" style="s2">in my description I can put the email</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.819" end="00:15:24.360" style="s2">but I think people aren&#39;t as likely like</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.160" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">they just want to comment but that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.360" end="00:15:27.149" style="s2">can&#39;t comment with their email so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:30.059" style="s2">can&#39;t even reach out to them to be like</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.149" end="00:15:33.019" style="s2">yeah come participate so part of its</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.059" end="00:15:35.459" style="s2">those limitations yeah I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.019" end="00:15:37.110" style="s2">do that I mean like as</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.459" end="00:15:39.029" style="s2">you said YouTube comments I&#39;ve seen some</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.110" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">people try to reach out to channels fit</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.029" end="00:15:43.230" style="s2">that way right yes you can you know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:45.569" style="s2">post your Twitter and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.230" end="00:15:48.540" style="s2">and people can slide in your DMS but</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.569" end="00:15:51.749" style="s2">Matt that&#39;s true I have for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.540" end="00:15:53.399" style="s2">that that I do but here&#39;s my and I do do</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.749" end="00:15:55.379" style="s2">that but I also do that after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.399" end="00:15:56.490" style="s2">and I think doing it for the life Oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.379" end="00:15:58.019" style="s2">though if we&#39;re not going live it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.490" end="00:15:59.999" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter and that&#39;s a part of not</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.019" end="00:16:02.189" style="s2">going live to issues to being able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.999" end="00:16:03.720" style="s2">put in our full description before it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.189" end="00:16:07.800" style="s2">goes I&#39;ve liked before it goes public</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.720" end="00:16:12.179" style="s2">from private and then and then doing it</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.800" end="00:16:14.309" style="s2">that way makes make sense and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.179" end="00:16:27.809" style="s2">getting getting some ideas what to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.309" end="00:16:30.420" style="s2">for this coming week all right how about</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.809" end="00:16:33.779" style="s2">you what is your are you thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.420" end="00:16:36.990" style="s2">next next steps like you said yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.779" end="00:16:40.139" style="s2">so the next steps that I have in mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.990" end="00:16:44.040" style="s2">one is to start working on the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.139" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">election piece with the US election we</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.040" end="00:16:47.100" style="s2">were to say coming up when it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:50.449" style="s2">year away but I mean that takes more</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.100" end="00:16:52.619" style="s2">than a year so starting to build out the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.449" end="00:16:56.269" style="s2">election summary I mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.619" end="00:16:58.439" style="s2">especially useful on the Democratic side</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.269" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">where there&#39;s still a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.439" end="00:17:01.559" style="s2">candidates even though a couple people</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">who have dropped out I think it still</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.559" end="00:17:05.850" style="s2">might be 10 or more I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:07.319" style="s2">build that out and starting to figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.850" end="00:17:09.809" style="s2">out what common questions there are what</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.319" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">content is supporting it actually build</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.809" end="00:17:15.539" style="s2">the prototype like it would be for that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:17.370" style="s2">and actually you know it could be useful</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.539" end="00:17:21.539" style="s2">for some people but mostly it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.370" end="00:17:24.990" style="s2">approved the concept there is to work on</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.539" end="00:17:29.730" style="s2">the prototype for the article review is</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.990" end="00:17:32.580" style="s2">that sort of the postal the least far</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.730" end="00:17:34.500" style="s2">along and one of the harder things to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.580" end="00:17:37.380" style="s2">explain but also means more people</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.500" end="00:17:38.610" style="s2">involved because I&#39;m not a scientist and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.380" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">the end goal is to have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.610" end="00:17:42.299" style="s2">scientists on board that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:44.429" style="s2">you know figure out what would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.299" end="00:17:47.130" style="s2">involved in reviewing what could you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.429" end="00:17:49.139" style="s2">actually pull out and figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.130" end="00:17:49.660" style="s2">sections are what and what is this just</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.139" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.660" end="00:17:55.000" style="s2">was used to working with data and not</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:57.670" style="s2">you know science stuff that maybe I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.000" end="00:18:01.570" style="s2">misunderstand and then finally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.670" end="00:18:03.700" style="s2">working on the newer content for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.570" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">website and Facebook and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.700" end="00:18:10.090" style="s2">to explain this slight shift where up</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:12.910" style="s2">until maybe a week ago I had split whoop</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.090" end="00:18:14.520" style="s2">were collection into the three parts</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.910" end="00:18:16.870" style="s2">where it&#39;s the politician history</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.520" end="00:18:19.660" style="s2">election summary and then what I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.870" end="00:18:21.610" style="s2">just calling the discussion tool which I</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.660" end="00:18:26.380" style="s2">decided that last one was way too broad</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.610" end="00:18:28.150" style="s2">and split that out into article review</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.380" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">so like sort of at the lower level</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.150" end="00:18:33.160" style="s2">taking an individual piece of content</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:36.100" style="s2">like assigned to a scientific study or</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.160" end="00:18:37.780" style="s2">maybe even some legislation and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.100" end="00:18:39.130" style="s2">pulling it apart to see what is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.780" end="00:18:42.490" style="s2">actually saying and what do people say</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.130" end="00:18:45.310" style="s2">about these various parts and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.490" end="00:18:46.420" style="s2">eventually the topic overview or that</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.310" end="00:18:50.110" style="s2">could be taking that information</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.420" end="00:18:51.730" style="s2">something like that vaccines figuring</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.110" end="00:18:54.580" style="s2">out what sort of a discussion people</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.730" end="00:18:56.500" style="s2">want to have around vaccines but using</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.580" end="00:18:59.020" style="s2">those articles that have been reviewed</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.500" end="00:19:01.870" style="s2">and summarized as the basis for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.020" end="00:19:03.610" style="s2">conversation yeah this is my much less</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.870" end="00:19:06.130" style="s2">about what people can say about a topic</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.130" end="00:19:12.910" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually got stuff to to back up</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:16.360" style="s2">and so just the content make that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.910" end="00:19:19.390" style="s2">clearer because I think up until now the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.360" end="00:19:21.400" style="s2">content for talking about the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.390" end="00:19:22.540" style="s2">tool was just way too broad and people</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.400" end="00:19:25.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t really understand what I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.540" end="00:19:27.820" style="s2">going for which is I mean it is broad</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.180" end="00:19:29.820" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to have how to how to hone</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.820" end="00:19:32.980" style="s2">that down I know there are other</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.820" end="00:19:35.100" style="s2">discussion tools out there I can&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.980" end="00:19:36.520" style="s2">about their names right now Kyle oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.100" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">with their name</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.520" end="00:19:40.870" style="s2">okay I alo is what&#39;s coming up in my</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:43.870" style="s2">brain where it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.870" end="00:19:45.220" style="s2">like a pro/con like okay this topic and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.870" end="00:19:47.650" style="s2">then you kind of pro/con and then you go</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.220" end="00:19:49.380" style="s2">off into pro-kit like yes no and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.650" end="00:19:52.990" style="s2">yes no on the yes/no is kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.380" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">like a branch discussion there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.990" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">discussion tools out there but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:20:01.990" style="s2">not gonna be attached to yours right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:03.429" style="s2">is there a beta version of just the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.990" end="00:20:06.999" style="s2">political piece</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.429" end="00:20:09.129" style="s2">that can be launched and with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.999" end="00:20:12.009" style="s2">of like hey we want we want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.129" end="00:20:13.659" style="s2">to add discussions to this using any of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.009" end="00:20:15.009" style="s2">the ones that are out there which I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.659" end="00:20:16.419" style="s2">don&#39;t know all of them and people keeper</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.009" end="00:20:18.309" style="s2">like did you hear about this project in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.419" end="00:20:19.899" style="s2">this project I&#39;m like yes and no because</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.309" end="00:20:22.659" style="s2">I can&#39;t keep them all in my brain like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.899" end="00:20:24.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t I need a way to that&#39;s why I want</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.659" end="00:20:25.749" style="s2">they like Yelp for apps which was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.190" end="00:20:27.519" style="s2">be possibly one of our first projects</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.749" end="00:20:31.450" style="s2">together Tech and I think it will</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.519" end="00:20:33.219" style="s2">naturally become a project where just</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.450" end="00:20:35.049" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s out there knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.219" end="00:20:37.839" style="s2">apps exist whether they&#39;re from the big</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.049" end="00:20:39.909" style="s2">tech giants or they&#39;re from a small</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.839" end="00:20:41.830" style="s2">group of coders or not-for-profit or our</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.909" end="00:20:45.099" style="s2">tech company that I&#39;m created that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.830" end="00:20:47.109" style="s2">cooperative we&#39;re creating show Casey</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.099" end="00:20:49.659" style="s2">and like what is it they do how well do</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.109" end="00:20:52.570" style="s2">they do it and then contact information</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.659" end="00:20:54.489" style="s2">so that like people who have had those</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.570" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">sites right and that might be like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.489" end="00:20:58.149" style="s2">we can reach out to people who have</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:01.450" style="s2">those discussions sites and say hey want</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.149" end="00:21:03.759" style="s2">to come on and discuss what it was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.450" end="00:21:06.639" style="s2">to create that right what was it like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.759" end="00:21:08.019" style="s2">create that tool and I assume most of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.639" end="00:21:10.419" style="s2">those people are in it for purpose</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.019" end="00:21:11.649" style="s2">instead of profit necessarily even if</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.419" end="00:21:12.999" style="s2">they now have to also of course make</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.649" end="00:21:14.529" style="s2">profit and maybe I&#39;m wrong and they</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.999" end="00:21:16.749" style="s2">don&#39;t they don&#39;t want to come out or 60</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.529" end="00:21:17.259" style="s2">subscribe our channel but doesn&#39;t hurt</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.749" end="00:21:19.570" style="s2">to try</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.259" end="00:21:24.700" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t hurt to ask me what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.570" end="00:21:29.229" style="s2">yeah if you can get one that one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.700" end="00:21:30.339" style="s2">and if they&#39;re you know I think when we</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.229" end="00:21:32.289" style="s2">do this for a few weeks and have other</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.339" end="00:21:33.700" style="s2">people join us other people who have</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.289" end="00:21:34.779" style="s2">tech projects if you missed the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.700" end="00:21:36.759" style="s2">beginning of this we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.779" end="00:21:38.619" style="s2">other people who have a tech project</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.759" end="00:21:42.849" style="s2">that is for purpose instead of profit</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.619" end="00:21:44.679" style="s2">over a profit and want to be working</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.849" end="00:21:47.499" style="s2">through that project together to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.679" end="00:21:48.879" style="s2">brainstorm to make goals and and move</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.499" end="00:21:51.639" style="s2">forward and the more we have people</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.879" end="00:21:53.589" style="s2">who&#39;ve had them in the past have tech</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.639" end="00:21:55.809" style="s2">projects currently have had successful</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.589" end="00:21:57.190" style="s2">ones then the more were you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.809" end="00:21:59.169" style="s2">everyone knows everyone it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.190" end="00:22:01.570" style="s2">small group and you know like it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.909" end="00:22:07.929" style="s2">connections to be a better networker</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.379" end="00:22:09.519" style="s2">like I wish I could remember that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.929" end="00:22:13.299" style="s2">well you were talking about scientist I</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.519" end="00:22:16.299" style="s2">was like I know scientists I went to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.299" end="00:22:18.399" style="s2">school with many scientists and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.299" end="00:22:21.279" style="s2">if you write up if that is the piece you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.399" end="00:22:22.690" style="s2">want to move forward with then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.279" end="00:22:25.029" style="s2">moving forward with that piece if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.690" end="00:22:26.919" style="s2">want to talk to scientists I and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.029" end="00:22:28.869" style="s2">write something out I can take them on</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.919" end="00:22:30.489" style="s2">Facebook or I can send it directly to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.869" end="00:22:32.769" style="s2">her in there</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.769" end="00:22:37.690" style="s2">you&#39;re doing currently but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.749" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">everyone I worked with in the lab I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.690" end="00:22:42.849" style="s2">I can talk to you and say even just</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:46.089" style="s2">going to the University and literally</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.849" end="00:22:48.009" style="s2">walking around the University in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.089" end="00:22:50.499" style="s2">science department and saying like hey I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.009" end="00:22:51.940" style="s2">would like to find out like on most of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.499" end="00:22:54.759" style="s2">their doors they have posted with her</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.940" end="00:22:57.729" style="s2">their TA hours are and nobody nobody</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.759" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">shows up to them except during finals so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.729" end="00:23:01.779" style="s2">if you could show up to their open hours</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:03.700" style="s2">to TA is even right like they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.779" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">to be the person whose names on the lab</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.700" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">but saying hey I&#39;d like to discuss this</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:10.269" style="s2">and they will love just most of the bowl</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.489" style="s2">of students because you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.269" end="00:23:14.589" style="s2">them on scientific terms and saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.489" end="00:23:16.269" style="s2">what do you think would be in this right</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.589" end="00:23:18.190" style="s2">and if you have I&#39;m not I could have</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.269" end="00:23:19.659" style="s2">those conversations but I don&#39;t know we</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.190" end="00:23:20.669" style="s2">both live in the state I was like in</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.659" end="00:23:24.009" style="s2">Kamloops</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.669" end="00:23:26.169" style="s2">if you come we can go out to UBC with</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.009" end="00:23:27.820" style="s2">you and be part of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.169" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">because I might no I don&#39;t think I could</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.820" end="00:23:31.419" style="s2">have that conversation by myself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:33.609" style="s2">actually when I was going through</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.419" end="00:23:35.679" style="s2">groundswell I was trying to do a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.609" end="00:23:37.959" style="s2">project and I went and talked to one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.679" end="00:23:39.129" style="s2">my old professors to say hey what are</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.959" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">these questions and how would this look</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.129" end="00:23:43.959" style="s2">like she was very open she said but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:47.619" style="s2">if we walk around and see who&#39;s who has</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.959" end="00:23:49.539" style="s2">hours what they&#39;re okay and they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.619" end="00:23:50.979" style="s2">fine with the fact that I don&#39;t go there</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.539" end="00:23:54.190" style="s2">have never gone there have no both</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.979" end="00:23:55.869" style="s2">secondary they&#39;re just yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.190" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">you&#39;re a tech person right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.869" end="00:24:00.820" style="s2">creating tech yeah I I don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:02.229" style="s2">those things I have a university degree</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.820" end="00:24:05.109" style="s2">and everyone I know who has what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.229" end="00:24:06.849" style="s2">like having one is basically just</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.109" end="00:24:07.989" style="s2">knowing what you don&#39;t know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.849" end="00:24:11.769" style="s2">you already know what you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.989" end="00:24:13.329" style="s2">you&#39;re good like okay the see of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.769" end="00:24:13.979" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t possibly understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.329" end="00:24:16.839" style="s2">gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.979" end="00:24:18.459" style="s2">so we all have to be and they know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.839" end="00:24:20.349" style="s2">right like that&#39;s what going they have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.459" end="00:24:22.989" style="s2">specialty it&#39;s like this is my specialty</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.349" end="00:24:24.549" style="s2">and but understanding scientific papers</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.989" end="00:24:28.050" style="s2">and understanding what that what that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.549" end="00:24:30.180" style="s2">is is huge</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.050" end="00:24:33.450" style="s2">that&#39;s good to know that does sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.180" end="00:24:35.190" style="s2">lean on maybe working on the content</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.450" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit more important just so that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.190" end="00:24:37.590" style="s2">can kind of explain it and there you</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:38.730" style="s2">know there&#39;s two or three images to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.590" end="00:24:40.380" style="s2">like hey here&#39;s the stuff that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.730" end="00:24:43.500" style="s2">talking about mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.380" end="00:24:45.180" style="s2">also maybe the the prototype for that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.500" end="00:24:46.590" style="s2">like early days they&#39;re not really very</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.180" end="00:24:48.750" style="s2">interactive because it needs a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.590" end="00:24:51.090" style="s2">things created to really like dissect</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.150" end="00:25:21.030" style="s2">specific questions that need to get</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.900" end="00:26:03.960" style="s2">something I didn&#39;t hear back that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.920" end="00:26:05.220" style="s2">assumed yeah they probably get a fair</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.960" end="00:26:08.370" style="s2">number of questions and people randomly</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.220" end="00:26:12.060" style="s2">reaching out and also that was fairly</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.370" end="00:26:15.030" style="s2">early days yeah it would be actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.060" end="00:26:16.920" style="s2">awesome to um I love giving other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.030" end="00:26:18.360" style="s2">work because I would never to put like</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.920" end="00:26:19.100" style="s2">an advertisement together right like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.360" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">little brochure</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.100" end="00:26:24.330" style="s2">prints out 100 copies or whatever go go</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:25.650" style="s2">to UBC it handed out at the poly side</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.330" end="00:26:28.380" style="s2">place and say hey is this a project</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.650" end="00:26:29.790" style="s2">you&#39;d want to be in on and and then do</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.380" end="00:26:32.430" style="s2">the TA thing like go to them and say</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.790" end="00:26:34.020" style="s2">maybe just give them the paper but then</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.430" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">also if there&#39;s like a random student</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.020" end="00:26:38.930" style="s2">who happens to be there for the TA hours</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">which it&#39;s like a unicorn event Oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.930" end="00:26:44.910" style="s2">unless things have changed the last time</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s the weird part because</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.910" end="00:26:48.840" style="s2">we&#39;re so electronic right even our</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:52.770" style="s2">projects are electronic reach you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.840" end="00:26:55.380" style="s2">via email is so cold and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.770" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">go and get warm warm contact where</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.380" end="00:26:59.340" style="s2">you&#39;re like I&#39;m a human being who cares</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:00.929" style="s2">about things too and I&#39;m in it you you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.340" end="00:27:03.030" style="s2">can see that they&#39;re in it for purpose</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.929" end="00:27:05.490" style="s2">even if they&#39;re in it for profit too</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.030" end="00:27:06.570" style="s2">right like like they&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.490" end="00:27:08.160" style="s2">gonna care that you&#39;re in it for profit</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.570" end="00:27:10.140" style="s2">they&#39;re like what I am BG for</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.160" end="00:27:11.429" style="s2">politicians yes that needs to exist and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.140" end="00:27:13.920" style="s2">they might know of ones that have</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.429" end="00:27:15.720" style="s2">already existed contact those people and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.920" end="00:27:19.350" style="s2">find out because you know they have and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.720" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">find out but they are things that like</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.350" end="00:27:23.400" style="s2">are closed up when I first launched my</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:24.690" style="s2">Kickstarter I got a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.400" end="00:27:26.400" style="s2">about that have you checked this have</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.690" end="00:27:28.260" style="s2">you checked that out and most of them I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.400" end="00:27:29.880" style="s2">had and you know I still didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.260" end="00:27:31.620" style="s2">that they were quite where I thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.880" end="00:27:33.210" style="s2">they needed them to be but it was cool</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.620" end="00:27:34.860" style="s2">to see people were at least that engaged</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.210" end="00:27:36.420" style="s2">and there were a couple that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.860" end="00:27:39.150" style="s2">heard of that I went and looked at and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.420" end="00:27:40.710" style="s2">today every cool and yeah getting an</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.150" end="00:27:42.990" style="s2">intro to something like that even if it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.710" end="00:27:45.540" style="s2">was just somebody who was you know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.990" end="00:27:47.309" style="s2">a user that posted a lot of stuff on</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.540" end="00:27:50.429" style="s2">those apps but still be useful yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.309" end="00:27:52.110" style="s2">remembering now that I&#39;ve been graduated</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.429" end="00:27:54.600" style="s2">for almost 20 years in a while but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.110" end="00:27:57.240" style="s2">like all these people who are in Poli</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.600" end="00:28:01.530" style="s2">Sci or who are in science and Poli</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.240" end="00:28:03.420" style="s2">science are also extreme social media</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.530" end="00:28:05.190" style="s2">people probably right like they probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.420" end="00:28:06.990" style="s2">can do that piece of it can probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.190" end="00:28:10.350" style="s2">find the marketing that you and I maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.990" end="00:28:12.120" style="s2">aren&#39;t aren&#39;t the best at and if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.350" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">have those people on board right like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.120" end="00:28:17.280" style="s2">the next kickstarter you do has power</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:19.830" style="s2">behind it right they might already be</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.280" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">influencers on Instagram and Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.830" end="00:28:23.490" style="s2">and doing those things but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:26.040" style="s2">just if they you know if it happens to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.490" end="00:28:29.370" style="s2">be that way right the 20 year olds that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.040" end="00:28:31.110" style="s2">Susan University like it&#39;s like grew up</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.370" end="00:28:37.470" style="s2">with the internet like they were born in</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.110" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">2000 Adriel so we&#39;re coming up to 30</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.470" end="00:28:43.100" style="s2">minutes do we want to say what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:46.679" style="s2">committed to doing for the next week</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.100" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">sure so it sounds like I&#39;d want to build</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.679" end="00:28:54.120" style="s2">up the content start being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:55.080" style="s2">those in-person conversations I doubt it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.120" end="00:28:56.850" style="s2">will be ready</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.080" end="00:28:58.169" style="s2">but and because that&#39;s actually a fair</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.850" end="00:29:00.210" style="s2">amount of stuff but at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.169" end="00:29:02.070" style="s2">have a better idea on what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.210" end="00:29:03.779" style="s2">content is needed and have the framework</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.070" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">and then possibly talk about that and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.779" end="00:29:08.519" style="s2">maybe some really basic mock-ups just to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:11.700" style="s2">sort of say does that make sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.519" end="00:29:13.739" style="s2">not you know it would it would be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.700" end="00:29:14.639" style="s2">it&#39;s just to sort of say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.739" end="00:29:17.820" style="s2">basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.639" end="00:29:21.480" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t make sense to you is your you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.820" end="00:29:23.909" style="s2">know as you said one of them scientists</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.480" end="00:29:25.980" style="s2">and somebody who&#39;s not super close to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.909" end="00:29:28.980" style="s2">the you know down in the weeds part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.980" end="00:29:31.109" style="s2">the project which in this case is good</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.980" end="00:29:32.700" style="s2">because it means you know you already</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.109" end="00:29:34.470" style="s2">know more about it than they would but</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.700" end="00:29:36.029" style="s2">if it makes sense to you and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.470" end="00:29:40.440" style="s2">it&#39;ll be more likely to make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.029" end="00:29:42.419" style="s2">them yeah sounds cool um when I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.440" end="00:29:45.720" style="s2">doing life coaching and stuff and doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.419" end="00:29:47.580" style="s2">this with like people not outside of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.720" end="00:29:49.320" style="s2">tech we had what were called SMART goals</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.580" end="00:29:51.659" style="s2">which were specific measurable</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.320" end="00:29:53.759" style="s2">attainable realistic and time-based this</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.659" end="00:29:55.739" style="s2">is not that right cuz you could I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.759" end="00:29:58.169" style="s2">know we want to make them SMART goals as</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.739" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">far as that just means like I will work</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.169" end="00:30:01.859" style="s2">on this for three hours by next Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:03.149" style="s2">right like it just means cuz I we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.859" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">gonna know whether to check this off or</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.149" end="00:30:06.539" style="s2">not because it&#39;s like move forward a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:07.710" style="s2">little bit right if you&#39;re good with</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.539" end="00:30:09.539" style="s2">that I&#39;m good with that because I might</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.710" end="00:30:13.320" style="s2">be how am i some of my goals are but do</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.539" end="00:30:16.559" style="s2">you want to put a um something on them</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.320" end="00:30:18.419" style="s2">like well um sure yeah we can say I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.559" end="00:30:20.850" style="s2">think three hours actually sounds good</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.590" end="00:30:30.419" style="s2">building out more content for three</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.909" end="00:30:32.669" style="s2">hours between now and then geared</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.419" end="00:30:35.009" style="s2">towards having those in person</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.669" end="00:30:38.190" style="s2">discussions and starting to actually you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.009" end="00:30:40.429" style="s2">know get people at various universities</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.190" end="00:30:43.769" style="s2">involved in both sides of the project</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.429" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">okay perfect um and that&#39;s that you&#39;re</p>
