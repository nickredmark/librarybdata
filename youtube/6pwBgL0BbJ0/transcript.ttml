<p begin="00:00:18.340" end="00:00:23.470" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis last</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.950" end="00:00:26.200" style="s2">time we were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.470" end="00:00:30.310" style="s2">historical developments that happened</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.200" end="00:00:31.539" style="s2">around caught we took a look at Conte</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.310" end="00:00:34.270" style="s2">and Schopenhauer</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.539" end="00:00:37.120" style="s2">and Nietzsche and I presented Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.270" end="00:00:38.590" style="s2">as one of the great prophets I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.120" end="00:00:42.040" style="s2">that in the Old Testament sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.590" end="00:00:46.210" style="s2">prophet of the meaning crisis and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.040" end="00:00:47.800" style="s2">talked about a way of understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.210" end="00:00:51.160" style="s2">Nietzsche is saying now it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.800" end="00:00:54.430" style="s2">simply atheism and we also took a look</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.160" end="00:00:58.210" style="s2">at way in which Michi doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.430" end="00:01:00.120" style="s2">adequately give us a response to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.210" end="00:01:03.370" style="s2">meaning crisis although he indicates</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.120" end="00:01:05.649" style="s2">that an important project within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.370" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">response to the meaning crisis is how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.649" end="00:01:14.940" style="s2">we reappropriation legacy the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">radical self transcendence within a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.940" end="00:01:21.790" style="s2">secular scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:23.409" style="s2">now I want to go back to Kant and trace</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.790" end="00:01:25.299" style="s2">out another important line of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.409" end="00:01:27.100" style="s2">development that&#39;s going to be crucial</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.299" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">for understanding the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.100" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the line that comes from Conte</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:38.860" style="s2">and to Hegel I can&#39;t go through all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:41.650" style="s2">various important German thinkers like</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.860" end="00:01:43.450" style="s2">Victor and Schelling but I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.650" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">a lot about Hegel because of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.450" end="00:01:50.619" style="s2">tremendous impact how Hegel has had on</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:52.420" style="s2">the political landscape and the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.619" end="00:01:56.860" style="s2">landscape surrounding the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.420" end="00:01:59.290" style="s2">and as we know Kant also had a deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.860" end="00:02:02.350" style="s2">influence on the romantics who also have</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.290" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">a significant impact on Hegel so if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.350" end="00:02:09.040" style="s2">remember Conte as this model of the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">the mind is framing reality in order to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.040" end="00:02:20.680" style="s2">produce what is rational within it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:22.599" style="s2">that this was then taken by the Romantic</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.680" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">stand and reversed in an in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.599" end="00:02:27.560" style="s2">interesting way that the closer you got</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">to the actual con</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.560" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">reestablishing in the contact with</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:35.189" style="s2">reality the more you&#39;re reversing this</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">process of rationalization and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.189" end="00:02:43.079" style="s2">coming into contact with reality via</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:45.180" style="s2">more irrational states of mind and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.079" end="00:02:47.959" style="s2">Kant had of course is the idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.180" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">reality out here was the thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.959" end="00:02:55.109" style="s2">which we cannot directly interact with</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">we can only interact with our experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.109" end="00:03:00.329" style="s2">you see how the the disconnection from</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:03.269" style="s2">the world becomes radicalized and caught</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.329" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">and all the meaning is totally within a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.269" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">self enclosed activity a self</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:11.340" style="s2">constructed self constructing self</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:13.859" style="s2">enclosed activity of the mind right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:15.629" style="s2">the thing in here the thing in itself is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.859" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">nothing that we can come into rational</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.629" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">contact with and that&#39;s why of course as</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:23.819" style="s2">I said the romantics proposed this</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:25.859" style="s2">radical idea sort of the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.819" end="00:03:28.379" style="s2">of the actual revolution that by moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.859" end="00:03:30.030" style="s2">into more irrational states we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.379" end="00:03:34.079" style="s2">reestablish contact with reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.030" end="00:03:37.650" style="s2">now Hegel is aware of both the romantic</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.079" end="00:03:39.739" style="s2">response and the contine framework and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.650" end="00:03:43.530" style="s2">talking about hey goes from oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.739" end="00:03:45.030" style="s2">Hegel is a Titanic and complex and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.530" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">difficult thinker and so once again I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.030" end="00:03:51.230" style="s2">want to remind everybody that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">to cut through a lot of material in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.230" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">trying to zero in on those aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:03:59.669" style="s2">Hegel&#39;s thought that are I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.910" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">directly relevant to understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.669" end="00:04:04.919" style="s2">genealogy of the meaning crisis so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:09.199" style="s2">Hegel says first of all is that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.919" end="00:04:12.569" style="s2">idea makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.199" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">Hegel points out that the thing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.569" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">itself is completely unknowable and for</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">something to be completely unknowable he</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">argues is indistinguishable from it</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">being non-existent there is nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:28.979" style="s2">can possibly be knowing about it right</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">then we should stop thinking about it as</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.979" end="00:04:34.919" style="s2">something that exists something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">should be taken into account when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.919" end="00:04:39.300" style="s2">talking about a relationship to reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">and if you remove the thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.300" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">then you get this idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">that reality is totally found within</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:48.810" style="s2">this structure this is of course a form</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">of idealism which has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.810" end="00:04:55.230" style="s2">pursuing ideal idealism is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:05:00.570" style="s2">reality is ultimately constructed made</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.230" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">by the mind in some fashion and so Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.570" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">makes the famous claim that the real is</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">the rational that this rational stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:12.660" style="s2">and reality are actually identical if</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:15.390" style="s2">you get rid of this side of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.660" end="00:05:20.010" style="s2">the thing in itself all you&#39;re left with</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.390" end="00:05:22.170" style="s2">is this that reality is the rational the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.010" end="00:05:25.170" style="s2">real is the rational and the rational is</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:28.380" style="s2">the real and this of course is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.170" end="00:05:30.390" style="s2">important derivation I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.380" end="00:05:32.730" style="s2">correct way of putting it from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.390" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">original insight from Parmenides that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.730" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">saw exemplified in Plato that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:41.790" style="s2">deep connection between being and being</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:44.610" style="s2">known that there&#39;s a deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.790" end="00:05:46.470" style="s2">between our sensing something as real</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.610" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean just physically sensing</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.470" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">I mean making sense are sensing</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:56.180" style="s2">something as real and how intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">it is to us how knowable it is to us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.180" end="00:06:02.520" style="s2">pearl in his book thinking being the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:06.750" style="s2">classical addition to metaphysics just</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.520" end="00:06:10.680" style="s2">does a fantastic job at explaining how</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.750" end="00:06:14.700" style="s2">profoundly fecund this idea has been for</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.680" end="00:06:18.060" style="s2">us so Hegel takes that Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.700" end="00:06:20.850" style="s2">inspiration and he he weds it to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.060" end="00:06:23.910" style="s2">critique of the thing in itself and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.850" end="00:06:28.170" style="s2">we get this idea that what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.910" end="00:06:31.440" style="s2">going on actually is not just not that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.170" end="00:06:34.230" style="s2">the mind like in kata is making the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.440" end="00:06:36.600" style="s2">structures of rational experience of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.230" end="00:06:39.030" style="s2">reality no no you get the DES mind is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.600" end="00:06:43.080" style="s2">actually making the structures of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.030" end="00:06:45.420" style="s2">reality itself well what about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.080" end="00:06:48.230" style="s2">irrational stuff that the romantics were</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.420" end="00:06:50.510" style="s2">talking about well he go sort of re</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.230" end="00:06:53.670" style="s2">understands and reinterprets these</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.510" end="00:06:56.640" style="s2">developmentally he understands</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.670" end="00:07:00.180" style="s2">the irrational aspects of the mind right</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.640" end="00:07:02.550" style="s2">not as us moving towards the contact</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.180" end="00:07:05.490" style="s2">with the unknowable thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.550" end="00:07:08.790" style="s2">instead the irrational aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.490" end="00:07:11.720" style="s2">mind are actually a potential within the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.790" end="00:07:15.720" style="s2">mind a developmental potential for</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.720" end="00:07:19.470" style="s2">rationality so the idea is are rational</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.720" end="00:07:22.020" style="s2">in intelligible experience it has not</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.470" end="00:07:24.980" style="s2">fully developed has not been fully self</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.020" end="00:07:28.250" style="s2">actualized and you can hear the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.980" end="00:07:30.840" style="s2">Aristotelian aspects in Hegel&#39;s thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.250" end="00:07:32.280" style="s2">now when I start talking about mind in</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.840" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">this way and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.280" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">they have to be very careful we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">talking about mind um in a sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:43.200" style="s2">your mind in the individual mind we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:46.590" style="s2">talking about mind in an extended sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.200" end="00:07:49.560" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the entire system of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.590" end="00:07:53.760" style="s2">patterns of intelligibility that are at</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.560" end="00:07:56.640" style="s2">work in humanity all of the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.760" end="00:08:02.190" style="s2">intelligibility that we&#39;re using to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.640" end="00:08:04.320" style="s2">sense in this profound way so if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.190" end="00:08:06.630" style="s2">think about this room for example and my</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.320" end="00:08:10.980" style="s2">mind is structuring my experience and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.630" end="00:08:12.930" style="s2">then if you give Hegel his critique of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.980" end="00:08:15.810" style="s2">content there&#39;s nothing beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.930" end="00:08:20.040" style="s2">structuring of experience then you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.810" end="00:08:22.260" style="s2">the idea that this is all in sense in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.040" end="00:08:25.020" style="s2">deeply metaphysical sense this is all</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.260" end="00:08:26.580" style="s2">the activity of these patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.020" end="00:08:29.790" style="s2">intelligibility the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.580" end="00:08:35.430" style="s2">intelligibility and reality are this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.790" end="00:08:36.690" style="s2">this mind in this extended sense so try</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.430" end="00:08:39.210" style="s2">to think of these patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.690" end="00:08:43.350" style="s2">intelligibility as structuring reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.210" end="00:08:46.140" style="s2">not just the experience of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.350" end="00:08:48.570" style="s2">that they form a living system they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.140" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">developing like an era Staller it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.570" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">a living thing they&#39;re going through a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:54.450" style="s2">process of self actualization the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:08:56.450" style="s2">irrational elements are constantly being</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:08:59.490" style="s2">transformed into more rational</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.450" end="00:09:01.290" style="s2">intelligible elements so the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.490" end="00:09:04.860" style="s2">have a great word for all of this the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.290" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">word Geist and like all German words it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.860" end="00:09:10.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t translate that readily into</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:14.620" style="s2">English it covers these two words that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.840" end="00:09:17.740" style="s2">we separate in English and it overlaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.620" end="00:09:19.660" style="s2">between them mind and spirit because</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.740" end="00:09:22.270" style="s2">what it&#39;s trying to pick up on again</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.660" end="00:09:24.820" style="s2">this living systems of patterns and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.270" end="00:09:27.940" style="s2">intelligibility by which we all timidly</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.820" end="00:09:31.510" style="s2">make sense and given this argument</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.940" end="00:09:34.030" style="s2">against a renewable reality being a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.510" end="00:09:37.000" style="s2">reality then the patterns by making</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.030" end="00:09:42.270" style="s2">sense are identical to the patterns by</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.000" end="00:09:42.270" style="s2">which reality is intelligibly structured</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.020" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">so this is an individual idealism this</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.180" end="00:09:52.390" style="s2">is what&#39;s going to become known as</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:55.540" style="s2">absolute idealism because the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.390" end="00:10:00.490" style="s2">is another term that&#39;s used for this</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.540" end="00:10:02.530" style="s2">system of self realization of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:05.620" style="s2">patterns of intelligibility rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.530" end="00:10:07.570" style="s2">talking about an individual mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.620" end="00:10:09.700" style="s2">trying not to get too abstract here but</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.570" end="00:10:10.630" style="s2">it&#39;s hard not to be abstract when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.700" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.630" end="00:10:15.940" style="s2">Hegel&#39;s idealism and so my task with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:19.210" style="s2">is to try and explain this in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.940" end="00:10:21.700" style="s2">constantly makes it plausible to you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.210" end="00:10:23.500" style="s2">also at least viable so you can see why</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.700" end="00:10:27.400" style="s2">it became an attractive way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.500" end="00:10:30.040" style="s2">if you deeply by Conte and the Romantics</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.400" end="00:10:32.650" style="s2">and yet you accept Hegel&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.040" end="00:10:36.490" style="s2">against this you reinterpret the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.650" end="00:10:40.150" style="s2">romantics the way he did you get this</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.490" end="00:10:43.150" style="s2">position how do you study it how do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.150" end="00:10:45.700" style="s2">understand it how do you study this</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.150" end="00:10:48.630" style="s2">living systems of patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.700" end="00:10:52.110" style="s2">intelligibility that structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.630" end="00:10:57.730" style="s2">experience and reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.110" end="00:10:59.560" style="s2">well you study history and here you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.730" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">see of course the deep influence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.560" end="00:11:05.850" style="s2">Christianity and going back to the axial</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:08.950" style="s2">revolution within ancient Israel about</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.850" end="00:11:12.190" style="s2">understanding history as the process by</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.950" end="00:11:17.500" style="s2">which reality and our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.190" end="00:11:19.570" style="s2">reality are Co unfolding together so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.500" end="00:11:20.500" style="s2">study history and you look for patterns</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.570" end="00:11:23.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.500" end="00:11:26.710" style="s2">right the history what are you looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.560" end="00:11:28.450" style="s2">what kind of patterns right these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.710" end="00:11:33.550" style="s2">patterns in how we have systematically</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.450" end="00:11:40.690" style="s2">made sense how cultures have created</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.550" end="00:11:44.680" style="s2">world views ways of making sense ways in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.690" end="00:11:47.110" style="s2">which we have as I&#39;ve often used the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.680" end="00:11:50.050" style="s2">metaphor we&#39;ve created grammars by which</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.110" end="00:11:52.510" style="s2">we make sense of ourselves and the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.050" end="00:11:54.670" style="s2">so you can see some of the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:57.400" style="s2">Hegel on some of the terms and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.670" end="00:12:02.710" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been using as we&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.400" end="00:12:06.220" style="s2">engaging in our historical analysis okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.710" end="00:12:07.870" style="s2">so these are patterns we realize and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.220" end="00:12:10.450" style="s2">want to really pick up on the double</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.870" end="00:12:14.440" style="s2">meaning of this word like alright I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.450" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">indicated before when realizing means</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.440" end="00:12:19.960" style="s2">here both that it is something we</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:23.080" style="s2">experience but it is also a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.960" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">things are being made real coming into</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.080" end="00:12:32.170" style="s2">realness coming into reality in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:35.260" style="s2">developmental sense so we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.170" end="00:12:37.840" style="s2">about looking at history to discover the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.260" end="00:12:39.850" style="s2">development of this grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.840" end="00:12:43.780" style="s2">intelligibility this grammar of human</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.850" end="00:12:46.390" style="s2">thinking human being human living how</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.780" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">humans are world Inge how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.390" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">creating worlds of of intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.550" end="00:12:56.050" style="s2">patterns in which we can act in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:58.120" style="s2">meaningfully meaningful manner and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.050" end="00:13:01.840" style="s2">understand ourselves the world in each</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.120" end="00:13:05.380" style="s2">other and what you discover Hegel said</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.840" end="00:13:07.180" style="s2">is if you look at this history you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.380" end="00:13:09.460" style="s2">see it&#39;s not static you can see that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.180" end="00:13:11.650" style="s2">is going through a developmental process</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.460" end="00:13:17.020" style="s2">and that development is driven by sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.650" end="00:13:21.570" style="s2">of two opposing movements or forces one</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.020" end="00:13:21.570" style="s2">is a process of differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.740" end="00:13:36.860" style="s2">so think about when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.390" end="00:13:40.380" style="s2">make sense what do you have to do often</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.860" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">right you have to grasp the differences</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.380" end="00:13:46.400" style="s2">between things you have to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:48.690" style="s2">you have to clarify you have to contrast</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.400" end="00:13:51.410" style="s2">so what a good way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.690" end="00:13:53.460" style="s2">this is this term we use articulation</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.410" end="00:13:55.740" style="s2">articulation means to speak and to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.460" end="00:13:58.380" style="s2">sense but it also means to find all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.740" end="00:14:01.770" style="s2">joints find the division points between</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.380" end="00:14:05.700" style="s2">things so part of what we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.770" end="00:14:07.950" style="s2">is when we&#39;re trying to make sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.700" end="00:14:10.380" style="s2">engaging in a process of differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.950" end="00:14:14.930" style="s2">articulation but of course we also are</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.380" end="00:14:22.440" style="s2">doing the other right we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.930" end="00:14:26.760" style="s2">integration we are gathering things</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.440" end="00:14:29.700" style="s2">together so that we have systematic</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.760" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">connections are being realized</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.700" end="00:14:33.510" style="s2">again it&#39;s we&#39;re not we&#39;re becoming</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:35.400" style="s2">aware of them but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.510" end="00:14:37.740" style="s2">constituting them and making them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.400" end="00:14:41.640" style="s2">again not as individuals but as</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.740" end="00:14:44.100" style="s2">participants right in this project of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.640" end="00:14:46.260" style="s2">how the patterns of intelligibility are</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.100" end="00:14:50.520" style="s2">working themselves out through our</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.260" end="00:14:54.530" style="s2">thought through our behavior through our</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.520" end="00:15:00.890" style="s2">ways of living and being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.530" end="00:15:05.490" style="s2">so Hegel understands the process of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.890" end="00:15:10.350" style="s2">understanding as of the creation of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.490" end="00:15:11.790" style="s2">system or systematization because when</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.350" end="00:15:14.010" style="s2">I&#39;m doing this when I&#39;m differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.790" end="00:15:15.750" style="s2">things and also integrating them</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.010" end="00:15:21.480" style="s2">together I&#39;m putting them into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.750" end="00:15:25.520" style="s2">systematic relationship and so let me</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.480" end="00:15:27.630" style="s2">give you an analogy right for for</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.520" end="00:15:30.270" style="s2">understanding Hegel please remember it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.630" end="00:15:32.040" style="s2">an analogy so when you study child</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.270" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">development you can see children have</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.040" end="00:15:37.620" style="s2">ways of making sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:40.650" style="s2">that discloses the world to them in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.620" end="00:15:43.740" style="s2">certain way and that way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.650" end="00:15:45.980" style="s2">make sense works for them it gives them</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.740" end="00:15:48.780" style="s2">a certain understanding</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.980" end="00:15:51.210" style="s2">but what happens as you go through</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.780" end="00:15:55.170" style="s2">stages of development is that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.210" end="00:15:57.660" style="s2">system gets incredibly improved things</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.170" end="00:15:59.780" style="s2">that were often confused together get</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.660" end="00:16:02.250" style="s2">differentiated apart and they get</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.780" end="00:16:04.020" style="s2">reintegrated so that you get a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.250" end="00:16:07.050" style="s2">sophisticated systematic understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.020" end="00:16:08.760" style="s2">of the world and again when I say this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.050" end="00:16:10.740" style="s2">understanding you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.760" end="00:16:13.740" style="s2">that it means right</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.740" end="00:16:20.130" style="s2">not just in your head but how the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.740" end="00:16:23.160" style="s2">is structured for you so you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.130" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">living system of patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.160" end="00:16:28.760" style="s2">intelligibility and you see across</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:31.380" style="s2">history that it&#39;s always being</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.760" end="00:16:36.170" style="s2">articulated by differentiation and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.380" end="00:16:40.470" style="s2">being integrated into a systematic way</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.170" end="00:16:45.080" style="s2">of understanding being and not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.470" end="00:16:45.080" style="s2">being but how the world is being to us</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.250" end="00:16:55.170" style="s2">so higgles thought he saw this internal</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.340" end="00:16:58.130" style="s2">development in Geist that this is his</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.170" end="00:17:02.790" style="s2">name as I said for this explosion of an</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.130" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">extended mind right it was it had an</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.790" end="00:17:12.270" style="s2">internal development much like a living</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:13.620" style="s2">thing much like a child right so what</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.270" end="00:17:18.210" style="s2">what do you see happening what you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.620" end="00:17:20.580" style="s2">see in the history of ideas as we try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.210" end="00:17:23.430" style="s2">make sense of things you&#39;ll see an idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.580" end="00:17:27.350" style="s2">is proposed particular idea a way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.430" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">understanding and it gets contrasted</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.350" end="00:17:34.410" style="s2">right it gets clarified it gets</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">distinguished it gets differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.410" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">from a counter idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.250" end="00:17:49.370" style="s2">but then what typically happens right is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.370" end="00:17:54.230" style="s2">that these two ideas then are drawn</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.370" end="00:17:57.530" style="s2">together into a higher integration now</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.230" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">this is often popularly explained the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.530" end="00:18:02.929" style="s2">Hegel doesn&#39;t actually use these terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:07.210" style="s2">this way but this is often explained by</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.929" end="00:18:14.290" style="s2">this idea of thesis antithesis and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.210" end="00:18:14.290" style="s2">synthesis right</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.170" end="00:18:24.380" style="s2">so the idea is you get an idea you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.680" end="00:18:26.510" style="s2">get a counter idea it&#39;s integrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.380" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">together and then this serves as a new</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.510" end="00:18:32.180" style="s2">idea to start the whole process again</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">there&#39;s the counter idea right and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.180" end="00:18:37.670" style="s2">that gets integrated and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:41.300" style="s2">forth and what you have is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.670" end="00:18:44.420" style="s2">increasing articulation and integration</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.300" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">of the patterns of intelligibility which</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.420" end="00:18:49.310" style="s2">for Hegel given the argument are also</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:51.730" style="s2">the patterns of realness the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.310" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">reality you get this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.730" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">complexification you get emerging</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:19:02.800" style="s2">capacities for understanding and being</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:02.800" style="s2">in the world he calls this process</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.670" end="00:19:14.380" style="s2">dialectic alright so just give a quick</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.560" end="00:19:18.800" style="s2">example from the history of ideas right</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.380" end="00:19:23.390" style="s2">you have people who are trying to write</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.800" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">get out what is reality what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.390" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">thing is reality and you&#39;ll have certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:33.560" style="s2">people like Parmenides and Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:35.870" style="s2">saying well being right for things to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.560" end="00:19:40.040" style="s2">is ultimately for thing right reality is</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.870" end="00:19:41.930" style="s2">changeless because when I know something</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.040" end="00:19:44.570" style="s2">I know it to be true and for things to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.930" end="00:19:47.060" style="s2">be true right it has to be that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.570" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">the way they really are and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.060" end="00:19:51.710" style="s2">changing and I try to know them I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:54.040" style="s2">ever get a true grasp of them and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.710" end="00:19:56.630" style="s2">get this idea that reality is changeless</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.040" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">right and then you get people like</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.630" end="00:20:03.110" style="s2">Heraclitus and others saying no no if</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:05.660" style="s2">you do that then the whole capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.110" end="00:20:08.660" style="s2">understanding understanding your</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.660" end="00:20:10.850" style="s2">experience of reality that things are</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.660" end="00:20:13.070" style="s2">changing if you if you write off all</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.850" end="00:20:15.530" style="s2">that experience as an illusion then</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.070" end="00:20:17.270" style="s2">there&#39;s no content to your experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.530" end="00:20:19.820" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing actually that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.270" end="00:20:22.660" style="s2">having an experience about in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.820" end="00:20:25.660" style="s2">argue the opposite that reality is pure</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.660" end="00:20:25.660" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:32.910" style="s2">so you got Parmenides right and an</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.260" end="00:20:36.120" style="s2">aspect of Plato and then you got</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.910" end="00:20:38.370" style="s2">Heraclitus now to be real is to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.120" end="00:20:40.560" style="s2">unchanging no to be real is to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.370" end="00:20:42.420" style="s2">changing and you know you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.560" end="00:20:44.430" style="s2">where people in our culture they&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.420" end="00:20:45.780" style="s2">about reality as if it&#39;s eternity but</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.430" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll also talk about there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.780" end="00:20:50.700" style="s2">as real as change itself that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:54.450" style="s2">always in process and then Plato comes</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.700" end="00:20:56.970" style="s2">along as we&#39;ve seen and proposes a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.450" end="00:20:59.940" style="s2">of integrating them together and what he</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.970" end="00:21:07.550" style="s2">says is know that there are eternal</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.940" end="00:21:17.430" style="s2">patterns and they write structurally</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.550" end="00:21:19.380" style="s2">organize changing processes and if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.430" end="00:21:21.900" style="s2">remember that maps on to this is more</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.380" end="00:21:24.120" style="s2">having to do with the upper world the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.900" end="00:21:25.560" style="s2">more real world and this is the more</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.120" end="00:21:27.810" style="s2">looser your world and you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.560" end="00:21:29.370" style="s2">played out in our science what do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.810" end="00:21:30.900" style="s2">think you say what do you mean John well</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.370" end="00:21:32.790" style="s2">science is built around the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.900" end="00:21:34.950" style="s2">there are these eternal patterns laws</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.790" end="00:21:37.740" style="s2">and yet they constrain and interact with</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.950" end="00:21:42.090" style="s2">forces which are defined completely and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.740" end="00:21:45.330" style="s2">how they change things and so science</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.090" end="00:21:48.950" style="s2">right is a synthesis out of these two</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.330" end="00:21:52.410" style="s2">ways of trying to understand reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.950" end="00:21:54.180" style="s2">okay and it ultimately goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.410" end="00:21:56.580" style="s2">Plato and we and we use math to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.180" end="00:22:00.330" style="s2">about this and we use experiments to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.580" end="00:22:03.300" style="s2">talk about this and and so forth okay so</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.330" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">this is not a ridiculous idea that Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.300" end="00:22:07.380" style="s2">has it&#39;s a profound idea you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:10.170" style="s2">at work and if you talk about something</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.380" end="00:22:13.320" style="s2">to use I think a strong analogy about</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.170" end="00:22:15.150" style="s2">how science is progressing and something</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.320" end="00:22:17.370" style="s2">about the patterns that science</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.150" end="00:22:19.650" style="s2">discovers are also the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.370" end="00:22:22.800" style="s2">reality then you have something strongly</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.650" end="00:22:25.160" style="s2">analogous to how how Hegel is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.800" end="00:22:25.160" style="s2">of Geist</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.059" end="00:22:34.490" style="s2">so this dialectic even the term that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.120" end="00:22:36.289" style="s2">Hegel uses by the way this is inspired</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.490" end="00:22:38.750" style="s2">by Plato although I think Hegel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.289" end="00:22:42.230" style="s2">interpretation of dialectic is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.750" end="00:22:48.639" style="s2">different from plato&#39;s but this whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.230" end="00:22:51.350" style="s2">process of the way in which Geist is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.639" end="00:22:54.070" style="s2">historically developing is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.350" end="00:22:58.330" style="s2">self transcendence on Geist&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.070" end="00:23:04.490" style="s2">emergence it&#39;s the way in which Geist is</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.330" end="00:23:07.639" style="s2">developing self actualizing the way in</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.490" end="00:23:11.450" style="s2">which it is moving from a more and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.639" end="00:23:17.230" style="s2">irrational making sense to a more and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.450" end="00:23:17.230" style="s2">more rational systematic making sense so</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.529" end="00:23:31.070" style="s2">Hegel proposes that in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.200" end="00:23:33.289" style="s2">dialectic we can get to a stage where</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.070" end="00:23:37.730" style="s2">the system of understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.289" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">realization becomes aware of itself that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.730" end="00:23:43.370" style="s2">one of the things the one of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:50.809" style="s2">one of those systems of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.370" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">that emerges is this idea itself and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.809" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">see what that means and and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:56.149" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s hubris and Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:58.730" style="s2">here right because what Hegel is</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.149" end="00:24:02.029" style="s2">basically saying is his philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.730" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">the philosophy in which this process of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.029" end="00:24:08.149" style="s2">Geist and realization has become</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:14.029" style="s2">reflectively aware of it in which this</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.149" end="00:24:17.080" style="s2">practice process has created a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.029" end="00:24:20.779" style="s2">systematic understanding that grasps the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.080" end="00:24:23.690" style="s2">dialectical principles of Geist when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.779" end="00:24:27.259" style="s2">get that then you have what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.690" end="00:24:30.590" style="s2">right absolute spirit absolute Geist</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.259" end="00:24:33.230" style="s2">there&#39;s this T loss there&#39;s this goal in</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.590" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">this whole process all of history is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.230" end="00:24:39.679" style="s2">moving and of course he now sees himself</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:40.820" style="s2">as the discoverer of this but all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.679" end="00:24:49.940" style="s2">history is move</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.820" end="00:24:51.950" style="s2">to this moment of absolute idealism so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.940" end="00:24:54.050" style="s2">rationality is seen as a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.950" end="00:24:59.060" style="s2">process in the self-development of guyst</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.050" end="00:25:00.710" style="s2">of its self understanding now many of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.060" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">you probably finding that this is very</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.710" end="00:25:06.440" style="s2">impersonal way of talking about mind and</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:08.180" style="s2">meaning and we will come back to that so</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.440" end="00:25:16.490" style="s2">hold on to that we will come back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.180" end="00:25:19.670" style="s2">that so when the process of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.490" end="00:25:22.370" style="s2">of understanding passes into this stage</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.670" end="00:25:26.650" style="s2">of self understanding when the process</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.140" end="00:27:03.940" style="s2">and the real is the rational this was</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.029" end="00:32:09.380" style="s2">history I want to show you how Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.010" end="00:32:15.860" style="s2">does this in a specific example this</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.380" end="00:32:20.970" style="s2">this translation between mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.860" end="00:32:25.340" style="s2">philosophy to create the new religion</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.970" end="00:32:28.220" style="s2">that is beyond right all other religions</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.340" end="00:32:33.260" style="s2">so let&#39;s think of the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.220" end="00:32:37.260" style="s2">understanding right is moving to reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.260" end="00:32:39.210" style="s2">and you can see that right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.260" end="00:32:46.039" style="s2">directly parallel to the process by</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.210" end="00:32:46.039" style="s2">which mythology is moving to philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.230" end="00:32:56.170" style="s2">so let&#39;s get an example of a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.530" end="00:32:57.430" style="s2">important mythological structure and of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.170" end="00:33:00.130" style="s2">course I&#39;m gonna take Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.430" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">because I tried to show you Hegel is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.130" end="00:33:07.570" style="s2">secularizing Christianity in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:10.180" style="s2">so you Hegel argues that right let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.570" end="00:33:14.710" style="s2">the myth on this side and then the fill</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.180" end="00:33:16.930" style="s2">it with the philosophy on this side and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.710" end="00:33:19.570" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see how we go from making</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.930" end="00:33:22.450" style="s2">sense of things to this self-realization</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.570" end="00:33:26.500" style="s2">participating in that the the system</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.450" end="00:33:31.300" style="s2">that grasps the systematicity of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.500" end="00:33:34.870" style="s2">whole process so you have the Father and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.300" end="00:33:39.280" style="s2">the Trinity what does the father</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.870" end="00:33:41.790" style="s2">represent well the father represents</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.280" end="00:33:45.490" style="s2">Hegel would argue understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.790" end="00:33:47.670" style="s2">undifferentiated unarticulated unnatural</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.490" end="00:33:47.670" style="s2">eyes</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">unarticulated an actual eyes I am</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.169" end="00:34:18.909" style="s2">okay and then of course the idea is you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.609" end="00:34:20.230" style="s2">get the incarnation in the Sun sorry</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.909" end="00:34:22.980" style="s2">that should be capitalized I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.230" end="00:34:22.980" style="s2">any disrespect</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.579" end="00:34:29.529" style="s2">right now the incarnation is how our</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:31.809" style="s2">understanding starts to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.529" end="00:34:34.869" style="s2">differentiated into particulars here is</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.809" end="00:34:36.789" style="s2">a table here&#39;s a cop right I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.869" end="00:34:39.309" style="s2">the worlds over there we get all this</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.789" end="00:34:45.720" style="s2">articulation so you get the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.309" end="00:34:50.950" style="s2">right articulation in two particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.720" end="00:34:54.359" style="s2">things and so you can see there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.950" end="00:34:59.589" style="s2">sense in which right the Sun is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.359" end="00:35:02.619" style="s2">counter the antithesis of the Father all</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.589" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">right but then you get right the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.619" end="00:35:09.039" style="s2">reconcile the reconciliation of the son</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">to the Father you know there&#39;s the sign</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.039" end="00:35:14.670" style="s2">is sacrificed and the son reconciles</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:14.670" style="s2">with the father</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.200" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">and that of course is right that moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.020" end="00:35:28.339" style="s2">of higher integration a higher new kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:35.060" style="s2">of identity is created so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.339" end="00:35:36.650" style="s2">corresponds to the realization again</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.060" end="00:35:38.480" style="s2">trying to pick up of both meanings of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.650" end="00:35:40.970" style="s2">this term the realization of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.480" end="00:35:43.270" style="s2">identity indifference of the father in</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.060" end="00:36:06.330" style="s2">so the father and son are both different</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.460" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">in one and that&#39;s how understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.330" end="00:36:10.530" style="s2">now moving to this process where the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">integration and the differentiation are</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.530" end="00:36:15.570" style="s2">being brought together understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:18.630" style="s2">realizing that understanding is made out</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.570" end="00:36:20.730" style="s2">of differentiation and integration and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.630" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of reconciliation a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.730" end="00:36:27.420" style="s2">higher-order self-awareness that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:33.410" style="s2">taking place and then we finally moved</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.420" end="00:36:35.940" style="s2">down here right to the Holy Spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.410" end="00:36:38.520" style="s2">of course there&#39;s a bit of a pun</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.940" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">intended because that&#39;s you know Geist</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.520" end="00:36:47.510" style="s2">is one way of translating spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:55.050" style="s2">this is what what did we see in the New</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.510" end="00:36:57.360" style="s2">Testament the idea that God is agape God</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.050" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">is identical to the very process by</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.360" end="00:37:03.030" style="s2">which we are making each other into</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.610" style="s2">persons and we don&#39;t individually</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.030" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">possess agape in our minds cappe is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.610" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">agape is something we dwell within a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:13.170" style="s2">process of making sense and making</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:17.490" style="s2">persons and making community of persons</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.170" end="00:37:21.240" style="s2">and of course what does the holy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.490" end="00:37:23.850" style="s2">corresponds to well this is that right</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.240" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">this is Geist dwelling within its self</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.850" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.760" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">God has always been agape we just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.610" end="00:37:50.630" style="s2">realize it God is dwelling within the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">development of the community this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.630" end="00:37:58.750" style="s2">what Hegel&#39;s doing this is why Hegel has</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:04.660" style="s2">been called the Thomas Aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.750" end="00:38:07.970" style="s2">Protestantism he&#39;s doing right in</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.660" end="00:38:11.600" style="s2">Germany post the Protestant Reformation</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.970" end="00:38:14.390" style="s2">what Aquinas was doing when if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.600" end="00:38:16.280" style="s2">remember when European fought the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.390" end="00:38:19.790" style="s2">systems of European thought encountered</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.280" end="00:38:24.770" style="s2">Aristotelian science Hegel is now taking</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.790" end="00:38:26.630" style="s2">right all of the machinery right the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.770" end="00:38:29.210" style="s2">theological machinery that he sees at</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.630" end="00:38:31.690" style="s2">work in myth and he is integrating it</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.210" end="00:38:34.300" style="s2">with the philosophical and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.690" end="00:38:38.690" style="s2">understanding that is impacting so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.300" end="00:38:40.700" style="s2">powerfully on Europe in his time he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.690" end="00:38:42.860" style="s2">trying to deal with how to restructure</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.700" end="00:38:45.940" style="s2">Christianity in light of the Scientific</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.940" end="00:38:52.850" style="s2">and this is what he&#39;s doing and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.880" end="00:38:57.800" style="s2">creates this powerful system it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.850" end="00:39:02.390" style="s2">just tremendously powerful system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.800" end="00:39:05.540" style="s2">grand synthesis and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.390" end="00:39:07.400" style="s2">because Hegel felt and I said there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.540" end="00:39:09.650" style="s2">element of hubris in here but that his</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.400" end="00:39:12.500" style="s2">system exemplified what it was talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.650" end="00:39:16.520" style="s2">about his philosophical system in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.500" end="00:39:19.430" style="s2">way it provided at a total present in</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.520" end="00:39:23.320" style="s2">that word a total explanation of reality</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.310" end="00:39:35.870" style="s2">he thought it exemplified it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.190" end="00:39:41.780" style="s2">demonstrated it and so German idealism</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.870" end="00:39:47.230" style="s2">was just massively influential because</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.780" end="00:39:47.230" style="s2">of this grand synthesis that it offered</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.380" end="00:39:53.509" style="s2">but you can see what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.319" end="00:39:57.710" style="s2">right you can see that this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.509" end="00:40:02.170" style="s2">powerful attempt to try and save the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.710" end="00:40:05.660" style="s2">meaning making machinery and salvage the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.170" end="00:40:09.549" style="s2">axial legacy and somehow give us an</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.660" end="00:40:13.249" style="s2">account of right how we can still</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.549" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">develop an increasing contact with</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.249" end="00:40:23.319" style="s2">reality in a way that is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:26.210" style="s2">spiritual and rational at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.319" end="00:40:32.890" style="s2">Hegel is in many ways a Titanic figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.210" end="00:40:36.859" style="s2">trying to provide a powerful grammar</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.890" end="00:40:40.039" style="s2">philosophical set of you know concepts</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.859" end="00:40:45.160" style="s2">the conceptual vocabulary and and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.039" end="00:40:49.069" style="s2">theoretical the theoretical principles</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.160" end="00:40:50.690" style="s2">for structuring that vocabulary he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.069" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">trying to create a grammar by which we</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.690" end="00:40:57.170" style="s2">can deeply respond to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:59.989" style="s2">he&#39;s enormous ly popular and as I said</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.170" end="00:41:04.460" style="s2">this this form of German idealism</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.989" end="00:41:05.930" style="s2">spreads across Europe very powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.460" end="00:41:08.719" style="s2">deeply influential you&#39;ll even see</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.930" end="00:41:11.779" style="s2">figures within America like Josiah Royce</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.719" end="00:41:13.519" style="s2">early on in the Kalista intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.779" end="00:41:20.299" style="s2">history of America deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.519" end="00:41:22.489" style="s2">Hegel so why why is this important well</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.299" end="00:41:25.969" style="s2">Hegel is just gonna have a profound</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.489" end="00:41:27.499" style="s2">impact on any future attempts to try and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.969" end="00:41:29.479" style="s2">respond to their meaning crisis just</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.499" end="00:41:36.109" style="s2">because of the way he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.479" end="00:41:40.719" style="s2">synthesize everything together but</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.109" end="00:41:40.719" style="s2">what&#39;s more important is for many people</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.499" end="00:41:47.269" style="s2">this form of idealism German idealism</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.999" end="00:41:53.890" style="s2">has completely collapsed it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.269" end="00:41:53.890" style="s2">no longer considered a viable position</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.280" end="00:41:59.530" style="s2">now I&#39;m not here to argue about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.930" end="00:42:02.360" style="s2">sort of an abstract philosophical level</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.530" end="00:42:05.180" style="s2">I&#39;m right because there of course there</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.360" end="00:42:07.270" style="s2">are many defenders of Hegel today I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.180" end="00:42:11.090" style="s2">to take a look at what has happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.270" end="00:42:16.580" style="s2">right in the critical response to Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.090" end="00:42:19.250" style="s2">and how that has infused the development</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.580" end="00:42:32.090" style="s2">and the intensification of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.250" end="00:42:43.180" style="s2">crisis remember Hegel sets up this</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.090" end="00:42:48.230" style="s2">pattern of secularizing religion into</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.180" end="00:42:53.960" style="s2">systems of ideas that attempt to give us</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.230" end="00:42:59.420" style="s2">a total explanation and guide he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.960" end="00:43:02.320" style="s2">Godfather in this sense of totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.420" end="00:43:02.320" style="s2">ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.980" end="00:43:15.589" style="s2">so you have three main avenues of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.140" end="00:43:19.220" style="s2">response we already did one the person</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.589" end="00:43:22.130" style="s2">who has a right deep critique of Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.220" end="00:43:24.829" style="s2">is Schopenhauer because and as you</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.130" end="00:43:27.140" style="s2">remember Schopenhauer understands the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.829" end="00:43:28.130" style="s2">relationship not the way Hegel does in</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.140" end="00:43:30.470" style="s2">terms of reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.130" end="00:43:33.650" style="s2">Schopenhauer understands it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.470" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">will the will to live and then Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.650" end="00:43:37.540" style="s2">takes that up as the will to power and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:41.810" style="s2">he tries to use that as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.540" end="00:43:42.890" style="s2">recapturing right self-transcendent so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.810" end="00:43:44.089" style="s2">we&#39;ve already talked about that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.890" end="00:43:49.070" style="s2">not going to go over that again but</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.089" end="00:43:52.430" style="s2">please remember it right so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.070" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">that the aspect of will and the will to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.430" end="00:43:56.630" style="s2">live and the will to power wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:44:04.040" style="s2">adequately being addressed was what</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.630" end="00:44:05.720" style="s2">Schopenhauer points to okay and then we</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.040" end="00:44:10.700" style="s2">have of course the tremendous critique</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.720" end="00:44:12.650" style="s2">of kirkegaard right where the guard</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.700" end="00:44:16.849" style="s2">famously said Hegel made a system and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.650" end="00:44:19.220" style="s2">then sat down beside it what&#39;s he what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.930" end="00:44:34.790" style="s2">in Hegel&#39;s whole proposal it has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:36.230" style="s2">rendered into a system of ideas all of</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.400" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not what I&#39;m trying to do here</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.740" end="00:49:01.130" style="s2">March is basically saying right</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.380" end="00:49:03.350" style="s2">that history is not driven by think of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.130" end="00:49:05.330" style="s2">Plato think of the man and the lion and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.350" end="00:49:08.150" style="s2">the monster history is not driven by</p>

<p begin="00:49:27.080" end="00:49:33.050" style="s2">so marks was of course deeply influenced</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.540" end="00:49:38.900" style="s2">also by flora Bach which means fire</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.050" end="00:49:40.670" style="s2">stream it&#39;s a great name and mark says</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.670" end="00:49:45.260" style="s2">passed through the fire stream of fire</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.560" end="00:49:49.010" style="s2">box work Feuerbach made this proposal</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.260" end="00:49:52.130" style="s2">that religion contra de Hegel that</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.010" end="00:49:55.010" style="s2">religion is not the arena in which Geist</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.130" end="00:49:56.330" style="s2">has been unfolding itself and reality</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.010" end="00:49:59.540" style="s2">and intelligibility had been</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.330" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">co-developing instead he argues that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.540" end="00:50:03.860" style="s2">religion is a projection a term of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:07.310" style="s2">course that Freud and Jung are going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.860" end="00:50:08.810" style="s2">pick up on that when I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.310" end="00:50:13.190" style="s2">God what I&#39;m actually doing is</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.810" end="00:50:16.250" style="s2">projecting an ideal model of my own</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.190" end="00:50:19.990" style="s2">humanity and firebox idea is that this</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.250" end="00:50:23.330" style="s2">projection distorts and distracts us</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.990" end="00:50:26.660" style="s2">deludes us and it ultimately alienates</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.330" end="00:50:30.710" style="s2">human beings from their own role within</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.660" end="00:50:32.690" style="s2">historical processes so March is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.710" end="00:50:34.430" style="s2">to take up this idea this critique of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.690" end="00:50:37.910" style="s2">religion and he&#39;s going to see religion</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.430" end="00:50:40.700" style="s2">not as Hegel does as you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.910" end="00:50:42.770" style="s2">the vessel and vehicle in which Geist is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.700" end="00:50:46.910" style="s2">unfolding itself he&#39;s going to see</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.770" end="00:50:49.190" style="s2">religion as a noxious projection that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.910" end="00:50:51.860" style="s2">actually deluding people and distracting</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.190" end="00:50:59.660" style="s2">them from how they are the authors of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.860" end="00:51:03.110" style="s2">history so what Marx does is he says</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.660" end="00:51:06.140" style="s2">okay once we get rid of the religious</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.110" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">distortion and we shift to the material</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.140" end="00:51:12.140" style="s2">monster we see the dialectic at work</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:15.940" style="s2">there the dialectic is a dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.140" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">materialism not a dialectical idealism</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.940" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">right so the clash is not between ideas</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:29.600" style="s2">that are contrasting and integrating the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:32.540" style="s2">clash is a process of political struggle</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.600" end="00:51:35.630" style="s2">between opposing ways of socio economic</p>

<p begin="00:51:45.670" end="00:51:54.890" style="s2">articulation has been turned into one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:57.320" style="s2">conflict between these classes but these</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.890" end="00:52:00.560" style="s2">classes are nevertheless systematically</p>

<p begin="00:52:06.290" end="00:52:11.060" style="s2">history is a dialectic good is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">constantly through these clash these</p>

<p begin="00:52:18.610" end="00:52:24.380" style="s2">this is what this is the core of Marx&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.130" end="00:52:26.090" style="s2">critique of capitalism that contains all</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.380" end="00:52:29.540" style="s2">these inherent self contradictions and</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.610" end="00:52:55.370" style="s2">land so what is Marx done do you see</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.980" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">he&#39;s actually in a sense completing I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.820" end="00:53:13.940" style="s2">adequate solution but this is what he</p>
