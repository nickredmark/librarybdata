<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:27.390" style="s2">can ask a question have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.709" end="00:02:30.209" style="s2">people come together and brainstorm it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.390" end="00:02:32.880" style="s2">where we&#39;d have the questions that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.209" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">asked about our cooperative to move it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.880" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">forward and be able to get people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:39.810" style="s2">feedback on what is and isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:41.880" style="s2">for them and so people are invited to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.810" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">all you have to do as an individual is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.880" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">bring yourself to the table exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:48.390" style="s2">you are with your level of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:49.769" style="s2">your level of experience bring you that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.390" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">is the greatest gift you can bring to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.769" end="00:02:55.769" style="s2">the conversation also you do not have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:03:00.660" style="s2">have a conversation with any single</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.769" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">individual like you don&#39;t you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.660" end="00:03:02.819" style="s2">to say that someone&#39;s unable to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">participate in the greater conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.819" end="00:03:07.340" style="s2">you can say I&#39;m not going to participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">in a conversation with that person and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.340" end="00:03:11.549" style="s2">creating the tools to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">facilitate that so that more of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.549" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">energy is going towards the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">and not the interpersonal drama that can</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">occur that doesn&#39;t need to occur</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.019" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">there&#39;ll be some that occurs because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">helps us move forward but we are just</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">going to continually perfect the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.810" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">experience of having the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">creating the tools to make to create</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">action out of that while never reaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">perfection it&#39;s just constantly asking</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">what&#39;s not working and how do we get it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:44.819" style="s2">to work on a massive scale and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:47.970" style="s2">speaking of that I hosted the first hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.819" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">cafe that was going to be around what</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.970" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">like a virtual table of us having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:52.139" style="s2">video conversation it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">just one table because that was only</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.139" end="00:03:58.829" style="s2">gonna be four of us and nobody showed up</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">to it and so in that space I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.829" end="00:04:01.440" style="s2">enough interpersonal work where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.239" style="s2">make that mean anything I&#39;m like right</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.440" end="00:04:06.269" style="s2">so the question is why why didn&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.239" end="00:04:07.799" style="s2">show up why and having the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.269" end="00:04:10.620" style="s2">but one didn&#39;t work about the timeslot</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.799" end="00:04:12.810" style="s2">about your life at general about I had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.620" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">bad day well you&#39;re allowed to not come</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.810" end="00:04:15.569" style="s2">if you have a bad day you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">allowed to come and have a bad day</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.569" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">you&#39;re allowed to bring your bad days to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:21.090" style="s2">the table that is who you are in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:22.710" style="s2">moment and so both of those things are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.090" end="00:04:23.909" style="s2">fine but then we needed like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.710" end="00:04:25.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for me is sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.909" end="00:04:30.330" style="s2">talking whom have you to conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.980" end="00:04:31.740" style="s2">with one person so I need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.330" end="00:04:33.450" style="s2">know that people are gonna be at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.740" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">table when we host the host because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.450" end="00:04:37.530" style="s2">want to have the conversation and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:39.210" style="s2">both I found a way to have that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.530" end="00:04:41.700" style="s2">conversation without people being at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.210" end="00:04:45.300" style="s2">table which I posted the question which</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.700" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">is this week&#39;s question is what makes a</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:47.580" style="s2">participate and allowing us to fail in</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.169" end="00:07:50.220" style="s2">the right direction where failure is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.580" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">just a step towards success everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.220" end="00:07:53.930" style="s2">that goes wrong is a learning experience</p>
