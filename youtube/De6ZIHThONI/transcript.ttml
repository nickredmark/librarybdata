<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">that I written that one together with my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:02:01.490" style="s2">friend and colleague Lynn Anderson</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.520" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">Danish philosopher Anna and otter</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.490" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">and then I should also mention that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:10.770" style="s2">actually the first book I wrote which I</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2">think is becoming more and more relevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.770" end="00:02:15.230" style="s2">actually was coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.580" end="00:02:18.830" style="s2">banking world I&#39;ve been an investment</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.230" end="00:02:21.860" style="s2">for for for many years and before that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.830" end="00:02:24.890" style="s2">was in mathematics and physics and using</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.860" end="00:02:27.170" style="s2">then my mathematical and the skills are</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.890" end="00:02:31.190" style="s2">modeling in Investment Banking</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.170" end="00:02:33.140" style="s2">so when I left Investment Banking a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.190" end="00:02:36.920" style="s2">more than ten years ago and set up my</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.140" end="00:02:39.650" style="s2">own foundation in Stockholm B Oak Island</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.920" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">Foundation a credit the first book I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.650" end="00:02:50.360" style="s2">wrote is called the market myth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:52.670" style="s2">really my experience from the inside in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.360" end="00:02:55.780" style="s2">the market as an investment banker for</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.670" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">more than twenty years thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.780" end="00:03:00.880" style="s2">the strengths the strength of the market</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:04.040" style="s2">yes because of course the market is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.880" end="00:03:07.610" style="s2">incredibly strength strength strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:09.740" style="s2">human invention but we should remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.610" end="00:03:13.850" style="s2">that it is a human invention it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.740" end="00:03:16.070" style="s2">natural phenomena but also we have I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.850" end="00:03:19.160" style="s2">think that I argue in that book put a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.070" end="00:03:22.150" style="s2">little bit too much faith in the market</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.160" end="00:03:26.630" style="s2">and the market has sort of become a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:29.750" style="s2">guiding star for all human activities in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.630" end="00:03:35.810" style="s2">in a way that the market is not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.750" end="00:03:38.330" style="s2">suitable to accomplish so as good at</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.810" end="00:03:40.550" style="s2">market is in many ways the market is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.330" end="00:03:43.220" style="s2">cannot help us with a number of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.550" end="00:03:45.769" style="s2">and I think that is at least here in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.220" end="00:03:49.180" style="s2">Scandinavia becoming very evident now in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.769" end="00:03:52.989" style="s2">their kovat crisis where we in</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.180" end="00:03:57.380" style="s2">Scandinavia has sort of privatized the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.989" end="00:03:59.000" style="s2">most aspects of health care and medicine</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.380" end="00:04:01.790" style="s2">and all of that and it comes a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.000" end="00:04:05.480" style="s2">bit as a surprise now to the society</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.790" end="00:04:10.310" style="s2">that the market has not really been able</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.480" end="00:04:13.970" style="s2">to provide those buffers and been able</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.310" end="00:04:19.630" style="s2">to be long-term enough to help us in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.970" end="00:04:26.660" style="s2">this crisis so that was the first book I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.630" end="00:04:27.380" style="s2">wrote and then you mentioned the market</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.660" end="00:04:29.300" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.380" end="00:04:32.450" style="s2">which sorry you mentioned the Nordic</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.300" end="00:04:37.670" style="s2">secret which is about yeah which is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.450" end="00:04:40.550" style="s2">which is about the fact that we in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.670" end="00:04:44.540" style="s2">Nordic countries actually had very</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.550" end="00:04:49.760" style="s2">visionary politicians and intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.540" end="00:04:53.660" style="s2">a hundred to 150 years ago who really</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.760" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">saw the connection between personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.660" end="00:05:02.360" style="s2">inner development and our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:06.230" style="s2">make meaning I would say and societal</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.360" end="00:05:09.110" style="s2">change and how this insight really</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.230" end="00:05:13.130" style="s2">helped to lift all the Nordic countries</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.110" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">from being the the poorest non</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.130" end="00:05:20.690" style="s2">democratic agrarian countries 150 years</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:24.500" style="s2">ago to become just a few generations</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.690" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">later they&#39;re happiest richest most</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.500" end="00:05:29.960" style="s2">stable democracies in in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">that was really this focus on on in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.960" end="00:05:35.930" style="s2">development so making a long story short</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">there what we did back then was that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.930" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">started actually a huge number of what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:45.560" style="s2">sometimes jokingly called retreat</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:49.010" style="s2">centers all over Scandinavia and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.560" end="00:05:51.260" style="s2">later on made it possible for young</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.010" end="00:05:54.200" style="s2">adults in their twenties to spend six</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.260" end="00:05:57.550" style="s2">months at one of these centers with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.200" end="00:06:01.580" style="s2">expressed aim of developing your inner</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.550" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">capacities to be able to act as what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.580" end="00:06:08.000" style="s2">today might call conscious co-creators</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">in the creation of of modernity and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.000" end="00:06:16.040" style="s2">democracy so that&#39;s that&#39;s quite quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:21.920" style="s2">quite an amazing story and and and not</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.040" end="00:06:23.750" style="s2">that well-known and then in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.920" end="00:06:26.600" style="s2">that we created you sort of went through</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.750" end="00:06:28.670" style="s2">also this historical analysis sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.600" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">sequence of normativity x&#39; you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.670" end="00:06:32.030" style="s2">there was the norma to be alone religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">and god and then there was a normativity</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.030" end="00:06:37.310" style="s2">coming out of order natee around you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:38.570" style="s2">know science and then you say that has</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.310" end="00:06:40.310" style="s2">fallen under critique with</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.570" end="00:06:42.200" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.310" end="00:06:44.510" style="s2">and this dovetailed with your firstborn</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.200" end="00:06:47.090" style="s2">that has left the market as sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.510" end="00:06:49.730" style="s2">fact of default normativity governing</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.090" end="00:06:51.830" style="s2">everybody but as for recent you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.730" end="00:06:53.660" style="s2">already articulated well it does a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.830" end="00:06:55.550" style="s2">of things it can&#39;t do everything and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.660" end="00:06:57.350" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we shouldn&#39;t be a lie it we</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.550" end="00:07:00.020" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t let it be that kind of mob</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.350" end="00:07:13.700" style="s2">salute normativity for us so this takes</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.020" end="00:07:15.950" style="s2">me back to so what what do you see or</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.700" end="00:07:18.020" style="s2">trying to get beyond the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.950" end="00:07:22.790" style="s2">critique and we&#39;re trying to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.020" end="00:07:24.620" style="s2">place where we realize sources of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.790" end="00:07:25.760" style="s2">normativity other than the market one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.620" end="00:07:28.130" style="s2">the things you point out in the nordic</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.760" end="00:07:31.010" style="s2">secret was exactly that network right</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.130" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">that you know there was was a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.010" end="00:07:36.740" style="s2">project that network of retreat centers</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:39.229" style="s2">almost like secular monasteries where</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.740" end="00:07:40.660" style="s2">people were going in order to you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.229" end="00:07:43.040" style="s2">was individually and collectively</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.660" end="00:07:44.900" style="s2">engaged and kind of you know profound</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.040" end="00:07:47.600" style="s2">transformation and cultivate what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.900" end="00:07:49.820" style="s2">would call wisdom you know ability to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.600" end="00:07:52.880" style="s2">get a reflective awareness of their own</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.820" end="00:07:54.979" style="s2">self-deception and inculcate rationality</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.880" end="00:07:58.100" style="s2">enhance the capacity for meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.979" end="00:08:00.430" style="s2">so what I&#39;m what I&#39;m trying to now us to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.100" end="00:08:04.100" style="s2">put it sort of it bring it to a point</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.430" end="00:08:06.530" style="s2">thomas is how does all of this excellent</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.100" end="00:08:08.780" style="s2">work that you&#39;ve done and you I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.530" end="00:08:10.780" style="s2">you know I got the term from you nor the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.780" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">meta-crisis we know people are now using</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.780" end="00:08:17.060" style="s2">about coated which I think use a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:19.669" style="s2">bit more credit for the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.060" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">meta-crisis about systemic interweaving</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.669" end="00:08:25.990" style="s2">of crises and like one of the think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:29.419" style="s2">it is doing is disclosing that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.990" end="00:08:30.919" style="s2">systemic meta-crisis so what does all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.419" end="00:08:34.700" style="s2">this now what&#39;s the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.919" end="00:08:36.740" style="s2">all of this beautiful analysis and well</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.700" end="00:08:39.349" style="s2">I&#39;ll use your term you know the matter</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.740" end="00:08:42.520" style="s2">crisis how do we how do we take what</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.349" end="00:08:46.100" style="s2">you&#39;ve given us and how do we apply it</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.520" end="00:08:49.970" style="s2">to the meta crisis is that a question</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.100" end="00:08:52.790" style="s2">yeah absolutely and I mean that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.970" end="00:08:53.450" style="s2">really how my thinking and writing has</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.790" end="00:08:55.460" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:08:59.840" style="s2">has been going it has really been a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.460" end="00:09:03.020" style="s2">starting point of from analyzing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.840" end="00:09:05.780" style="s2">market and looking at the market as as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.020" end="00:09:10.220" style="s2">phenomenon as a human-made phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.780" end="00:09:13.130" style="s2">that has almost been deified at least we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.220" end="00:09:16.280" style="s2">had we have deferred a lot of normative</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.130" end="00:09:20.420" style="s2">power to the market that the market does</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.280" end="00:09:22.600" style="s2">not have at all really so that brought</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.420" end="00:09:27.380" style="s2">me into thinking it about how we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.600" end="00:09:29.330" style="s2">socially construct this world and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.380" end="00:09:31.610" style="s2">starting point of it the world we create</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.330" end="00:09:34.330" style="s2">is really as you say it&#39;s a historical</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.610" end="00:09:38.150" style="s2">description of how we as humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.330" end="00:09:42.290" style="s2">developed this unique capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.150" end="00:09:45.530" style="s2">humans to construct a symbolic universe</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.290" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">yes through our through our language we</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.530" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">cannot some animals can can use what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:55.580" style="s2">could call an index language which means</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:57.650" style="s2">that they could have one sound for one</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.580" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">type of enemy approaching and another</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.650" end="00:10:02.150" style="s2">sound indicating another natural</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:05.030" style="s2">phenomena but what is unique with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.150" end="00:10:07.610" style="s2">human symbolic language is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.030" end="00:10:13.180" style="s2">abstract from that concrete level and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.610" end="00:10:16.150" style="s2">and have concepts that has really no</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.180" end="00:10:19.370" style="s2">correspondence to the physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.150" end="00:10:22.010" style="s2">so for example a stone or a tree of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.370" end="00:10:24.670" style="s2">course has correspondence in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.010" end="00:10:29.620" style="s2">physical reality but there is no</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.670" end="00:10:35.350" style="s2">correspondence for justice beauty</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.620" end="00:10:39.350" style="s2">democracy money money corporations</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.350" end="00:10:43.280" style="s2">nation-states or all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.350" end="00:10:46.400" style="s2">in fact a result from our human ability</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.280" end="00:10:48.470" style="s2">to construct a symbolic language and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.400" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">with the help of this symbolic language</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.470" end="00:10:56.210" style="s2">we can start creating a symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:11:01.700" style="s2">universe or a what some sociologist</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.210" end="00:11:03.710" style="s2">would call a social imaginary or even</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.700" end="00:11:05.510" style="s2">better a collective imaginary yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.710" end="00:11:07.329" style="s2">something that comes from our</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.510" end="00:11:10.809" style="s2">imagination but</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.329" end="00:11:15.699" style="s2">Ritt collectively and this is a unique</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.809" end="00:11:19.689" style="s2">human ability and it&#39;s easier to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.699" end="00:11:22.360" style="s2">this collective imaginary if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.689" end="00:11:27.779" style="s2">other societies than ourselves if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.360" end="00:11:31.059" style="s2">look at a pre-modern society or even an</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.779" end="00:11:33.549" style="s2">indigenous society then we could see</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.059" end="00:11:36.850" style="s2">this collective imaginary how you can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.549" end="00:11:41.139" style="s2">start believing in concepts like spirits</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.850" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">and totem and deities and and we can a</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.139" end="00:11:46.029" style="s2">bit a bit look down on that and think</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:50.049" style="s2">that that is naive and so on but my</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.029" end="00:11:52.779" style="s2">point is really that this collective</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.049" end="00:11:56.199" style="s2">imaginary is something that is evolving</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.779" end="00:11:58.839" style="s2">throughout human history and very often</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.199" end="00:12:01.299" style="s2">it&#39;s evolving more or less linearly but</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.839" end="00:12:03.819" style="s2">at some points in human history we</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.299" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">outgrow our collective imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.819" end="00:12:11.350" style="s2">then we have a huge transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:13.089" style="s2">our whole social world and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.350" end="00:12:16.449" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think that them the meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.089" end="00:12:19.569" style="s2">crisis is is a useful concept because</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.449" end="00:12:21.699" style="s2">now we realize that all these different</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.569" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">crises is that we see today that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.699" end="00:12:27.850" style="s2">environment a crisis political crisis or</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.220" end="00:12:31.629" style="s2">or psychological crisis that they cannot</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.850" end="00:12:34.689" style="s2">be addressed individually because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.629" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">crisis is on such a fundamental level</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.689" end="00:12:39.939" style="s2">that it is really in our collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:42.600" style="s2">imaginary and that the collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.939" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">imaginary that we are living under today</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.600" end="00:12:50.860" style="s2">which we got essentially from from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:54.999" style="s2">Enlightenment transition when we went</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.860" end="00:12:57.959" style="s2">from a dogmatic religious way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.999" end="00:13:00.610" style="s2">at the world to a rationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.959" end="00:13:05.169" style="s2">scientific way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.610" end="00:13:08.339" style="s2">and and this worldview this collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.169" end="00:13:11.529" style="s2">imaginary has of course been extremely</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.339" end="00:13:14.259" style="s2">powerful and useful for humanity because</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.529" end="00:13:17.049" style="s2">it has given us modern medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.259" end="00:13:19.299" style="s2">human rights and democracy and all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.049" end="00:13:21.139" style="s2">that that we would never want to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.299" end="00:13:24.189" style="s2">without but then at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.139" end="00:13:27.769" style="s2">time I believe that we have now used</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.189" end="00:13:30.139" style="s2">them the capacity they are mean we reach</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.769" end="00:13:32.269" style="s2">the end of the capacity of this both</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.139" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">worldview and collective imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.269" end="00:13:42.019" style="s2">that we are at this transition point in</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:50.799" style="s2">our social global system and from</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.019" end="00:13:53.269" style="s2">physics I I have got this model of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.799" end="00:13:55.579" style="s2">self-organizing complex systems and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.269" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">thinking in systems theory and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.579" end="00:14:01.939" style="s2">in self-organizing systems I think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:04.249" style="s2">is so useful to do that and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.939" end="00:14:07.129" style="s2">something that is applicable of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.249" end="00:14:12.319" style="s2">not just a natural science phenomena but</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.129" end="00:14:16.689" style="s2">also to your field of cognition yes to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.319" end="00:14:19.459" style="s2">see the mind not as some sort of the in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.689" end="00:14:22.999" style="s2">machine made out of neurons but much</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.459" end="00:14:27.850" style="s2">more like a self-organizing dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.999" end="00:14:30.319" style="s2">system that has the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.850" end="00:14:33.980" style="s2">evolution and evolving throughout our</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.319" end="00:14:36.069" style="s2">lives and if you look at culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.980" end="00:14:38.569" style="s2">same way you look at culture as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.069" end="00:14:42.529" style="s2">self-organizing complex system then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.569" end="00:14:43.999" style="s2">realize that this can evolve but then</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.529" end="00:14:46.269" style="s2">also that you come to one of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.999" end="00:14:50.230" style="s2">eventually come to one of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.269" end="00:14:53.779" style="s2">transition points phase shifts points or</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.230" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">bifurcation points where system needs a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.779" end="00:15:00.799" style="s2">radical transformation that usually</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:04.699" style="s2">entails either a breakdown in complexity</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.799" end="00:15:07.999" style="s2">or a break through to a more complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.699" end="00:15:09.529" style="s2">more elegant way of of organizing and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.999" end="00:15:11.660" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s where we are right</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.529" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">now humanity we are at one of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.660" end="00:15:27.889" style="s2">bifurcation points and now it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:31.129" style="s2">breakthrough or break down cultural</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.889" end="00:15:33.230" style="s2">culture as a dynamical system and I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.129" end="00:15:34.910" style="s2">thinking about you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.230" end="00:15:37.160" style="s2">phenomena studies you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.910" end="00:15:38.900" style="s2">site and you know you&#39;ve been framing</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.160" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">things in a particular way and your</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.900" end="00:15:42.020" style="s2">frame tells you what&#39;s salient</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.640" end="00:15:43.160" style="s2">irrelevant and then you get to a point</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.020" end="00:15:47.240" style="s2">where that framing is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:53.500" style="s2">supporting you yeah or dies in</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.240" end="00:15:53.500" style="s2">criticality doesn&#39;t become pretty funny</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.310" end="00:16:02.120" style="s2">you know critical it brings down entropy</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.530" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">increases for a while you get you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.120" end="00:16:06.230" style="s2">that phase of criticality and as you say</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.450" style="s2">criticality criticality can either mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.230" end="00:16:10.550" style="s2">that the system collapses as you said</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.450" end="00:16:13.190" style="s2">ghosts or low estate or what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.550" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">insight is right the criticality breaks</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.190" end="00:16:17.510" style="s2">the structure up enough so that a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:20.420" style="s2">structure becomes possible because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.510" end="00:16:23.810" style="s2">get a high experience and of course if</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.420" end="00:16:25.820" style="s2">you do this on a real large scale with</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.810" end="00:16:27.740" style="s2">your mind that that&#39;s when you have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.820" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">sort of inner transformation or you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.740" end="00:16:36.470" style="s2">a method and metanoia yes and as and as</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:41.030" style="s2">with all self-organizing complex system</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.470" end="00:16:43.430" style="s2">in in these transitions you have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.030" end="00:16:46.270" style="s2">possibility of emergence yes yes</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.570" end="00:17:03.200" style="s2">that really for me as a physicist that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.730" end="00:17:05.960" style="s2">really made me understand that personal</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.200" end="00:17:07.490" style="s2">in the transformation a metanoia is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.960" end="00:17:09.770" style="s2">actually possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.490" end="00:17:12.710" style="s2">I mean before before that I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.770" end="00:17:16.130" style="s2">this was some sort of religious answer</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.710" end="00:17:21.070" style="s2">you know a New Age spirituality but now</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.130" end="00:17:24.050" style="s2">I can see how this is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.070" end="00:17:26.150" style="s2">probably the the the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.050" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">straightforward way for nature to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.150" end="00:17:35.060" style="s2">organize consciousness it is it is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:38.750" style="s2">provide a general function that would</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.060" end="00:17:41.000" style="s2">then take in and process information and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.750" end="00:17:44.420" style="s2">energy and then use that to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.000" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">self-organize and then to transform that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.420" end="00:17:48.140" style="s2">that would be the natural way for nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:50.900" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.140" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">very efficient way she achieved</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.900" end="00:18:01.090" style="s2">consciousness and that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">exactly trying to propose with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.090" end="00:18:05.330" style="s2">insight because what happens in insight</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:07.970" style="s2">is you get a new function that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.330" end="00:18:09.920" style="s2">the higher you get the emergence new</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.970" end="00:18:13.220" style="s2">understanding emergence of new options</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.920" end="00:18:17.330" style="s2">and so the idea that the culture might</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.220" end="00:18:19.310" style="s2">be at that point and also you you put</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.330" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">your finger I&#39;m working on a book called</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.310" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">the cognitive continuum</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:25.850" style="s2">you know from insight all the way up to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.390" end="00:18:27.080" style="s2">you know enlightenment how the state</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.850" end="00:18:29.060" style="s2">machine or you can see the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.080" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">machinery at different scales of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.060" end="00:18:32.930" style="s2">analysis and complexity when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.620" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">cognition so there&#39;s a there&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.930" end="00:18:36.860" style="s2">issue that&#39;s happening in the HAR moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:38.270" style="s2">as you said it&#39;s systemic and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.860" end="00:18:39.560" style="s2">comprehensive but that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.270" end="00:18:41.150" style="s2">ultimately happening with people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.560" end="00:18:45.070" style="s2">going through Maranoa the deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.150" end="00:18:46.460" style="s2">transformative experiences so yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.070" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.460" end="00:18:53.270" style="s2">and now if we then talk about society</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:56.660" style="s2">and our collective imaginary I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.270" end="00:18:59.890" style="s2">that we now are at the point again of</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.660" end="00:19:03.220" style="s2">criticality where we need to have such a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.890" end="00:19:07.040" style="s2">transformation such a collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.220" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">Metanoia yeah yeah and we should</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.040" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">remember and I spend the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:13.940" style="s2">my book the world we create in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:16.370" style="s2">showing that humanity has or different</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.940" end="00:19:20.120" style="s2">cultures has gone through the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.370" end="00:19:21.770" style="s2">processes many many times when we sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.120" end="00:19:24.380" style="s2">of went from going back to your original</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.770" end="00:19:28.460" style="s2">question when we went from sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.380" end="00:19:30.380" style="s2">indigenous tribal society a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.460" end="00:19:33.800" style="s2">hunter-gatherer society into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.380" end="00:19:35.690" style="s2">pre-modern civilization and then from</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.800" end="00:19:39.110" style="s2">the pre-modern civilization into</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.690" end="00:19:42.830" style="s2">modernity and now we are through post</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.110" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">modernity transitioning into something</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.830" end="00:19:47.570" style="s2">beyond the post modernity that we might</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:52.220" style="s2">call meta modernity or whatever we would</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.570" end="00:19:54.680" style="s2">like to to call that and and then of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.220" end="00:19:56.450" style="s2">course it becomes important to ask</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.680" end="00:20:00.380" style="s2">ourselves this question what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.450" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">then the system that is about to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.380" end="00:20:04.980" style="s2">transform</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:07.230" style="s2">what is this collective imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.980" end="00:20:09.960" style="s2">how does the transformation of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.230" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">collective imaginary relate to our</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.960" end="00:20:16.139" style="s2">individual transformations and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:19.350" style="s2">consciousness and and ability to hold</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.139" end="00:20:22.139" style="s2">and replicate this collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.350" end="00:20:25.590" style="s2">and the first thing of course that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.139" end="00:20:30.690" style="s2">is makes this so very difficult is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.590" end="00:20:32.970" style="s2">we do not really today outside academic</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.690" end="00:20:36.539" style="s2">circles of of anthropologists and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.970" end="00:20:40.289" style="s2">sociologists we don&#39;t have a everyday</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.539" end="00:20:43.289" style="s2">language for this collective imaginary I</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.289" end="00:20:45.409" style="s2">mean for for for for all of us this</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.289" end="00:20:49.260" style="s2">collective imaginary is like the water</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.409" end="00:20:51.929" style="s2">for the fish yes it&#39;s something we swim</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.260" end="00:20:55.559" style="s2">in and we take it for granted but we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.929" end="00:20:59.370" style="s2">don&#39;t really think about it right but of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.559" end="00:21:02.039" style="s2">course what&#39;s different from from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.370" end="00:21:04.529" style="s2">fish in the water is that for the fish</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.039" end="00:21:07.799" style="s2">the water is a natural phenomenon that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.529" end="00:21:11.460" style="s2">it&#39;s not aware of whereas for us this</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.799" end="00:21:15.330" style="s2">collective imaginary is not a natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.460" end="00:21:21.860" style="s2">phenomenon it is a human-made phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.330" end="00:21:25.950" style="s2">but mostly made out of our unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.860" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">reproduction and slow evolution of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.950" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">we inherit from previous generations</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.620" end="00:21:38.460" style="s2">exactly I mean culture is part of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.210" end="00:21:41.010" style="s2">collective a imaginary so is our</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.460" end="00:21:42.690" style="s2">worldview everything at the market is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.010" end="00:21:44.850" style="s2">very important part of our collective</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.690" end="00:21:47.220" style="s2">imaginary previous collective</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.850" end="00:21:51.620" style="s2">imaginaries then of course God and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.220" end="00:21:55.080" style="s2">religion took up a large part of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.620" end="00:21:56.460" style="s2">collective imaginary and and what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.080" end="00:22:00.149" style="s2">interesting with these collective</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.460" end="00:22:03.630" style="s2">imaginaries is that we as humans have</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.149" end="00:22:08.120" style="s2">got this tremendous collective freedom</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.630" end="00:22:10.919" style="s2">to come up with almost any collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.120" end="00:22:13.980" style="s2">imaginary we could think of and if going</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.919" end="00:22:14.710" style="s2">back in history of course I mean going</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.980" end="00:22:16.600" style="s2">back just</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.710" end="00:22:19.799" style="s2">thousand years going going back a couple</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.600" end="00:22:23.500" style="s2">of thousand years there were literally</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.799" end="00:22:25.899" style="s2">sounds or tens of thousands independent</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.500" end="00:22:29.500" style="s2">cultures that we&#39;re living in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.899" end="00:22:31.779" style="s2">completely own collective imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.500" end="00:22:34.570" style="s2">and then through a bit of Darwinistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.779" end="00:22:37.809" style="s2">competition between various collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.570" end="00:22:40.390" style="s2">imaginary some proved stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.809" end="00:22:42.460" style="s2">survived like for example Judaism has</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.390" end="00:22:45.580" style="s2">been able to survive as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.460" end="00:22:49.270" style="s2">imaginary for for for such a long time</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.580" end="00:22:52.809" style="s2">whereas other competing collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.270" end="00:22:56.649" style="s2">imaginaries from 3,000 years ago has has</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.809" end="00:22:58.600" style="s2">gone extinct so so that is amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.649" end="00:23:01.029" style="s2">we have this freedom to create all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.600" end="00:23:05.080" style="s2">this but that also creates a problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.029" end="00:23:08.020" style="s2">because we need for a society to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.080" end="00:23:10.840" style="s2">function we need to live in the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.020" end="00:23:13.620" style="s2">roughly the same collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.840" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">for us even to be able to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.620" end="00:23:20.200" style="s2">communicate and direct the actions of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:24.809" style="s2">the collective so how do we sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.200" end="00:23:27.070" style="s2">fix this collective imaginary and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.809" end="00:23:30.100" style="s2">sociologists have come up and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.070" end="00:23:33.399" style="s2">one of the important postmodern insight</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.100" end="00:23:38.350" style="s2">is both the existence and the importance</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.399" end="00:23:40.659" style="s2">of these socially constructed realities</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.350" end="00:23:42.399" style="s2">and narratives involved and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.659" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">meta-narratives involved in these</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.399" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">structures to realize that these are</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">really human constructions but at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:54.010" style="s2">same time that we construct these</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:56.679" style="s2">realities these imaginaries we also have</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.010" end="00:24:00.520" style="s2">to fix them somewhere and that is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.679" end="00:24:03.640" style="s2">the sociologist sometimes calls the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.520" end="00:24:06.460" style="s2">ultimate authority yes in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.640" end="00:24:08.919" style="s2">collective imaginary and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.460" end="00:24:12.370" style="s2">the pre-modern world that ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.919" end="00:24:14.789" style="s2">authority was you usually God so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.370" end="00:24:17.080" style="s2">not just having a random world</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.789" end="00:24:19.929" style="s2">have you had the ultimate explanation</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.080" end="00:24:22.600" style="s2">why is the world in this way it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.929" end="00:24:24.580" style="s2">because God has created it in this way</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.600" end="00:24:28.060" style="s2">why should we believe in these Ten</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.580" end="00:24:30.550" style="s2">Commandments it&#39;s not just that Moses</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.060" end="00:24:32.200" style="s2">and he thought they were good no they</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.550" end="00:24:34.210" style="s2">need to be absolutely if we should fix</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.200" end="00:24:37.540" style="s2">the collective imaginary so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.210" end="00:24:39.670" style="s2">say they are given by God and then when</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.540" end="00:24:42.340" style="s2">we stop believing in God as an ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.670" end="00:24:47.410" style="s2">authority during the Enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:53.470" style="s2">we got this this rationalistic scientist</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.410" end="00:24:56.290" style="s2">scientific worldview then science took a</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.470" end="00:24:59.020" style="s2">bit the role in our society as this</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.290" end="00:25:01.960" style="s2">ultimate authority we were looking for</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.020" end="00:25:05.260" style="s2">the scientific explanation and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.960" end="00:25:08.530" style="s2">scientific answer but then of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.260" end="00:25:11.620" style="s2">with post modernity we start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.530" end="00:25:13.930" style="s2">that even science is in some important</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.620" end="00:25:18.250" style="s2">ways the social construct and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.930" end="00:25:20.410" style="s2">science do not have every answer so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.250" end="00:25:22.990" style="s2">happens then and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.410" end="00:25:25.570" style="s2">interestingly enough post modernity does</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.990" end="00:25:28.120" style="s2">not come up with its own ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.570" end="00:25:31.510" style="s2">authority and then as you pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.120" end="00:25:34.630" style="s2">earlier I argue in my book that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.510" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">that in the postmodern worldview where</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.630" end="00:25:39.850" style="s2">we realize thee that all these</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">collective imaginaries and narratives</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.850" end="00:25:47.770" style="s2">are human constructs then our social</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:50.020" style="s2">imaginary becomes completely not</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.770" end="00:25:52.540" style="s2">anchored any longer and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.020" end="00:25:55.000" style="s2">following yeah we need to find some sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.540" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">of anchor point and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.000" end="00:25:58.450" style="s2">market comes in and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:00.700" style="s2">postmodern philosophers are very</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.450" end="00:26:02.680" style="s2">critical to towards the market but</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.700" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">somehow the market sleeps in the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.680" end="00:26:07.420" style="s2">back door as a default because there is</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:10.750" style="s2">no other ultimate authority so then</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.420" end="00:26:14.340" style="s2">today it&#39;s natural when we ask why is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.750" end="00:26:18.250" style="s2">the world the way it is why is it that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.340" end="00:26:21.340" style="s2">an investment banker earns five or ten</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.250" end="00:26:25.240" style="s2">times the salary of a university</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.340" end="00:26:26.110" style="s2">professor well it&#39;s the market market</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.240" end="00:26:29.380" style="s2">has the answer</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.110" end="00:26:32.050" style="s2">so yeah what should we produce well the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.380" end="00:26:36.070" style="s2">market world will tell you that and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.050" end="00:26:38.380" style="s2">we started to put a lot of authority</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.070" end="00:26:40.360" style="s2">into the market and again a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.380" end="00:26:41.290" style="s2">too much and we are now starting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.360" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.290" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">so so then of course the question</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:50.620" style="s2">becomes done so if we had this</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:53.920" style="s2">pre-modern world with its collective</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.620" end="00:26:58.020" style="s2">imaginary and with God as the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.920" end="00:27:01.290" style="s2">authority then we had the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.020" end="00:27:04.210" style="s2">with science as the ultimate authority</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.290" end="00:27:07.870" style="s2">now a postmodern transition where the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.210" end="00:27:10.330" style="s2">market has taken up too much power and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.870" end="00:27:13.180" style="s2">are we starting to realize that what</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.330" end="00:27:16.180" style="s2">will be the next step what will come out</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.180" end="00:27:19.240" style="s2">of this what sort of worldview what sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.180" end="00:27:22.630" style="s2">of social imaginary and and what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.240" end="00:27:25.960" style="s2">ultimate authority will will emerge here</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.630" end="00:27:30.460" style="s2">and I wish I could have had an answer on</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.960" end="00:27:34.930" style="s2">that I wish I could have an answer on</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.460" end="00:27:37.570" style="s2">that but but you can only speculate but</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.930" end="00:27:39.880" style="s2">but just realizing that we are on this</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.570" end="00:27:43.960" style="s2">evolutionary path and that we are at</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.880" end="00:27:47.770" style="s2">this very very critical point in history</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.960" end="00:27:50.590" style="s2">because the previous times where we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.770" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">had civilizations collapsing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.590" end="00:27:56.850" style="s2">collective imaginaries collapsing there</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:59.260" style="s2">has always been other competing</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.850" end="00:28:01.330" style="s2">contenders that have been sort of then</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.260" end="00:28:04.690" style="s2">given the space to rise up and take the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.330" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">power of our civilization but now we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.690" end="00:28:09.490" style="s2">really interconnected in one global</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:12.970" style="s2">civilization and that again from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.490" end="00:28:16.270" style="s2">virus right now that becomes evident to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.970" end="00:28:19.260" style="s2">everyone that we we only have one world</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.270" end="00:28:23.320" style="s2">and we more or less only have one</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.260" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">collective imaginary as well now and if</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.320" end="00:28:31.060" style="s2">that one is falling apart I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:35.350" style="s2">that then we cannot just trust natural</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.060" end="00:28:40.530" style="s2">selection and random walk we actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.350" end="00:28:42.490" style="s2">need to to make a conscious step into</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.530" end="00:28:44.620" style="s2">something new and that will be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.490" end="00:28:47.350" style="s2">collective leap a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.620" end="00:28:50.260" style="s2">collective leap of faith into something</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.350" end="00:28:54.340" style="s2">that we do not know what it is but we</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.260" end="00:29:02.500" style="s2">need to dare to let go</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.340" end="00:29:05.260" style="s2">and and collectively take a leap that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.500" end="00:29:07.450" style="s2">was a fantastic synoptic integration of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.260" end="00:29:09.880" style="s2">your argument thank you for that will</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.450" end="00:29:17.320" style="s2">you lay that out a couple things came to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.880" end="00:29:23.230" style="s2">mind you know as within a collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.320" end="00:29:25.929" style="s2">imaginary and how deeply interwoven with</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.230" end="00:29:30.090" style="s2">you know you know interpersonal and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.929" end="00:29:33.190" style="s2">intrapersonal transformation and and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.090" end="00:29:34.539" style="s2">I&#39;ll use a term that I&#39;m happy with but</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.190" end="00:29:36.250" style="s2">we don&#39;t have an alternate one right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.539" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">there seems to be an important spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.250" end="00:29:42.100" style="s2">dimension to everything and we have that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:45.820" style="s2">even things that seem so bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.100" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">like the market have a lot of almost</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.820" end="00:29:51.580" style="s2">numinous like deity aspect when people</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:54.970" style="s2">serve the market and the might have yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.580" end="00:29:58.120" style="s2">the bars the way the world is and so it</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.970" end="00:30:01.990" style="s2">seems to me that part of what we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.120" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">talking about then is well at least all</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.990" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">they can point it out but that arguing</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:10.270" style="s2">for it is that and I know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">claiming this you&#39;re not claiming we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.270" end="00:30:14.020" style="s2">unlearn everything that these previous</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:16.510" style="s2">revolutions have given us we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.020" end="00:30:20.250" style="s2">go back like to an indigenous world we</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.510" end="00:30:22.990" style="s2">can&#39;t go back to an axial world right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.250" end="00:30:25.240" style="s2">similarly we can&#39;t unlearn science so it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.990" end="00:30:29.740" style="s2">sounds like part of the project has to</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.240" end="00:30:31.899" style="s2">be to overcome some of the divides that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.740" end="00:30:34.390" style="s2">were so fundamental to the grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.899" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">the collective imaginary that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.390" end="00:30:37.809" style="s2">falling down that&#39;s falling down like</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:40.330" style="s2">the divides between science and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.809" end="00:30:43.149" style="s2">spirituality the device reminded body</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.330" end="00:30:45.460" style="s2">the divides between you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.149" end="00:30:47.770" style="s2">subjectivity and objectivity the divides</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.460" end="00:30:50.500" style="s2">between you know my own personal space</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.770" end="00:30:54.840" style="s2">and and my own personal cognition and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.500" end="00:30:57.149" style="s2">distributed cognition and what I see is</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.840" end="00:30:59.559" style="s2">one of the differences eyes these</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.149" end="00:31:02.620" style="s2">post-modernism called those questions</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.559" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">called those divides into question but</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.620" end="00:31:06.340" style="s2">what I see a lot of people doing your</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:07.100" style="s2">work my work that people are talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.340" end="00:31:09.110" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.100" end="00:31:11.029" style="s2">with is we&#39;re trying to go from oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.110" end="00:31:12.919" style="s2">yes those divisions don&#39;t work but</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.029" end="00:31:14.630" style="s2">simply criticizing them is insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.919" end="00:31:17.679" style="s2">what we have to do is actually what does</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.630" end="00:31:21.380" style="s2">it look like to go beyond those device</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:24.019" style="s2">which back science spirituality try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.380" end="00:31:26.330" style="s2">stitch back you know that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.019" end="00:31:34.970" style="s2">mind of the body and the person in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.330" end="00:31:36.919" style="s2">world and so although I don&#39;t I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.970" end="00:31:41.570" style="s2">that there is a that there&#39;s a both/and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.919" end="00:31:43.820" style="s2">situation yes yeah here again we need we</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.570" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">need to go beyond the divides but then</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.820" end="00:31:51.169" style="s2">also the divides can some sometimes be</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:53.240" style="s2">be be helpful and what we definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.169" end="00:31:57.799" style="s2">need to do is that that in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.240" end="00:32:01.850" style="s2">postmodern insights that that all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.799" end="00:32:05.960" style="s2">these things are just human construct</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.850" end="00:32:07.789" style="s2">we tend on tend to mix everything and</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.960" end="00:32:10.250" style="s2">put everything on the same footing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.789" end="00:32:12.860" style="s2">your sailor things like every</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.250" end="00:32:14.750" style="s2">perspective is equally valid in every</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.860" end="00:32:17.809" style="s2">situation and things like that and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.750" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">and that is of course not the case so</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.809" end="00:32:29.500" style="s2">for example if we look at our world</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:34.669" style="s2">today so today for me as an individual I</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.500" end="00:32:39.019" style="s2">am equally dependent on air to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.669" end="00:32:41.299" style="s2">on oxygen and on money to survive in</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.019" end="00:32:45.139" style="s2">today&#39;s society I need to have oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.299" end="00:32:46.629" style="s2">and I need to have money but we also</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.139" end="00:32:49.639" style="s2">need to understand that they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.629" end="00:32:54.580" style="s2">fundamentally two different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.639" end="00:32:57.350" style="s2">things they are ontologically different</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.580" end="00:33:00.529" style="s2">even if I as an individual me as an</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.350" end="00:33:05.019" style="s2">individual I am totally dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.529" end="00:33:08.690" style="s2">oxygen and on money we as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.019" end="00:33:11.629" style="s2">even if every person on earth came</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.690" end="00:33:15.129" style="s2">together and we decided that we do not</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.629" end="00:33:19.129" style="s2">want as humans to be dependent on oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.129" end="00:33:20.920" style="s2">we we can&#39;t do it we can&#39;t do it but if</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.129" end="00:33:24.130" style="s2">we came together everyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.920" end="00:33:26.950" style="s2">on the earth or even just everyone in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.130" end="00:33:29.350" style="s2">nation-state and said we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.950" end="00:33:31.990" style="s2">be depending on money any long we want</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.350" end="00:33:34.540" style="s2">to invent some new mechanism to allocate</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.990" end="00:33:37.800" style="s2">the goods in society money would be gone</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.540" end="00:33:40.930" style="s2">tomorrow so it&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.800" end="00:33:43.090" style="s2">difference between between a natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.930" end="00:33:46.090" style="s2">phenomenon like oxygen and the socially</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.090" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">constructed thing as money but what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.090" end="00:33:58.450" style="s2">sad yes and is that in many cases we mix</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:34:02.110" style="s2">this up so we tend to believe that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.450" end="00:34:05.890" style="s2">the planetary boundaries is something</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.110" end="00:34:06.850" style="s2">that is up for negotiation whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.890" end="00:34:10.330" style="s2">market forces</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.850" end="00:34:12.100" style="s2">we just need to obey well of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.330" end="00:34:13.810" style="s2">completely different I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.100" end="00:34:15.490" style="s2">planetary boundaries will always be</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.810" end="00:34:20.169" style="s2">there whereas the market forces is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.490" end="00:34:22.360" style="s2">actually under our collective agency we</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.169" end="00:34:27.220" style="s2">can change them but we need to do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.360" end="00:34:30.070" style="s2">on a on a collective level so so yes in</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.220" end="00:34:33.790" style="s2">one way the distinctions are important</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.070" end="00:34:37.659" style="s2">but then on another way of course every</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.790" end="00:34:39.970" style="s2">distinction is Justin and some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.659" end="00:34:42.370" style="s2">arbitrary perspective of the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.970" end="00:34:45.480" style="s2">because at the end of the day as you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.370" end="00:34:48.880" style="s2">point out there is only one</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.480" end="00:34:53.669" style="s2">interconnected system it&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.880" end="00:34:57.940" style="s2">system but it&#39;s very very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.669" end="00:35:01.740" style="s2">comprehend and take decisions if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.940" end="00:35:04.660" style="s2">need to keep the whole of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.740" end="00:35:07.540" style="s2">from Big Bang until the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.660" end="00:35:12.850" style="s2">universe in mind so then of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.540" end="00:35:15.850" style="s2">a very it&#39;s a strong tool we have in for</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.850" end="00:35:18.490" style="s2">example science and physics to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.850" end="00:35:20.950" style="s2">understand that if we are looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.490" end="00:35:23.980" style="s2">stone falling to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.950" end="00:35:26.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t think actually to understand</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.980" end="00:35:29.250" style="s2">that particular aspect needs to take</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.920" end="00:35:32.380" style="s2">everything in the universe into account</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.250" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">there are no gods interfering in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.380" end="00:35:36.590" style="s2">the stone does not have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:39.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a very simple equation and of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.590" end="00:35:42.140" style="s2">course that is strong so sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.950" end="00:35:44.420" style="s2">very it&#39;s it&#39;s very powerful and very</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.140" end="00:35:47.120" style="s2">strong to have these analytical ability</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:50.510" style="s2">to divide this complex world into small</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.120" end="00:35:53.840" style="s2">small pieces but then in other cases</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.510" end="00:35:58.450" style="s2">it&#39;s devastating and we need and we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.840" end="00:36:01.160" style="s2">to see it all as a as a one system</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.450" end="00:36:04.660" style="s2">interacting and that is that system also</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.160" end="00:36:08.420" style="s2">includes the for example the of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.660" end="00:36:09.800" style="s2">subjective experiences of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.420" end="00:36:12.620" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.800" end="00:36:15.170" style="s2">so in this totality of the world there</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.620" end="00:36:18.410" style="s2">is there are those natural object</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.170" end="00:36:21.620" style="s2">objects there is our subjective</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.410" end="00:36:23.480" style="s2">experiences that has got real impact on</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.620" end="00:36:26.120" style="s2">our action and therefore impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.480" end="00:36:29.360" style="s2">world but then also the compass the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.120" end="00:36:32.750" style="s2">collective subjectivity that we have put</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.360" end="00:36:38.120" style="s2">into the collective imaginary and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.750" end="00:36:41.450" style="s2">reified into some sort of social reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.120" end="00:36:45.260" style="s2">that meets us as individuals as almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.450" end="00:37:07.670" style="s2">as objective reality as as the stone or</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.260" end="00:37:09.710" style="s2">the water introduced I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.670" end="00:37:11.450" style="s2">that simply letting the complexity fall</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.710" end="00:37:16.760" style="s2">away is not what we want the criticality</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.450" end="00:37:19.640" style="s2">to give us so what what what I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.760" end="00:37:21.770" style="s2">saying is you know there&#39;s there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.640" end="00:37:24.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know there&#39;s a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.770" end="00:37:26.810" style="s2">aspect there&#39;s a like I said this</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.770" end="00:37:29.630" style="s2">broadly spiritual part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.810" end="00:37:30.650" style="s2">understanding what I&#39;m proposing to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.630" end="00:37:32.930" style="s2">is what are the meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.650" end="00:37:36.500" style="s2">understanding of spirituality is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.930" end="00:37:38.420" style="s2">recognition and reappropriation of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.500" end="00:37:41.030" style="s2">agency within the collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.420" end="00:37:45.170" style="s2">and turning back towards the project of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.030" end="00:37:47.300" style="s2">the skating with this and this and this</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.170" end="00:37:47.930" style="s2">and then and but then what you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.300" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">saying it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.930" end="00:37:54.350" style="s2">addition to that is we have to you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:56.930" style="s2">to take great ontological care in how</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.350" end="00:37:59.420" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do the the both end</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.930" end="00:38:03.530" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get beyond we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.420" end="00:38:07.220" style="s2">to simply remove the distinction that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.530" end="00:38:09.050" style="s2">are actually necessary for for you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.220" end="00:38:13.030" style="s2">appropriately engaging in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.050" end="00:38:13.030" style="s2">reappropriation we don&#39;t work inflate</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.970" end="00:38:22.870" style="s2">yes I think yes I think that in in in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.490" end="00:38:26.900" style="s2">post modernity we have this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.870" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">relativistic perspective title that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.900" end="00:38:34.450" style="s2">every perspective is equally valid I</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:39.320" style="s2">think the next step is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.450" end="00:38:41.600" style="s2">integrated perspectivism saying that for</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.320" end="00:38:43.700" style="s2">any problem the more angles the more</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.600" end="00:38:46.760" style="s2">perspectives you can view this this</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.700" end="00:38:50.290" style="s2">situation from the more information you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.760" end="00:38:57.350" style="s2">will get out but it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.290" end="00:39:02.150" style="s2">discern the how important the different</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.350" end="00:39:05.150" style="s2">angles are in on analyzing a certain a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:07.850" style="s2">certain phenomena so it&#39;s not that then</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.150" end="00:39:10.010" style="s2">yeah you need as many perspectives as</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.850" end="00:39:12.410" style="s2">possible but then it&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.010" end="00:39:16.790" style="s2">complicated and just float throwing them</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.410" end="00:39:21.320" style="s2">all in in in in a bucket and picking one</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.790" end="00:39:24.290" style="s2">randomly no you need to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.320" end="00:39:38.200" style="s2">sort of a information each perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.290" end="00:39:39.830" style="s2">is best at best at providing different</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.200" end="00:39:41.930" style="s2">perspectives given to you by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.830" end="00:39:44.540" style="s2">different disciplines the entities they</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.930" end="00:39:46.280" style="s2">look at the language they use the type</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.540" end="00:39:47.570" style="s2">of methods they use and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.280" end="00:39:49.640" style="s2">trying to reduce them all to one</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.570" end="00:39:52.340" style="s2">modernist thing you&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.640" end="00:39:54.140" style="s2">reduce all the data for science or like</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.340" end="00:39:57.050" style="s2">but what you&#39;re trying to do is afford</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.140" end="00:39:58.630" style="s2">you know a conceptual a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.050" end="00:40:01.690" style="s2">vocabulary Rio Grande</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.630" end="00:40:03.099" style="s2">so that instead of them right right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.690" end="00:40:04.690" style="s2">not trying to reduce them all in one</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.099" end="00:40:05.859" style="s2">perspective and I&#39;m not just saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.690" end="00:40:07.779" style="s2">although they have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.859" end="00:40:09.579" style="s2">each other I&#39;m trying to afford a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.779" end="00:40:12.250" style="s2">synoptic integration for that they can</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.579" end="00:40:14.200" style="s2">talk to each other mutually inform and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.250" end="00:40:16.599" style="s2">mutually transform each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.200" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">so I think you get the date day right</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.599" end="00:40:20.559" style="s2">that&#39;s how at least I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:22.869" style="s2">understand how we can steer between you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.559" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">know trying to get a mono perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.869" end="00:40:26.829" style="s2">just saying well all the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:28.150" style="s2">they they&#39;re only commensal they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.829" end="00:40:30.009" style="s2">have anything to do with each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.150" end="00:40:32.849" style="s2">they&#39;re all equally good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.009" end="00:40:35.529" style="s2">fundamental presupposition behind</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.849" end="00:40:38.049" style="s2">they&#39;re actually atomically isolated</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.529" end="00:40:40.779" style="s2">from each other I know I think the mono</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.049" end="00:40:43.960" style="s2">perspective and the atomic we isolated</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.779" end="00:40:48.069" style="s2">idea I think those are both false yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.960" end="00:40:50.680" style="s2">for reasons and so trying to get finding</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.069" end="00:40:52.420" style="s2">as you say you know you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.680" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">try to do something you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.420" end="00:40:57.430" style="s2">remember the differences because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">important because you know neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.430" end="00:41:00.309" style="s2">can do things that psychology just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:02.200" style="s2">do and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.309" end="00:41:04.690" style="s2">but they also need to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.200" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">they need to be able to transform and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.690" end="00:41:09.160" style="s2">inform each other and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:11.410" style="s2">model I&#39;m trying to get you know what</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.160" end="00:41:15.250" style="s2">how do you try to go forward we try to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:17.049" style="s2">take that that skillset of bridging so</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.250" end="00:41:20.380" style="s2">we can get you know this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.049" end="00:41:22.779" style="s2">convergence between perspectives and see</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.380" end="00:41:25.240" style="s2">we can scale that up to the more</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.779" end="00:41:26.890" style="s2">comprehensive perspectives that are in</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.240" end="00:41:29.529" style="s2">our culture right now that&#39;s nice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.890" end="00:41:32.380" style="s2">all I&#39;m trying to a word of way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.529" end="00:41:36.460" style="s2">responding for people yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.380" end="00:41:39.819" style="s2">and and as as as many writers have</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.460" end="00:41:43.180" style="s2">pointed out so far in in history when we</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.819" end="00:41:47.950" style="s2">have gone from one collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.180" end="00:41:53.470" style="s2">or one paradigm of of worldview to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.950" end="00:41:57.759" style="s2">next one but we have usually completely</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.470" end="00:42:00.069" style="s2">disregarded the the previous worldview</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.759" end="00:42:02.440" style="s2">and we have even developed allergy</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.069" end="00:42:04.690" style="s2">against it it&#39;s a bit like it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.440" end="00:42:08.200" style="s2">like also when we as humans grow I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.690" end="00:42:11.890" style="s2">the teenager does not at all what to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.200" end="00:42:13.109" style="s2">recognize the child he or she was three</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.890" end="00:42:16.239" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.109" end="00:42:18.939" style="s2">but as a really mature person you should</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.239" end="00:42:23.079" style="s2">be able to integrate yes your experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.939" end="00:42:25.959" style="s2">is to live without these reactions so so</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.079" end="00:42:29.709" style="s2">when we went from and from a tribal</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.959" end="00:42:32.469" style="s2">society into a pre-modern monotheistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.709" end="00:42:34.929" style="s2">religious society everything tribal was</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.469" end="00:42:36.910" style="s2">by Barry and and was sort of pushed away</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.929" end="00:42:40.089" style="s2">and when we went during the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.910" end="00:42:42.219" style="s2">Enlightenment into the rational</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.089" end="00:42:44.799" style="s2">scientific worldview everything from</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.219" end="00:42:46.719" style="s2">religion and spirituality through now</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.799" end="00:42:48.839" style="s2">and again with the postmodern way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.719" end="00:42:52.150" style="s2">thinking then we are throwing out</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.839" end="00:42:53.859" style="s2">science and and and everything so what</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.150" end="00:42:56.559" style="s2">we need to do now there&#39;s a starting</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.859" end="00:42:58.179" style="s2">point at least of course as many have</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.559" end="00:43:02.410" style="s2">pointed out is that we need to try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.179" end="00:43:06.519" style="s2">integrate the insights the very strong</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.410" end="00:43:08.769" style="s2">insights of all these different ways or</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.519" end="00:43:13.170" style="s2">modalities or perspectives of viewing</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.769" end="00:43:17.619" style="s2">the human life and society and situation</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.170" end="00:43:20.109" style="s2">without bringing in the limitations and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.619" end="00:43:21.400" style="s2">try to get some sort of integral and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.109" end="00:43:25.390" style="s2">that&#39;s of course very integral comes</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.400" end="00:43:27.039" style="s2">from an integral perspective on on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.390" end="00:43:29.469" style="s2">world but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.039" end="00:43:32.109" style="s2">then we also have that then we also have</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.469" end="00:43:34.509" style="s2">this emergent phenomena that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.109" end="00:43:36.429" style="s2">really know where what what it is so it</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.509" end="00:43:39.789" style="s2">will just it may not just be an</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.429" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">integration of this as some there will</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.789" end="00:43:52.170" style="s2">be something more elegant emerging after</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:56.170" style="s2">this as well they simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.170" end="00:43:57.609" style="s2">integrate and differentiate complexify</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.170" end="00:43:59.910" style="s2">that&#39;s when you get emergent functions</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.609" end="00:44:02.829" style="s2">and Gabi I think trying to afford</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.910" end="00:44:06.999" style="s2">complexification within the synoptic</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.829" end="00:44:09.640" style="s2">integration is a way of trying to not</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.999" end="00:44:15.400" style="s2">cause but trying to afford that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.640" end="00:44:16.809" style="s2">emergence make a space and that there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.400" end="00:44:22.359" style="s2">where I think that the connection</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.809" end="00:44:25.349" style="s2">between our personal inner growth and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.359" end="00:44:29.339" style="s2">development the complexification</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.349" end="00:44:31.829" style="s2">our cognitive system or our total sort</p>

<p begin="00:44:31.829" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">total inner system plays an important</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.769" end="00:44:44.130" style="s2">role in facilitating the transition the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:47.940" style="s2">break through to a new more complex and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.130" end="00:44:50.549" style="s2">perhaps also more elegant way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.940" end="00:44:56.700" style="s2">organizing our society a more complex</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.549" end="00:44:59.789" style="s2">and elegant way because in in any any of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.700" end="00:45:06.029" style="s2">these different states of the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.789" end="00:45:10.430" style="s2">of human human society there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.029" end="00:45:14.789" style="s2">a possibility for enough many people in</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.430" end="00:45:17.729" style="s2">the population to actively engage with</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.789" end="00:45:20.279" style="s2">the culture and with a collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.729" end="00:45:24.930" style="s2">imaginary otherwise it would just be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.279" end="00:45:27.539" style="s2">dead dead book or something you need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.930" end="00:45:29.069" style="s2">have so you need to have some and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.539" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know where where this you need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.069" end="00:45:34.339" style="s2">have five or ten percent at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:38.430" style="s2">population that are really on a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.339" end="00:45:42.089" style="s2">cognitive and emotional level of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.430" end="00:45:47.539" style="s2">complexity to really understand and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.089" end="00:45:47.539" style="s2">engage and actively not not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.719" end="00:45:56.279" style="s2">passively reproduce but actively be able</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.900" end="00:45:59.190" style="s2">to reproduce and develop this so I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.279" end="00:46:02.519" style="s2">that the most important thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.190" end="00:46:09.150" style="s2">could actually do to help this emergence</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.519" end="00:46:12.059" style="s2">of a new more complex civilization is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.150" end="00:46:14.759" style="s2">again just like we did in Scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.059" end="00:46:19.130" style="s2">and the Nordic secret then the Nordic</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.759" end="00:46:26.089" style="s2">secret is to help a critical number of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.130" end="00:46:29.910" style="s2">people to mature enough to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.089" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">participate in actively participate as</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.910" end="00:46:38.190" style="s2">co-creators as enlightened as conscious</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:39.190" style="s2">co-creators of this new society this</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.190" end="00:46:42.579" style="s2">Newark</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.190" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">collective imaginary and again just like</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.579" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">with a with the Nordic society this the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:53.290" style="s2">the amount of people necessary I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:56.140" style="s2">is dependent on their distribution in</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.290" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">society and the beauty with the Nordic</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.140" end="00:47:00.849" style="s2">secret was that these 10% of each</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:06.160" style="s2">generation that were able to participate</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.849" end="00:47:10.660" style="s2">in these personal development activities</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.160" end="00:47:15.369" style="s2">retreats they were actually from all</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.660" end="00:47:17.550" style="s2">sorts of social backgrounds so they were</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.369" end="00:47:20.440" style="s2">middle class but also a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.550" end="00:47:22.589" style="s2">working-class and from the farming part</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.440" end="00:47:26.829" style="s2">of population so you ended up with 10%</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.589" end="00:47:31.060" style="s2">fairly evenly distributed in society and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.829" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">I think that that has much much larger</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.060" end="00:47:39.510" style="s2">possibility to succeed and even having</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:42.760" style="s2">20% in some sort of isolated elite of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.510" end="00:47:46.270" style="s2">society so that&#39;s where we are again</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.760" end="00:47:49.230" style="s2">helping enough many people to develop</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.270" end="00:47:52.359" style="s2">the inner capacities to become conscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.230" end="00:48:07.420" style="s2">co-creators of the next level Honor</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.359" end="00:48:11.170" style="s2">Society yeah I usually say that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.420" end="00:48:14.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t see the the Nordic secret the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.170" end="00:48:16.900" style="s2">Nordic experience as a blueprint for</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.410" end="00:48:19.089" style="s2">what we should do today we could</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.900" end="00:48:21.700" style="s2">certainly do this in other ways we might</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.089" end="00:48:24.430" style="s2">not have to create these reach small</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.700" end="00:48:26.200" style="s2">retreat sensors out in nature even if I</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.430" end="00:48:28.030" style="s2">believe strong in that concept and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.200" end="00:48:31.990" style="s2">is what we are doing at the Oak Island</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.030" end="00:48:34.060" style="s2">foundation but weak it could be done in</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.990" end="00:48:36.780" style="s2">different in different ways today and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.060" end="00:48:40.619" style="s2">and I&#39;m for example involved in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.780" end="00:48:45.069" style="s2">digital platform you have to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.619" end="00:48:47.020" style="s2">personal development called 29k dot-org</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.069" end="00:48:50.290" style="s2">so I think that we might be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.020" end="00:48:52.320" style="s2">to use digital tools to help facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.290" end="00:48:54.630" style="s2">this so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.320" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">blueprint but it is certainly a case</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.630" end="00:49:00.290" style="s2">study yes showing that this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:03.300" style="s2">fantasy this has actually worked and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.290" end="00:49:05.730" style="s2">and it worked differently but he worked</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.300" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">well in both Denmark and Norway and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.730" end="00:49:11.220" style="s2">Sweden and that was three different</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:13.080" style="s2">implementations and fairly independent</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.220" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">implementation but about the same time</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.080" end="00:49:18.930" style="s2">and it worked beautifully in all three</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:20.970" style="s2">and we and we still see even though</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.930" end="00:49:23.010" style="s2">we&#39;ve forgotten about this and they even</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.970" end="00:49:24.870" style="s2">if we are starting to lose it I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.010" end="00:49:26.940" style="s2">first one to say that is well that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.870" end="00:49:29.160" style="s2">are starting to do sit-in in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.940" end="00:49:39.180" style="s2">Scandinavian countries we still see the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.160" end="00:49:41.370" style="s2">effect this the effort was it was not</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.180" end="00:49:48.630" style="s2">just one culture but three different</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.370" end="00:49:52.530" style="s2">countries is almost like a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.630" end="00:49:54.540" style="s2">study on a full-scale sighting in three</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.530" end="00:49:56.580" style="s2">different societies a bit different</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.540" end="00:49:58.650" style="s2">implementation and then measure this</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.580" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">over fifty hundred years and see what</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.650" end="00:50:04.080" style="s2">happens and you can see that it worked</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:06.690" style="s2">of course now of course now this was</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.080" end="00:50:08.970" style="s2">going from a pre-modern society into a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.690" end="00:50:11.940" style="s2">modern society now we&#39;re going from a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.970" end="00:50:15.090" style="s2">modern or postmodern society into some</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.940" end="00:50:17.850" style="s2">something new so then this becomes even</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.090" end="00:50:20.730" style="s2">more important but perhaps also more</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.730" end="00:50:26.100" style="s2">because this becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.210" end="00:50:29.100" style="s2">complex and you need to be able to hold</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.100" end="00:50:32.030" style="s2">more and more perspectives and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.100" end="00:50:34.380" style="s2">emotions and we are going from a</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.030" end="00:50:37.950" style="s2">monocultural society into a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.380" end="00:50:41.850" style="s2">multicultural society and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.950" end="00:50:54.770" style="s2">complexified things a lot so this</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.850" end="00:50:54.770" style="s2">becomes even more important down yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.070" end="00:50:59.970" style="s2">you&#39;re not proposing this as some rigid</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.440" end="00:51:02.310" style="s2">template that we just transposed from</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.970" end="00:51:06.210" style="s2">the past and now you&#39;re taking it as</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.310" end="00:51:10.170" style="s2">right as really as you said you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.210" end="00:51:12.420" style="s2">the powerfully comprehensive historical</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.170" end="00:51:13.859" style="s2">case study that tells us that something</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.420" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">like this is possible and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.859" end="00:51:18.750" style="s2">alternative to the kind of utopianism</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:19.349" style="s2">you&#39;re not oh here&#39;s my vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.750" end="00:51:21.420" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.349" end="00:51:24.839" style="s2">and I can guarantee that if you just do</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.420" end="00:51:26.820" style="s2">X Y and Zed but if we just do this right</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.839" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a toilet area look you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.820" end="00:51:31.830" style="s2">doing that at all you&#39;re saying no no</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:34.349" style="s2">I&#39;m saying we&#39;re going through a change</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.830" end="00:51:37.560" style="s2">there&#39;s something deeply analogous let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.349" end="00:51:39.930" style="s2">try and make the analogy as best we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.560" end="00:51:42.170" style="s2">to where we are right now I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.930" end="00:51:44.010" style="s2">a very important or idiom to both a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.170" end="00:51:46.650" style="s2">nostalgia it says no let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.010" end="00:51:49.290" style="s2">somehow let&#39;s get back to the develop</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.650" end="00:51:51.690" style="s2">this world right or no no utopianism it</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.290" end="00:51:54.180" style="s2">said I know for sure what the future</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.690" end="00:51:56.970" style="s2">looks like it denies the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.180" end="00:52:03.000" style="s2">your job and that and that is also of</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.970" end="00:52:05.940" style="s2">course on why this transition is is in</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.000" end="00:52:08.310" style="s2">many ways more more difficult than the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.940" end="00:52:11.339" style="s2">previous one from pre modernity into</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.310" end="00:52:14.550" style="s2">modernity and it&#39;s not just that we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.339" end="00:52:16.290" style="s2">these sort of emergence the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.550" end="00:52:21.390" style="s2">phenomena that we need to leave leave</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.290" end="00:52:24.869" style="s2">space for it&#39;s not just that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.390" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">technological rapid rapid evolution that</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.869" end="00:52:32.220" style="s2">we do not really know what society what</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">the technological possibilities will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.220" end="00:52:39.720" style="s2">in just 10 years and I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:42.869" style="s2">future arrangement of society and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.720" end="00:52:45.540" style="s2">especially the next implementation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.869" end="00:52:47.220" style="s2">the market and of democracy I think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.540" end="00:52:50.099" style="s2">that will be very much dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.220" end="00:52:53.460" style="s2">development in for example blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.099" end="00:52:56.150" style="s2">technology and another thing so exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.460" end="00:52:59.220" style="s2">what this will be we will truly be an</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.150" end="00:53:01.530" style="s2">emergent but there&#39;s one more thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.220" end="00:53:04.740" style="s2">complicates things and and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.530" end="00:53:08.820" style="s2">a hundred years ago it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.740" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">possible at least plausible to argue for</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.820" end="00:53:16.530" style="s2">a utopia saying that that this is where</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:19.170" style="s2">we want to be in 20 years so in 50 50</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.530" end="00:53:19.890" style="s2">years let&#39;s go there and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.170" end="00:53:24.690" style="s2">easier</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.890" end="00:53:28.319" style="s2">to bring up support for an idea when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.690" end="00:53:30.989" style="s2">can clearly articulate an end state and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.319" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">of course we can&#39;t do that because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.989" end="00:53:36.150" style="s2">the rapid technological development</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:38.849" style="s2">because of the emergent properties of of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.150" end="00:53:43.579" style="s2">the future but also because I believe</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.849" end="00:53:48.450" style="s2">that the future will be that rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.579" end="00:53:51.539" style="s2">constantly evolving that instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.450" end="00:53:53.339" style="s2">future being a state I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.539" end="00:54:01.109" style="s2">realize that the future will be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.339" end="00:54:05.309" style="s2">process ok so our idea about the future</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.109" end="00:54:07.559" style="s2">is not about a future state it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.309" end="00:54:10.289" style="s2">not about supporting the emergence of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.559" end="00:54:14.220" style="s2">future state it&#39;s it&#39;s supporting the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.289" end="00:54:17.880" style="s2">emergence of a good future evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.220" end="00:54:20.789" style="s2">process where we become self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.880" end="00:54:24.359" style="s2">about the importance of integrating the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.789" end="00:54:27.569" style="s2">inner personal development and actively</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.359" end="00:54:29.970" style="s2">integrating the co-creation the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.569" end="00:54:45.749" style="s2">co-creation of our collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.970" end="00:54:49.190" style="s2">as well which we&#39;re trying to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.749" end="00:54:52.499" style="s2">state the completion the production</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.190" end="00:54:58.650" style="s2">though those ways of understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.499" end="00:55:00.989" style="s2">we&#39;re going to move into the future but</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.650" end="00:55:02.660" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult because again as you</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.989" end="00:55:06.900" style="s2">mentioned many times in your theories</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.660" end="00:55:10.259" style="s2">our human mind is not made for for these</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.900" end="00:55:12.180" style="s2">things I mean we want to see the simple</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.259" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">solution we want to see a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.180" end="00:55:15.720" style="s2">where we are going we want to know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:21.660" style="s2">is right and what is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.720" end="00:55:24.900" style="s2">so it puts a huge demand on not not only</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.660" end="00:55:27.480" style="s2">the thought leaders of societies and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.900" end="00:55:30.450" style="s2">philosophers but also really on every</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.480" end="00:55:33.640" style="s2">person in society that that should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.450" end="00:55:44.069" style="s2">part of the democratic process</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.640" end="00:55:47.950" style="s2">of society about so education and our</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.069" end="00:55:50.680" style="s2">support this society supports for for</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.950" end="00:55:53.410" style="s2">everyone to be able to develop the inner</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.680" end="00:55:55.809" style="s2">capacities to be part of this I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.410" end="00:55:59.319" style="s2">that is super important if we are not</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.809" end="00:56:03.700" style="s2">going to end up with a two-tier society</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.319" end="00:56:05.890" style="s2">or something like that well you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.700" end="00:56:08.170" style="s2">just talking everybody should know this</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.890" end="00:56:10.989" style="s2">no Thomas is out there trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.170" end="00:56:13.329" style="s2">actually you know put it into into</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.989" end="00:56:15.609" style="s2">existence all these things that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.329" end="00:56:18.609" style="s2">talking about you should know that time</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.609" end="00:56:20.910" style="s2">you know in a sense you&#39;re running a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.609" end="00:56:23.619" style="s2">of the case studies that need to be run</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.910" end="00:56:27.670" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s what we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.619" end="00:56:30.039" style="s2">now we need to prototype yeah we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.670" end="00:56:35.279" style="s2">experiment that we need to prototype I</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.039" end="00:56:37.720" style="s2">mean what is it like to be creating a</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.279" end="00:56:40.900" style="s2">collating space for example where where</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.720" end="00:56:43.269" style="s2">you try to create a culture that is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.900" end="00:56:45.759" style="s2">deliberative developmental culture a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.269" end="00:56:48.369" style="s2">culture that is actually holding</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.759" end="00:56:50.650" style="s2">everyone&#39;s development and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.369" end="00:56:52.809" style="s2">bring out the best in every first how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.650" end="00:56:54.819" style="s2">you create such a culture on the small</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.809" end="00:56:57.130" style="s2">scale how do you experiment with these</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.819" end="00:56:59.380" style="s2">things so that&#39;s it&#39;s funny it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.130" end="00:57:04.109" style="s2">it they&#39;re there to work with these</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.380" end="00:57:09.910" style="s2">things this has been really really great</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.109" end="00:57:11.980" style="s2">you know you were able to well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.910" end="00:57:16.749" style="s2">grateful that you were here and you do</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.980" end="00:57:18.940" style="s2">so you articulate your vision so much</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.749" end="00:57:21.099" style="s2">because I want more people to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.940" end="00:57:23.380" style="s2">of your work and what you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.099" end="00:57:27.059" style="s2">and and also as I just mentioned what</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.380" end="00:57:29.079" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and what&#39;s happening so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.059" end="00:57:32.529" style="s2">wanted to ask you there&#39;s any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.079" end="00:57:37.329" style="s2">final summative not to bring things to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.529" end="00:57:44.580" style="s2">completion any final summit you want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.329" end="00:57:49.710" style="s2">say no I I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.580" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">that we we try to stay open in in rapid</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.710" end="00:57:57.980" style="s2">change and when we have virus or war</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:58:02.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to to want to shut down</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.980" end="00:58:06.810" style="s2">to go back yes yes shut down go back</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.040" end="00:58:08.370" style="s2">okay but we know that there is no no</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.810" end="00:58:11.550" style="s2">going back there is a lot to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.370" end="00:58:14.630" style="s2">history there is a continuing continued</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.550" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">continuity there is a continuum that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.630" end="00:58:21.000" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we should realize the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:23.010" style="s2">important of our roots and the more well</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.000" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">we know our roots the more rooted we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.010" end="00:58:30.540" style="s2">the more free we are to explore and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:31.380" style="s2">experiment and and to dare those leaps</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.540" end="00:58:34.350" style="s2">of faith</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.380" end="00:58:36.360" style="s2">mostly individually so faith but also</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.350" end="00:58:55.560" style="s2">the collective ones that we are now</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.360" end="00:58:58.320" style="s2">facing the market myth yep it also</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.560" end="00:59:00.870" style="s2">Thomas has some YouTube videos that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.320" end="00:59:03.360" style="s2">out there that maybe Thomas you can send</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.870" end="00:59:05.070" style="s2">me some links for things I can put on</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.360" end="00:59:08.520" style="s2">each of the notes for this video so</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.070" end="00:59:12.410" style="s2">people can get more in contact with with</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.520" end="00:59:15.690" style="s2">your work so I will do that John so</p>
