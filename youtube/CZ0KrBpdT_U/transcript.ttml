<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">project reason for a while I added some</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:21.750" style="s2">things to the agenda I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.910" end="00:00:23.490" style="s2">anyone else did</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.750" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">I also don&#39;t know if I sent up the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.490" end="00:00:37.460" style="s2">agenda in a little other link I just do</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">that there we go</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.460" end="00:00:43.110" style="s2">she got it from Facebook you want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.190" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">look at the agenda and add things to it</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:51.860" style="s2">oh I&#39;d like I&#39;m watching myself talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">about three seconds behind that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.860" end="00:00:56.059" style="s2">there we go I think it&#39;s fine now all</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.059" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">so my brother and I had a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">on the weekend or I think he got the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">vision for the meta project what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">game be like having a space for game be</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">people to come to bring their projects</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:16.229" style="s2">and figure out what meta project we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:17.700" style="s2">to facilitate that without people ever</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.229" end="00:01:19.560" style="s2">having to give up ownership and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">project raising is a big piece of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.560" end="00:01:24.090" style="s2">it&#39;s what we&#39;re already doing we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">our fix for our world Friday which like</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.090" end="00:01:27.869" style="s2">our live board meeting put together tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:29.909" style="s2">and creating the meta stuff but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.869" end="00:01:33.450" style="s2">actually like the schedulers where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.909" end="00:01:34.860" style="s2">trying because that&#39;s is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">that&#39;s simple enough with enough power</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.860" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">that can have a drastic impact in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">game be space and in in a world so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">I have on the schedule is what we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">talking about on the weekend which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:51.630" style="s2">what do we need in place to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">another YouTube channel that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.630" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">together tech that does that piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:02:00.329" style="s2">right has our live board meetings has</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:02.180" style="s2">our project brazing has hopefully even</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.329" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">like mastermind groups which might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.180" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">what this one is or like this is either</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">a mastermind group we&#39;re bringing our</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">projects and moving forward with them or</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">the mentor project one I also kind of oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">a fourth which might be more of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:24.210" style="s2">Cafe which is like a missing imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:27.600" style="s2">conversation like a conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.210" end="00:02:29.310" style="s2">imagining a better world why is the leg</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.600" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">so that I&#39;m gonna turn off my camera and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.310" end="00:02:32.460" style="s2">move to another location so I&#39;m closer</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">to my Wi-Fi if somebody else wants to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.460" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">talk for a moment okay I like all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.800" end="00:02:43.020" style="s2">that where you go and ghibli one quick</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:46.470" style="s2">thing to mention about the scheduling</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.020" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">tool is that someone did mention an area</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.470" end="00:02:50.850" style="s2">where they have something similar that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:54.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t think of is gambling websites</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.850" end="00:02:56.880" style="s2">where you&#39;re playing like cards against</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.300" end="00:02:58.350" style="s2">people so I don&#39;t know that they&#39;ve the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.880" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2">full scheduling thing but they do have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.350" end="00:03:01.320" style="s2">thing to where you can kind of say when</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">you&#39;re available and it groups people</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.320" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">into small groups so I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:07.770" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna check to see if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">help in source versions of that already</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.770" end="00:03:14.070" style="s2">out that we can build on top of rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:17.310" style="s2">than building from scratch probably not</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.070" end="00:03:19.019" style="s2">but it was just an interesting and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.310" end="00:03:20.580" style="s2">maybe to look at for features and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.019" end="00:03:22.110" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been doing for a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.580" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">long time but I thought that was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.110" end="00:03:30.989" style="s2">interesting little Court Mike says could</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:32.760" style="s2">be actually a solution the the vices</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.989" end="00:03:35.510" style="s2">have largely built the Internet as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.760" end="00:03:37.890" style="s2">know it so yes sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.510" end="00:03:39.480" style="s2">so much is known figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.890" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">incorporate pornography and it will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.480" end="00:03:48.630" style="s2">set yeah I&#39;m ready gamifying it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:50.450" style="s2">really that that&#39;s the big three yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.630" end="00:03:52.980" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.450" end="00:03:56.459" style="s2">though you mentioned they also like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.980" end="00:04:00.360" style="s2">YouTube channel are we are we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.459" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">comfortable with the name I&#39;m fine with</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.360" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">together tech but we also discussed</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">several other things I just want to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">where everyone&#39;s at hon if we discuss</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:10.410" style="s2">other thanks what were the other names</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:13.610" style="s2">that were together tech it&#39;s like a name</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.410" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">that explains it and it&#39;s a placeholder</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.610" end="00:04:22.350" style="s2">yeah I guess the only thing is so is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">is it definitely gonna be tech you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.350" end="00:04:26.010" style="s2">we talked about solutions right I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:27.660" style="s2">that the only thing I was thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.010" end="00:04:29.010" style="s2">think it will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.660" end="00:04:30.990" style="s2">I think there&#39;s gonna end up being like</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.010" end="00:04:34.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you want to call it like</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.990" end="00:04:36.480" style="s2">child companies or what that wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.170" end="00:04:38.340" style="s2">necessarily tech but I think like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.480" end="00:04:39.870" style="s2">main thing that the the framework that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.340" end="00:04:41.130" style="s2">dragged all the pieces and touches</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.870" end="00:04:44.580" style="s2">everything I think that will end up</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.130" end="00:04:46.920" style="s2">being tech I think art yeah like our</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.580" end="00:04:48.990" style="s2">tagline is something with solutions in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.920" end="00:04:51.300" style="s2">it like iterative solute iterative</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">solutions we create together it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.300" end="00:04:55.920" style="s2">that but something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">okay that explains it more but together</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.920" end="00:05:00.660" style="s2">Tech is both like we&#39;re creating tech</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">together and everyone can do it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.660" end="00:05:04.980" style="s2">everyone can come be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:08.750" style="s2">like if I&#39;m here to Creighton Tech and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.980" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">you want to come for a tech know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.750" end="00:05:13.230" style="s2">with another name but the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">channel together Tech doesn&#39;t exist yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.230" end="00:05:17.970" style="s2">so we might as well yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:20.060" style="s2">little hard to change a name I think on</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.970" end="00:05:23.160" style="s2">YouTube once you create a channel for it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.060" end="00:05:24.060" style="s2">but it that should be fine I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.160" end="00:05:26.640" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.060" end="00:05:28.200" style="s2">I cannot help in creating that channel</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.640" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">because YouTube put a restriction on me</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.200" end="00:05:33.150" style="s2">because I created too many channels I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:34.890" style="s2">can only do one here I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.150" end="00:05:38.040" style="s2">already created it within three interns</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.890" end="00:05:39.780" style="s2">okay I think when I last cuz I just did</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.040" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">the wiki election one like a couple</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">weeks ago I think it said I could do</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:45.810" style="s2">three a year for my phone number so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:48.480" style="s2">can still technically do it yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.810" end="00:05:50.520" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be the one to do it part</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.480" end="00:05:53.190" style="s2">of the reason I don&#39;t want to be the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:56.250" style="s2">to do it is I&#39;m at the limit with crowd</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.190" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">democracy for my stream yard of 20 hours</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.250" end="00:06:01.260" style="s2">a month and that&#39;s one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:03.750" style="s2">would like to have a new youtube one and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.260" end="00:06:05.669" style="s2">if I was the one creating it and doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.750" end="00:06:07.380" style="s2">that then I would I wouldn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.669" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">sign out and sign in and do that and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.380" end="00:06:12.360" style="s2">feel like you guys should all have that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:13.980" style="s2">more the ability to do that much more</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.360" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">easily than I do but I do think it needs</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.980" end="00:06:18.390" style="s2">to be like a corporate account like it</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:20.640" style="s2">needs to be a productive remember anyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.390" end="00:06:22.440" style="s2">can sign in and anyone could so if no</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.640" end="00:06:23.669" style="s2">one else is available but I could sign</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.440" end="00:06:26.250" style="s2">in and sign out and I&#39;ll figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.669" end="00:06:28.500" style="s2">but then it&#39;s like one name we have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.250" end="00:06:32.070" style="s2">password yeah we&#39;ll have to figure out</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.220" end="00:06:38.910" style="s2">account where it&#39;s our accounts and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.840" end="00:06:41.490" style="s2">we can all go and do it well we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.910" end="00:06:44.520" style="s2">to figure that out for both YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.490" end="00:06:46.620" style="s2">for first community and then what</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.520" end="00:06:49.530" style="s2">exactly I mean I think much like this</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.199" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">groups but before we start it having</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.449" end="00:07:11.910" style="s2">some idea of what the different shows</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.750" end="00:08:43.529" style="s2">until we get somebody involved at once</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.669" end="00:08:45.540" style="s2">to the website can just sort of be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.529" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">placeholder pointing to the channels</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.540" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">that actually have information and I can</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">we&#39;re doing all that like creating a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:08:55.320" style="s2">website stuff like that that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:56.730" style="s2">easy I like just a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.320" end="00:08:58.950" style="s2">it&#39;s just a placeholder and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.730" end="00:09:00.210" style="s2">trying to keep it up to date in theory I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.950" end="00:09:01.770" style="s2">should be updating the wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.210" end="00:09:03.090" style="s2">website I almost never do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.770" end="00:09:07.020" style="s2">actually got some pages and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.090" end="00:09:10.680" style="s2">that but same issue so I volunteer for</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.020" end="00:09:13.020" style="s2">that but just like right now it is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.680" end="00:09:14.970" style="s2">website that someone had put three</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.020" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">months of time into to change from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.970" end="00:09:18.900" style="s2">Wix website to the WordPress website I</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.250" end="00:09:20.610" style="s2">don&#39;t want to hold it like that just</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.900" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">because it is that you already need it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.610" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">some of the time and do it but I also</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:28.170" style="s2">kind of do put up anyway</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:29.910" style="s2">my I mean a landing page that is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.170" end="00:09:31.730" style="s2">and maybe the other things because it at</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.910" end="00:09:35.270" style="s2">least explains the sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.730" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">yeah where is it like is it hosted on</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.270" end="00:09:38.880" style="s2">like the WordPress servers right now is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:42.840" style="s2">that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.880" end="00:09:44.430" style="s2">I believe isn&#39;t WordPress just a a a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.840" end="00:09:46.400" style="s2">framework it do they actually do hosting</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.430" end="00:09:49.170" style="s2">as well I feel like it&#39;s on Bluehost</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.400" end="00:09:51.030" style="s2">well which is a WordPress but I might</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.170" end="00:09:53.070" style="s2">also be wrong like this is where I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.030" end="00:09:55.020" style="s2">techy and I can&#39;t even like get into my</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.070" end="00:09:56.310" style="s2">wordpress account the easiest thing to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.020" end="00:09:57.840" style="s2">do is start with if we&#39;re only doing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.310" end="00:09:59.610" style="s2">single page might just be a Google site</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.840" end="00:10:00.450" style="s2">where it&#39;s like a single page throw it</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.610" end="00:10:04.050" style="s2">online it&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.450" end="00:10:07.260" style="s2">I think we can I think we can recover</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.050" end="00:10:12.420" style="s2">so the together tech org and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.260" end="00:10:13.710" style="s2">could get access to it your read the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.420" end="00:10:15.150" style="s2">name of the person that was helping you</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.710" end="00:10:18.360" style="s2">out but I&#39;m sure if I contact her again</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.150" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">she&#39;d give me a login probably if he can</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.360" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">sit good yeah yeah my issue is like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:23.670" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be the person that log</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.410" end="00:10:27.000" style="s2">because I won&#39;t have to contact her</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.670" end="00:10:31.110" style="s2">every time like the domain name or who</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.709" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">dedicated to this and I think also being</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.829" end="00:12:11.519" style="s2">able to communicate what it is we&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:14.459" style="s2">to in the game be space like being able</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.519" end="00:12:16.739" style="s2">to say like this isn&#39;t for our four</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.459" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">projects right this is for like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.739" end="00:12:21.059" style="s2">is the one thing that got the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:24.389" style="s2">attraction in the game be space so when</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.389" end="00:12:28.290" style="s2">facilitate helping people with their</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.279" end="00:12:31.049" style="s2">projects while creating it at a project</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.290" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">while like something that actually works</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.049" end="00:12:35.970" style="s2">and it&#39;s already giving value right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:39.779" style="s2">I think project raising is that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.970" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">having conversations that people enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.779" end="00:12:45.720" style="s2">being part of is is that but how to have</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.720" end="00:12:51.749" style="s2">a new YouTube channel that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.110" end="00:12:54.629" style="s2">the four of us right like also possibly</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.749" end="00:12:56.970" style="s2">invention like mastermind groups having</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.629" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">a sense making project mastermind group</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.970" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">which is probably this one with - me</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:04.110" style="s2">like you know they&#39;d be like recent</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:05.819" style="s2">score wiki election kind act like having</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.110" end="00:13:09.239" style="s2">the ones that are kind of grouped</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.819" end="00:13:10.350" style="s2">together around a common project which</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.239" end="00:13:12.059" style="s2">is not what you&#39;re supposed to do with</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.350" end="00:13:13.850" style="s2">mastermind groups but I think it is in</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.059" end="00:13:17.309" style="s2">game be what you&#39;re supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.850" end="00:13:19.049" style="s2">absolutely and maybe they don&#39;t food</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.309" end="00:13:22.499" style="s2">ones or whatever it is but having one</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.049" end="00:13:24.209" style="s2">space for if they want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.499" end="00:13:28.819" style="s2">your mastermind group and zoom and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.209" end="00:13:32.489" style="s2">know you can upload it and say this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.819" end="00:13:34.109" style="s2">if you&#39;re a game B mastermind group we</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.489" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">can you know post them all here and link</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.109" end="00:13:37.169" style="s2">them in our playlist if they want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:41.489" style="s2">post them on their own YouTube whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.169" end="00:13:46.709" style="s2">that is to have content that itself is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.489" end="00:13:52.879" style="s2">already the meta project and what that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.709" end="00:13:55.979" style="s2">looks like so um for me YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.879" end="00:14:01.259" style="s2">basically only the final point as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.979" end="00:14:04.559" style="s2">outlet also but before that you so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.259" end="00:14:07.649" style="s2">are going to use stream yard to do the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.559" end="00:14:12.389" style="s2">actual video calls or what are we going</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.649" end="00:14:14.069" style="s2">to do for that stream assume something</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.389" end="00:14:16.229" style="s2">where people can actually then come</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.069" end="00:14:20.189" style="s2">together and then decide whether they</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.229" end="00:14:26.849" style="s2">want to stream it live or just record it</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.189" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">or maybe yeah that&#39;s part of it the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.849" end="00:14:31.289" style="s2">Better Project yeah so the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.519" end="00:14:32.489" style="s2">is the scheduler is like how would like</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.289" end="00:14:34.649" style="s2">if people don&#39;t want to be live on</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.489" end="00:14:35.909" style="s2">YouTube how do you get people into a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.649" end="00:14:38.009" style="s2">mastermind group right what does a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.909" end="00:14:39.929" style="s2">mastermind group look like that ended up</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.009" end="00:14:43.139" style="s2">at selfish conversations to have either</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.929" end="00:14:44.849" style="s2">on zoom or on YouTube but yeah to be on</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.139" end="00:14:46.889" style="s2">YouTube stream yard works fairly well to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.849" end="00:14:48.689" style="s2">street live but not everyone&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.889" end="00:14:51.419" style="s2">want to have it on everyone so like zoom</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.689" end="00:14:53.789" style="s2">records fine and can be uploaded as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.419" end="00:14:55.529" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have the technology to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.789" end="00:14:56.909" style="s2">able to offer to people hey sign up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.529" end="00:14:58.709" style="s2">we&#39;ll give you a mastermind group right</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.909" end="00:15:00.989" style="s2">sign up and match you with the people</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.709" end="00:15:03.169" style="s2">who also are into food that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.989" end="00:15:05.220" style="s2">partly what we&#39;re working through yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.169" end="00:15:07.259" style="s2">how do we do that to the best of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.220" end="00:15:10.289" style="s2">ability with existing technology while</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.259" end="00:15:11.459" style="s2">we&#39;re creating new technology and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.289" end="00:15:13.349" style="s2">getting people to be part of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.459" end="00:15:15.419" style="s2">conversation so they have the energy to</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.349" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">want to create that and hopefully put</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.419" end="00:15:19.439" style="s2">money into it right the four of us</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:20.879" style="s2">creating a scheduler for cost $10,000</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.439" end="00:15:22.139" style="s2">and each one of two thousand five</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.879" end="00:15:23.399" style="s2">hundred others each right if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.139" end="00:15:24.629" style="s2">hundred of us creating that because we</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.399" end="00:15:27.929" style="s2">all have a project that we&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.629" end="00:15:29.509" style="s2">in in previous its and and more so</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.929" end="00:15:34.930" style="s2">actually out of that hundred someone&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.509" end="00:15:39.699" style="s2">amazing it right feel free to do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.930" end="00:15:41.559" style="s2">yeah exactly and some of this I might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.699" end="00:15:43.300" style="s2">able to build a knack the tool that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.559" end="00:15:46.509" style="s2">used for the the wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.300" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">prototypes it&#39;s been pretty good I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.509" end="00:15:51.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not the prettiest thing but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:53.499" style="s2">works in it lets you sort of do what</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.220" end="00:15:59.459" style="s2">needs to get done what tool is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.499" end="00:15:59.459" style="s2">again a true nak kan ack sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.790" end="00:16:04.420" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly it like a build your own</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.769" end="00:16:06.220" style="s2">database you know where there&#39;s tables</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.420" end="00:16:08.019" style="s2">and tables can we buy other tables and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.220" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">then you can you know add records to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.019" end="00:16:13.240" style="s2">little stuff but there&#39;s some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:14.559" style="s2">sort of automation and yeah yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.240" end="00:16:16.540" style="s2">also suggest now I haven&#39;t played with</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.559" end="00:16:19.420" style="s2">it yet but check out that bubble dot IO</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.540" end="00:16:24.749" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s a similar tool if you hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.420" end="00:16:28.990" style="s2">already checked it out yet but bubbler</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.749" end="00:16:31.300" style="s2">bubble dot IO maybe ble we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.990" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">about record for you know in my life oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.300" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.269" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s a that&#39;s a way to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.689" end="00:16:42.519" style="s2">complicated apps that&#39;s mostly drag you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">drop you know code right okay and even</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.519" end="00:16:47.019" style="s2">though I&#39;m a software developer for 20</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:48.370" style="s2">years I&#39;d prefer to do that then write</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.019" end="00:16:50.110" style="s2">everything from scratch at least when</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.370" end="00:16:52.689" style="s2">you&#39;re experimenting so fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.110" end="00:16:54.639" style="s2">I haven&#39;t played with it enough yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.689" end="00:16:56.559" style="s2">though I&#39;m just yeah I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.639" end="00:16:58.779" style="s2">couple of those apps out there I saw a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.559" end="00:17:01.480" style="s2">few it sounds sort of like a nagger o.o</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.779" end="00:17:05.010" style="s2">probably alternatives to each other so</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.480" end="00:17:08.380" style="s2">be clear which one is can you still</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.010" end="00:17:10.120" style="s2">access the code of bubble that I oh I</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.380" end="00:17:13.720" style="s2">haven&#39;t looked at it yet</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.120" end="00:17:17.289" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna have to see the reusability</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.720" end="00:17:23.230" style="s2">and what happens when you hit their</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.289" end="00:17:26.289" style="s2">walls I did look at dang it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.230" end="00:17:31.179" style="s2">another one out there web flow and web</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.289" end="00:17:32.649" style="s2">flow looks pretty darn limited some</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.179" end="00:17:34.179" style="s2">humpin bubble would be better so in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.649" end="00:17:37.929" style="s2">button a couple weeks I should I should</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.179" end="00:17:42.130" style="s2">have a good idea of what it takes to if</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.929" end="00:17:43.630" style="s2">it&#39;s really do like a member portal with</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.130" end="00:17:45.399" style="s2">it you cannot give you any logins and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.630" end="00:17:46.510" style="s2">people can poke vehicle yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.399" end="00:17:48.460" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that it comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.510" end="00:17:52.030" style="s2">built with the web flow doesn&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.460" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">interactivity like web flow has forms</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.030" end="00:17:57.640" style="s2">but you can&#39;t do anything with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:18:00.370" style="s2">bubble seems to have forms and interact</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.640" end="00:18:03.670" style="s2">and workflows in the backend for some</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.370" end="00:18:05.500" style="s2">automation and stuff but I haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.670" end="00:18:09.550" style="s2">what your what&#39;s your neck does I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.500" end="00:18:11.950" style="s2">do it sounds similar to bubble I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.550" end="00:18:17.590" style="s2">probably check that out and see how it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.950" end="00:18:18.970" style="s2">compares and no it sounds promising</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.590" end="00:18:22.200" style="s2">anything that can help us kind of build</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.970" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">a basic scheduler as well as a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.200" end="00:18:29.110" style="s2">like Heather keeps sending me now</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:31.720" style="s2">amazing projects that are possibly</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.110" end="00:18:33.040" style="s2">savings we can use but there&#39;s too many</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.720" end="00:18:34.150" style="s2">like I&#39;m like I can&#39;t keep anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.040" end="00:18:36.760" style="s2">straight I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.150" end="00:18:38.290" style="s2">and that&#39;s well to be able to do that to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.760" end="00:18:40.690" style="s2">be able to know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.290" end="00:18:41.440" style="s2">it gave me a not like what projects and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.690" end="00:18:42.970" style="s2">where they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.440" end="00:18:45.340" style="s2">cuz a lot of them sound cool but they</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.970" end="00:18:46.510" style="s2">don&#39;t exist yet and then some exist but</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.340" end="00:18:47.680" style="s2">they&#39;re you know what I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.510" end="00:18:49.300" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of selling you their vision</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.680" end="00:18:50.530" style="s2">in the future when they&#39;re beta isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.300" end="00:18:53.020" style="s2">the greatest and then some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.530" end="00:18:57.670" style="s2">amazing right now and it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.020" end="00:18:59.350" style="s2">ones do we use and for any project right</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.670" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">not for necessarily for the four</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.350" end="00:19:02.590" style="s2">together tech the meta project but like</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:04.420" style="s2">which one does wiki like shabus if they</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.590" end="00:19:07.090" style="s2">want to and you know figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.420" end="00:19:09.610" style="s2">that process looks like as we figure out</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.090" end="00:19:11.470" style="s2">what we would need in our figure well</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.610" end="00:19:13.750" style="s2">that might be an interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.470" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">almost like create a catalog of all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.750" end="00:19:17.050" style="s2">different apps that we sort of been</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:18.940" style="s2">looking at save which ones we actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.050" end="00:19:21.340" style="s2">use but also which ones we looked at and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.940" end="00:19:30.910" style="s2">decided like no not that one for these</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.340" end="00:19:32.470" style="s2">reasons so no I saw the in the game B</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.910" end="00:19:33.790" style="s2">group I saw the wiki that&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.470" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">started where they have like all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.790" end="00:19:38.560" style="s2">projects but I find that like just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">list like that is harder to work with</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.560" end="00:19:41.560" style="s2">because I want to know like aspects</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:42.730" style="s2">about it right like who&#39;s the person</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.530" end="00:20:14.050" style="s2">reason score sense-making thing but</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:16.360" style="s2">there&#39;s other parts too where if</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.050" end="00:20:18.910" style="s2">somebody starts like a news aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.360" end="00:20:20.680" style="s2">tool it would also kind of be that so</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.910" end="00:20:22.330" style="s2">you might sort of end up being in these</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.680" end="00:20:24.580" style="s2">different parts of things that you touch</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.330" end="00:20:27.150" style="s2">to help talk about people who are also</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:54.670" style="s2">things right but we don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.300" end="00:20:56.650" style="s2">people necessarily quite yet like there</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.670" end="00:20:58.150" style="s2">if we had hundreds of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.650" end="00:20:59.320" style="s2">like poking out a project that would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.150" end="00:21:00.460" style="s2">the one we&#39;d saw but instead of you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.320" end="00:21:05.020" style="s2">hundreds of people were like I have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.460" end="00:21:08.920" style="s2">project give me people but so was that</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.250" end="00:21:26.920" style="s2">has a lot I think of potential for game</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.620" end="00:21:28.630" style="s2">be like having an on-demand printing you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.920" end="00:21:30.460" style="s2">know what I mean like basically 3d</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.840" end="00:21:38.980" style="s2">the game B space if you&#39;re a funding</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.550" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">expert come participate in this but for</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.980" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">future having like expert panels right</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">that are like hey send it up to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:47.080" style="s2">financial people that&#39;s who I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:50.800" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna want finance but also</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.080" end="00:21:52.780" style="s2">like a metric of like are you ready for</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.800" end="00:21:54.040" style="s2">financing he really is like he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.780" end="00:21:55.690" style="s2">getting it and doing that right like</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.040" end="00:21:58.090" style="s2">you&#39;re like it&#39;d be great if together</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.690" end="00:21:59.320" style="s2">tech get financing what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.090" end="00:22:01.480" style="s2">with it we don&#39;t even bank account</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.320" end="00:22:05.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t deal with that right like to</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.480" end="00:22:09.850" style="s2">know when you&#39;re capable of asking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.770" end="00:22:11.410" style="s2">that expert panel as well as asking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.850" end="00:22:12.370" style="s2">it like maybe you don&#39;t need that right</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.410" end="00:22:14.020" style="s2">maybe it is just the four of us</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.370" end="00:22:16.090" style="s2">brainstorming ways he could make money</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.020" end="00:22:17.529" style="s2">as opposed to knowing how to get grant</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.090" end="00:22:20.590" style="s2">knowing how to do crowdfunding and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.529" end="00:22:24.220" style="s2">knowing how to having angel investors</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.590" end="00:22:26.020" style="s2">right like what is the but having a list</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.220" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">of people and their expertise is what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.020" end="00:22:30.669" style="s2">was going for totally good who want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:32.140" style="s2">be reached out for for that right</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.669" end="00:22:34.870" style="s2">because if there&#39;s ten people or finance</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.140" end="00:22:36.250" style="s2">and you like hey cube spawn that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.870" end="00:22:38.200" style="s2">gonna resonate with some people and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.250" end="00:22:39.429" style="s2">with others and so those are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.200" end="00:22:44.380" style="s2">who are gonna come and of course based</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.429" end="00:22:49.210" style="s2">on their schedule so for that scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.380" end="00:22:52.330" style="s2">um what kind of information do we only</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.210" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">to collect in what kind of parts are in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.330" end="00:22:58.539" style="s2">my mind um we definitely we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:01.059" style="s2">that a scheduler like where where people</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.539" end="00:23:05.740" style="s2">can agree on a certain time we need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.059" end="00:23:09.549" style="s2">have different topics about what they</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.740" end="00:23:14.770" style="s2">want to participate in a mastermind or</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.549" end="00:23:20.549" style="s2">project racing or whatever and we need</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.770" end="00:23:24.690" style="s2">to have the database of people with tags</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.549" end="00:23:28.899" style="s2">of their individual expertise</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.690" end="00:23:33.429" style="s2">potentially so whether someone is expert</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.899" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">in I wasn&#39;t necessarily saying they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.429" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">one tool but yeah that I mean that would</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:40.659" style="s2">be awesome if it was a jeweler is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">getting people to conversations right</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.659" end="00:23:44.649" style="s2">which could be a mastermind group that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">meets every week in which case we need</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.649" end="00:23:50.490" style="s2">them based on their topic and expertise</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:52.990" style="s2">or their project one but it&#39;s like as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.490" end="00:23:54.700" style="s2">individual I want a dashboard of all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.990" end="00:23:56.529" style="s2">projects that I&#39;m part of and I want my</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.700" end="00:23:58.120" style="s2">schedule to make sense right so I want</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.529" end="00:24:01.510" style="s2">to I know when I&#39;m free and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.120" end="00:24:03.730" style="s2">find people to talk to on that um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.510" end="00:24:06.760" style="s2">also very much about doing what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.730" end="00:24:08.649" style="s2">doing in a decentralized way so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.760" end="00:24:10.299" style="s2">it&#39;s not broadcast right it&#39;s not we</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.649" end="00:24:11.980" style="s2">have a board meeting of a million people</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.299" end="00:24:13.480" style="s2">watch it it&#39;s a million people have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.980" end="00:24:16.690" style="s2">conversation and how do we have anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.480" end="00:24:18.429" style="s2">come out of that it&#39;s the like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.690" end="00:24:21.370" style="s2">scheduler is how do you get people to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.429" end="00:24:23.950" style="s2">conversation that and of itself is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.370" end="00:24:25.390" style="s2">powerful and then yes if we&#39;re if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.950" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">were creating the schedule for project</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.390" end="00:24:30.070" style="s2">raising in general having a database of</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">your expertise is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.070" end="00:24:32.560" style="s2">part of that but I think it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">naturally arise for the next iteration</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.560" end="00:24:36.220" style="s2">of these people are having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:37.630" style="s2">hey I had a conversation with someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.220" end="00:24:40.620" style="s2">and they were a financial expert I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.630" end="00:24:46.120" style="s2">put you two in contact with each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.620" end="00:24:48.280" style="s2">right which I guess the main point of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.120" end="00:24:50.110" style="s2">all this is you have to get people</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.280" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">basically interested and get people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.110" end="00:24:57.280" style="s2">participate what do we actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:25:03.130" style="s2">get people to participate what makes</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.280" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">them come so I&#39;m just brainstorming here</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.130" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">but for me one of the things is to see</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:14.530" style="s2">what is available to see who they could</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">potentially connect with to have this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.530" end="00:25:20.140" style="s2">platform where they can put out promote</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:23.920" style="s2">their own thing maybe or so these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.140" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">some things that if they can do that on</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.920" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">our schedule or platform then that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:33.370" style="s2">already some incentive to come what else</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:40.570" style="s2">would be out there that we could I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.370" end="00:25:43.300" style="s2">just trying to a yeah of this and of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.570" end="00:25:45.220" style="s2">course we can then iterate in what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.300" end="00:25:47.890" style="s2">want to provide in the first place and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.220" end="00:25:50.140" style="s2">then I think that&#39;s really the question</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.890" end="00:25:52.540" style="s2">of the meta project itself is what do</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.140" end="00:25:54.550" style="s2">project like projects like ours it</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.540" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">earlier or later in the stage or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.550" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">same what would interest us what would</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:00.820" style="s2">bring us on board start doing this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.440" style="s2">that interests us first that will in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.820" end="00:26:05.170" style="s2">theory interest some other people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.440" end="00:26:07.060" style="s2">are sort of like-minded they join on and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.170" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">as that expands we start doing more and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.060" end="00:26:10.720" style="s2">born and figuring that stuff out so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:14.920" style="s2">think it&#39;s just we just start doing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">for us we do it publicly and then adjust</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.920" end="00:26:19.810" style="s2">on the fly as we need things and adds</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:22.180" style="s2">people that join on need new things we</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.810" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">start figuring that that out and like</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.180" end="00:26:28.030" style="s2">for the scheduler I&#39;m sort of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:29.860" style="s2">you know phase one isn&#39;t great right</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.030" end="00:26:31.540" style="s2">it&#39;s just people can sort of even just</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.860" end="00:26:33.190" style="s2">type out like I&#39;m available on weekends</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.540" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">and this and that and here&#39;s my time</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.190" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">zone availability yeah and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:39.960" style="s2">there&#39;s like maybe just a wall of here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:41.890" style="s2">this person here&#39;s the times they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.960" end="00:26:43.690" style="s2">available here&#39;s the stuff they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.890" end="00:26:43.900" style="s2">interested in it&#39;s actually people going</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.690" end="00:26:45.850" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.900" end="00:26:47.380" style="s2">sort of seeing the data be like oh I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.850" end="00:26:50.140" style="s2">me at that time we have similar stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.380" end="00:26:52.420" style="s2">cool let&#39;s go up to the side and talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.140" end="00:26:54.610" style="s2">about how we actually set it up say okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.420" end="00:26:58.360" style="s2">I have that now created I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.610" end="00:27:01.690" style="s2">that conversation anymore it&#39;ll be kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.360" end="00:27:05.020" style="s2">of heavy and not very intuitive and sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.690" end="00:27:07.710" style="s2">of more grunt work involved in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.020" end="00:27:10.120" style="s2">figure out what whoo-hoo-hoo meets when</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.710" end="00:27:13.540" style="s2">but then once we get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.120" end="00:27:15.250" style="s2">that&#39;s too cumbersome we&#39;ve got a decent</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.540" end="00:27:17.380" style="s2">sized community and we can start saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.250" end="00:27:19.300" style="s2">hey what&#39;s our parity is it to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.380" end="00:27:22.510" style="s2">scheduler great everybody caught up up</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.300" end="00:27:25.090" style="s2">ten bucks and then or you know however</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.510" end="00:27:27.160" style="s2">it ends up happening but then we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.090" end="00:27:28.600" style="s2">actually start to build it out if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.160" end="00:27:30.910" style="s2">scheduler is kind of working fine</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.600" end="00:27:32.380" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s it&#39;s clunky but</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.910" end="00:27:34.270" style="s2">you just set up your two or three groups</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.380" end="00:27:38.920" style="s2">and then you don&#39;t need it anymore that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.270" end="00:27:41.980" style="s2">might last for a while if that made</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.920" end="00:27:44.050" style="s2">sense yeah it kind of it because I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.980" end="00:27:47.260" style="s2">expecting the scheduler that the beta</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.050" end="00:27:49.030" style="s2">iteration to do a lot of that work to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.260" end="00:27:52.120" style="s2">the connecting people but maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.030" end="00:27:54.250" style="s2">maybe it is just your schedule and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.120" end="00:27:56.020" style="s2">somebody else is like hey you both like</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.250" end="00:27:58.270" style="s2">to talk about farming we&#39;ve set you up a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.020" end="00:28:01.570" style="s2">farm in one rusty you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.270" end="00:28:03.460" style="s2">topic people like it needs to be time</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.570" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">and space that you can meet anatomic</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.460" end="00:28:08.230" style="s2">yeah and if it can match you based on</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:10.390" style="s2">that then okay I think we had like in</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.230" end="00:28:12.220" style="s2">knack or bubble or wish it for at I we</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.390" end="00:28:13.480" style="s2">have a list of all the people and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.220" end="00:28:15.880" style="s2">we can do like you know what was</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.480" end="00:28:17.980" style="s2">interested in what your talents are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.880" end="00:28:20.170" style="s2">know when you when you as a person are</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.980" end="00:28:24.040" style="s2">available and then a separate list of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.170" end="00:28:25.570" style="s2">the projects where like what categories</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.040" end="00:28:27.010" style="s2">do they pull into who&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.570" end="00:28:29.320" style="s2">involved in that project what help do</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.010" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">they need and then you can start to add</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.320" end="00:28:33.730" style="s2">on more be like okay well for the people</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:35.350" style="s2">what are they interested in what do they</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.730" end="00:28:38.290" style="s2">want to meet on and then start to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.350" end="00:28:40.150" style="s2">where people have similar interests and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.290" end="00:28:42.280" style="s2">availabilities and then okay you three</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.150" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">overlap you have this you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.280" end="00:28:45.970" style="s2">all working on sense-making and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:48.250" style="s2">all said that you&#39;re available you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.970" end="00:28:51.880" style="s2">around the same time on Sunday is cool</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.250" end="00:28:53.680" style="s2">we can start to meet up we log that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.880" end="00:28:56.260" style="s2">we&#39;re no longer looking for sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.680" end="00:28:57.490" style="s2">groups because we found one and we&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.260" end="00:29:01.390" style="s2">longer available at that time</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.490" end="00:29:05.380" style="s2">on Sundays and then that&#39;s you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.390" end="00:29:06.940" style="s2">think fairly hard to use to start with</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.380" end="00:29:08.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s just the like tracking the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.940" end="00:29:13.270" style="s2">people in the projects and that it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.920" end="00:29:14.950" style="s2">be super easy to use but the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:18.550" style="s2">that once it starts to become a problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.950" end="00:29:19.540" style="s2">we can start as a community to say when</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.550" end="00:29:21.490" style="s2">do we need to fix this</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.540" end="00:29:24.700" style="s2">when is this becoming too hard to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.490" end="00:29:27.240" style="s2">too hard to maintain when do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.700" end="00:29:29.620" style="s2">actually you know start to work together</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.240" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">to actually build something that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.620" end="00:29:36.040" style="s2">just popsicle sticks and glue yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">showcasing that it&#39;s popsicle stick</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.040" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">singl ooh there&#39;s someone behind the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:41.140" style="s2">scenes figuring this out and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:44.620" style="s2">piece that&#39;s not working because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.140" end="00:29:46.590" style="s2">like X amount of hours and paying them</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.620" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">for it possibly so are at least</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.590" end="00:29:51.190" style="s2">assigning a currency value to it so like</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:53.050" style="s2">hey look we&#39;ve spending five hundred</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.190" end="00:29:55.210" style="s2">dollars a week doing this we can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.050" end="00:29:56.800" style="s2">spending five hundred dollars a year</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.210" end="00:30:00.400" style="s2">creating that technology I keep it in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.800" end="00:30:03.070" style="s2">place but for me like although the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.400" end="00:30:05.260" style="s2">projects is what is bringing people in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.070" end="00:30:06.850" style="s2">like the project raising and together</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.260" end="00:30:08.350" style="s2">tech of like what can we create that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.850" end="00:30:12.190" style="s2">gonna facilitate your project</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.350" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">the scheduler itself kinda has to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.190" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">designed for the individual working on</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:20.500" style="s2">the project as opposed to the project</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:21.880" style="s2">but both like an individual if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.500" end="00:30:23.110" style="s2">help wiki elections I want to know when</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.880" end="00:30:24.220" style="s2">they&#39;re speaking and I want to become</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.110" end="00:30:26.770" style="s2">and watch or be part of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.220" end="00:30:29.559" style="s2">conversations more so I want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.770" end="00:30:30.340" style="s2">to know which conversations I&#39;m a part</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.559" end="00:30:33.429" style="s2">of them what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.340" end="00:30:35.110" style="s2">this might actively becomes the really</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.429" end="00:30:38.200" style="s2">early version of the talent exchange</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.110" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">that we were talking about and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.200" end="00:30:41.800" style="s2">be both you have to be able to see as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:44.950" style="s2">project here&#39;s what I I need help with</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.800" end="00:30:46.540" style="s2">and as as talent you can go to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.950" end="00:30:48.910" style="s2">exchange and say here&#39;s all the projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.540" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">that need you know like I I guess STL I</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.910" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">would say here&#39;s what my talents are</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:54.370" style="s2">they can say here&#39;s all the projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.470" style="s2">that need that kind of help go search</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.370" end="00:30:59.250" style="s2">through them and see what you like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.470" end="00:31:03.040" style="s2">and then schedule a news conference at</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.250" end="00:31:05.140" style="s2">with that person but I I&#39;m also talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.040" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">more people without a project or a</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.140" end="00:31:08.830" style="s2">talent who are just like yes I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">come and raise somebody&#39;s project right</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.830" end="00:31:10.600" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna come in brainstorm I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:14.350" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.600" end="00:31:16.029" style="s2">and work what can I do with wiki lection</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.350" end="00:31:17.320" style="s2">because there&#39;s this big and maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.029" end="00:31:18.700" style="s2">not solving that problem yet even though</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.320" end="00:31:21.850" style="s2">it&#39;s the problem I really want to solve</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.700" end="00:31:23.080" style="s2">is people don&#39;t know where they fit and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.850" end="00:31:25.480" style="s2">they don&#39;t know that they even are</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.080" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">valuable and so being able to give them</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.480" end="00:31:29.019" style="s2">the opportunity to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:31.269" style="s2">conversation like the Omega roll</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.019" end="00:31:33.460" style="s2">conversation which is what Eric the one</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.269" end="00:31:35.080" style="s2">on Tuesday is becoming it&#39;s the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.460" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna grow as big as it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.080" end="00:31:38.259" style="s2">grow up to 100 people and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:40.029" style="s2">break them off into zoom conversations</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.259" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">so that&#39;s one of the reasons he invited</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.029" end="00:31:43.750" style="s2">me as he knows that&#39;s what I&#39;m focusing</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:46.179" style="s2">on it&#39;s like how do we have a conference</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.750" end="00:31:47.080" style="s2">how do we do that conversation and like</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.179" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">oh yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.080" end="00:31:51.879" style="s2">so just make a rule I think then what</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:54.250" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of talking about is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.879" end="00:31:56.139" style="s2">gonna have almost like a pipeline for</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.250" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">projects or like you know flow you start</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.139" end="00:31:59.259" style="s2">off here you go through here you go</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:32:00.820" style="s2">through these stages and a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.259" end="00:32:02.379" style="s2">meta project is creating sort of a</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.379" end="00:32:08.909" style="s2">you move through it how&#39;s that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.149" end="00:32:10.750" style="s2">also talking about sort of like a talent</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.909" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">building pipeline or telling</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.299" end="00:32:37.090" style="s2">the meta project is arranged is if let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.539" end="00:32:38.379" style="s2">say you&#39;ve got like a funding</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.950" end="00:33:04.840" style="s2">there where those sessions aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:06.070" style="s2">meant for expert talking to project</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.840" end="00:33:07.750" style="s2">leader it&#39;s also meant to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.070" end="00:33:11.950" style="s2">identify and build that skillset</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.750" end="00:33:13.299" style="s2">indicate in the community so those those</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.950" end="00:33:15.309" style="s2">meetings become at least three different</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.299" end="00:33:17.379" style="s2">types like three types of people your</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.309" end="00:33:19.659" style="s2">expert your project person and then</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.659" end="00:33:24.250" style="s2">sort of get get a grasp on that space</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.940" end="00:33:26.770" style="s2">and that becomes their pipeline of used</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.250" end="00:33:28.870" style="s2">here you start at the spot everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.770" end="00:33:30.700" style="s2">that talent and then we build a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.870" end="00:33:32.500" style="s2">framework for you know how you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.700" end="00:33:36.730" style="s2">explore and start to identify where your</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.500" end="00:33:40.450" style="s2">strengths are and what you enjoy I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.730" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s all like it&#39;s as an</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.450" end="00:33:44.470" style="s2">individual I&#39;m coming in without needing</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:47.770" style="s2">to get anywhere go anywhere know my</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.470" end="00:33:49.570" style="s2">strengths or talents it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.570" end="00:33:53.170" style="s2">I&#39;m not on Twitter to figure out my per</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.220" end="00:33:54.820" style="s2">but also yeah we can figure out your</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.170" end="00:33:57.010" style="s2">purpose and help guide you towards that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.820" end="00:33:59.020" style="s2">if that&#39;s meaningful to you if you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.010" end="00:34:01.000" style="s2">to be part of these conversations we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.020" end="00:34:03.310" style="s2">starting from a place of meta project</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.000" end="00:34:04.600" style="s2">because that&#39;s the one that got game you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.310" end="00:34:05.830" style="s2">know like people have projects they</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.600" end="00:34:08.590" style="s2">don&#39;t want to let their project go and a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.830" end="00:34:10.330" style="s2">company part of something meta and nor</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.590" end="00:34:12.280" style="s2">should they have to but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.330" end="00:34:13.810" style="s2">necessarily designing a pipeline that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.280" end="00:34:15.970" style="s2">like you get to keep your project and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.810" end="00:34:17.620" style="s2">create you know like its how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.970" end="00:34:19.720" style="s2">create a scheduling tool so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.620" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">your idea is you can have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.720" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">around it right you can from the like</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:26.919" style="s2">spark of an idea to you know what if</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:28.899" style="s2">there were dozens of people having</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.919" end="00:34:30.700" style="s2">little mastermind groups about wiki</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.899" end="00:34:33.129" style="s2">election right you mean that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.700" end="00:34:35.590" style="s2">even a part of right just like hey what</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.129" end="00:34:38.950" style="s2">would we want in AI in a you know like</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.590" end="00:34:43.030" style="s2">how to decentralize decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.950" end="00:34:45.310" style="s2">right how to obey sound ever really yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.030" end="00:34:46.929" style="s2">my plan is sort of how to get there</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.310" end="00:34:49.780" style="s2">because you need to have a library of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.929" end="00:34:51.010" style="s2">people first and your point of it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.780" end="00:34:52.810" style="s2">to sort like people don&#39;t always know</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.010" end="00:34:55.240" style="s2">where they fit and people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.810" end="00:34:57.730" style="s2">what they don&#39;t know yeah it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:34:58.840" style="s2">well as a part of the meta project one</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.730" end="00:35:00.340" style="s2">of the main things that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.840" end="00:35:02.860" style="s2">is giving you know these types of</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.340" end="00:35:04.720" style="s2">projects a framework of okay here&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.860" end="00:35:06.490" style="s2">of why you should join but you can just</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:08.260" style="s2">see that by watching us talk about our</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.490" end="00:35:10.120" style="s2">projects watching the framework unfold</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.260" end="00:35:12.070" style="s2">and saying this not a project what does</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.120" end="00:35:14.020" style="s2">it look like what sort of you know like</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.070" end="00:35:15.870" style="s2">the project raising what are the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.020" end="00:35:18.760" style="s2">stages what sort of things can it offer</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.870" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">that it sounds like we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.760" end="00:35:22.780" style="s2">heading in the direction of providing</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">that use to project owners I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.780" end="00:35:26.920" style="s2">to talk about what that looks like and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.460" end="00:35:30.010" style="s2">how you know the any sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.920" end="00:35:33.510" style="s2">alliance of people with with similar</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.510" end="00:35:38.170" style="s2">giving them something similar where you</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.490" end="00:35:40.450" style="s2">know even as a project owner if</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.170" end="00:35:42.299" style="s2">you want like if you&#39;re really good at</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.450" end="00:35:44.710" style="s2">marketing or really good at programming</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.299" end="00:35:46.420" style="s2">you&#39;re like well I like my project but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.710" end="00:35:48.760" style="s2">can also work on other projects as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.420" end="00:35:51.819" style="s2">because you know I&#39;m only especially if</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.760" end="00:35:53.260" style="s2">in exchange I can I can find somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.819" end="00:35:55.059" style="s2">who&#39;s you know if I&#39;m a coder and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.260" end="00:35:58.440" style="s2">somebody else is awesome at marketing if</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.950" end="00:36:08.710" style="s2">to do this or you can do it in one tenth</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.839" end="00:36:12.460" style="s2">the time and I can do that one time I</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.710" end="00:36:14.349" style="s2">view let&#39;s use our time wisely but then</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.460" end="00:36:17.859" style="s2">to actually start to build that pipeline</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.349" end="00:36:19.630" style="s2">of people who can do that work right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.859" end="00:36:22.210" style="s2">start to say hey even if you aren&#39;t sure</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.619" end="00:36:30.520" style="s2">building our framework for what projects</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.780" end="00:36:32.710" style="s2">could go through to get where they want</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.520" end="00:36:35.260" style="s2">to be we have a separate pipeline for</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.710" end="00:36:38.410" style="s2">people to provide you know some talent</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.260" end="00:36:39.910" style="s2">to two projects where the goal is if you</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.950" end="00:36:56.290" style="s2">fit start here and have a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.319" end="00:36:58.359" style="s2">identifying talent and identifying your</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.290" end="00:37:00.579" style="s2">interests and you know structured in a</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.910" end="00:37:07.180" style="s2">any of these or at the very least here</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.950" end="00:37:10.210" style="s2">are the talents that you&#39;ve indicated</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.180" end="00:37:12.150" style="s2">and I mean it&#39;s cataloging people and</p>

<p begin="00:37:12.150" end="00:37:16.390" style="s2">facilitating that back-end so that if</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.440" end="00:37:18.369" style="s2">you have an idea you can find people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.390" end="00:37:20.049" style="s2">have who want to work on that with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.369" end="00:37:22.630" style="s2">or if you have a talent to find where</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.650" end="00:37:32.950" style="s2">could move a project forward not</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.720" end="00:37:34.599" style="s2">everyone has the same talents but</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.950" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">everyone is gonna have at least one like</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.079" end="00:37:49.059" style="s2">every project needs and whether or not</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.550" end="00:38:05.830" style="s2">do better than we&#39;re currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.780" end="00:38:09.070" style="s2">because we&#39;re not really doing much</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.830" end="00:38:11.110" style="s2">right but once you get to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.070" end="00:38:12.850" style="s2">level then you want a marketing team and</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.530" end="00:38:24.010" style="s2">think people do want to help and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:25.780" style="s2">don&#39;t feel capacity to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.010" end="00:38:27.220" style="s2">that and if it&#39;s super simple for them</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.780" end="00:38:29.410" style="s2">to be able to do it just being part of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.220" end="00:38:30.550" style="s2">conversation have any conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.410" end="00:38:32.350" style="s2">figuring out what your talents are</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.550" end="00:38:34.030" style="s2">having you know you want to take</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.350" end="00:38:35.710" style="s2">accounting you know like this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.030" end="00:38:37.210" style="s2">actually a need that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.710" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">have and your mind seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.210" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">that can take that on do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:44.620" style="s2">quit within it but I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:46.510" style="s2">something that naturally arises from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.620" end="00:38:49.870" style="s2">scheduler like something that once you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.510" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">have people with projects hey I need</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.870" end="00:38:53.320" style="s2">marketing who knows marketing right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:55.120" style="s2">then like okay we&#39;ve all talked to Jim</p>

<p begin="00:38:55.120" end="00:39:01.050" style="s2">that down in like a more concrete way so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.250" end="00:39:03.250" style="s2">that it&#39;s easier to find Jim and Jim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.050" end="00:39:05.380" style="s2">yeah but I think as soon as we start</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.250" end="00:39:07.930" style="s2">working on like talent and their needs</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.380" end="00:39:10.680" style="s2">that&#39;s going beyond the need of what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.930" end="00:39:13.690" style="s2">picture when I hear the word scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.680" end="00:39:16.570" style="s2">I just think here&#39;s times I&#39;m available</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.690" end="00:39:18.910" style="s2">here&#39;s time you&#39;re available we want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.570" end="00:39:21.220" style="s2">meet up - a time that works there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.910" end="00:39:22.510" style="s2">layer on top that I think is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.220" end="00:39:24.610" style="s2">talking about where it&#39;s like okay that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.510" end="00:39:27.820" style="s2">project has identified that they need</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.610" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">these three these three talents who has</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.820" end="00:39:32.680" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s sort of how it picks who</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:33.730" style="s2">needs to be involved and that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.680" end="00:39:34.690" style="s2">can be sort of complex and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.730" end="00:39:37.300" style="s2">there&#39;s three people who could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.690" end="00:39:39.310" style="s2">involved her marketing let&#39;s look at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.300" end="00:39:41.410" style="s2">of their availability Oh only one</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.310" end="00:39:43.900" style="s2">matches all right well then we we found</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.410" end="00:39:45.670" style="s2">their match yeah if you need to meet at</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.900" end="00:39:47.530" style="s2">the same time and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.670" end="00:39:49.210" style="s2">scheduler maybe doesn&#39;t like for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.530" end="00:39:50.980" style="s2">project wait for a wiki elections you</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.210" end="00:39:52.540" style="s2">need to meet at the same time to meet</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.980" end="00:39:55.120" style="s2">for together tech we probably want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.540" end="00:39:57.370" style="s2">figure out how to have people not have</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.120" end="00:39:59.460" style="s2">to be made at 11 o&#39;clock on Friday right</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.370" end="00:40:01.600" style="s2">be involved in it because we want their</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.460" end="00:40:02.980" style="s2">expertise we want you know I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.600" end="00:40:05.600" style="s2">want to know what would work for your</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.980" end="00:40:09.740" style="s2">project so that they&#39;re wanting to help</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.600" end="00:40:14.930" style="s2">with an or us but the scheduler itself I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.740" end="00:40:16.670" style="s2">think we maybe want to pick three types</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.930" end="00:40:20.810" style="s2">of a conversation right a mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.670" end="00:40:23.720" style="s2">group a project raising a Omega rule</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.810" end="00:40:25.700" style="s2">group right and design it to do to just</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.720" end="00:40:27.590" style="s2">the scheduling right for those three</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.700" end="00:40:29.090" style="s2">things and then people would want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.590" end="00:40:30.500" style="s2">sign up to say hey I&#39;m I want a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.090" end="00:40:31.850" style="s2">mastermind group right we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.500" end="00:40:33.140" style="s2">do anything else like I want to find</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.850" end="00:40:34.970" style="s2">other people in the game be space to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.140" end="00:40:36.740" style="s2">practice the Omega roll with and so then</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.970" end="00:40:38.030" style="s2">you have and then when people here we</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.740" end="00:40:39.980" style="s2">have this and they have a project</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.030" end="00:40:41.960" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna bring people on board but</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.980" end="00:40:43.700" style="s2">they&#39;re also an anyone this brought on</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.960" end="00:40:45.800" style="s2">board is brought on board for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.700" end="00:40:47.830" style="s2">right which is what a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.800" end="00:40:52.610" style="s2">out there doesn&#39;t do like you can pay</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.830" end="00:40:55.220" style="s2">for media sorry you can pay for tech</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.610" end="00:40:57.020" style="s2">that helps you coordinate a team but</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.220" end="00:40:58.310" style="s2">then you&#39;re paying per team member but</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.020" end="00:40:59.720" style="s2">the team member doesn&#39;t have a dashboard</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.310" end="00:41:02.630" style="s2">where they can be involved in many</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.720" end="00:41:05.150" style="s2">different projects and it&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.630" end="00:41:06.530" style="s2">we like people are bringing people right</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.150" end="00:41:07.940" style="s2">they&#39;re already bringing their</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.530" end="00:41:09.770" style="s2">connections they&#39;re already bringing</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.940" end="00:41:11.660" style="s2">that worth and as long as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.770" end="00:41:13.340" style="s2">something there for them and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.660" end="00:41:17.030" style="s2">where I think there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.340" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">for them being more individual and less</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.030" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">project where anyone who doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:22.460" style="s2">project those are the people we actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:24.710" style="s2">want cuz they&#39;re the ones who are going</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.460" end="00:41:27.110" style="s2">to be giving their ideas in time freely</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.710" end="00:41:29.030" style="s2">and willingly to everything but we also</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.110" end="00:41:31.430" style="s2">want the projects because that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.030" end="00:41:33.470" style="s2">be in game V space or a lot of energy is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.430" end="00:41:35.780" style="s2">right and that&#39;s where you actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.470" end="00:41:37.730" style="s2">apply the work as it were right so if</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.780" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">you&#39;re coming with talent there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.730" end="00:41:41.690" style="s2">nowhere to apply that talent why are we</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:43.580" style="s2">doing all right I also feel this has</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.690" end="00:41:45.860" style="s2">been like for the least of us 50 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.580" end="00:41:51.740" style="s2">of Brisco conversation greatly John</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.860" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">history what are your thoughts I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.740" end="00:41:57.650" style="s2">just typing up some stuff in the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:42:00.380" style="s2">some ideas and some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.650" end="00:42:04.910" style="s2">you&#39;ve been talking about I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.380" end="00:42:08.200" style="s2">what I caught them well I was also</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.910" end="00:42:12.710" style="s2">wondering like so we all I think assume</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.200" end="00:42:15.560" style="s2">okay we have video conversations do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.710" end="00:42:17.620" style="s2">also want to have a chat and things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.560" end="00:42:17.620" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.440" end="00:42:22.760" style="s2">I think I think something like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.089" end="00:42:27.500" style="s2">would be probably also quite important</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.760" end="00:42:32.450" style="s2">and then to each of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.500" end="00:42:36.380" style="s2">having the ability to catch something at</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.450" end="00:42:39.109" style="s2">a document or some some posts to keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.380" end="00:42:42.260" style="s2">summaries and maybe before that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.109" end="00:42:45.140" style="s2">questions or so that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.260" end="00:42:49.309" style="s2">the next one or whatever so that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.140" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">can see a little bit in text form what</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.309" end="00:42:54.740" style="s2">is this about um just giving some</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:57.319" style="s2">context I think a lot of it is just the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.740" end="00:42:59.960" style="s2">projects doing it what like it right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.319" end="00:43:02.000" style="s2">you for your project if you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.960" end="00:43:04.670" style="s2">people interested your number one goal</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:06.589" style="s2">is just to move your project forward so</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.670" end="00:43:08.150" style="s2">as soon as you get the person interested</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.589" end="00:43:09.230" style="s2">if they want to chat if they want to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.150" end="00:43:11.569" style="s2">a phone call if they want to send</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.230" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">postcards whatever you agree is the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.569" end="00:43:16.339" style="s2">that you want to communicate you try it</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:19.069" style="s2">out I think sort of the next step there</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.339" end="00:43:21.410" style="s2">is we make some sort of a mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.069" end="00:43:24.069" style="s2">group or a cooperation counselor however</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.410" end="00:43:26.930" style="s2">its structured and so let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.069" end="00:43:29.299" style="s2">Bentley Jonas and I meet as sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.930" end="00:43:30.890" style="s2">the sense-making group and Eunice talks</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.299" end="00:43:32.510" style="s2">about what he&#39;s been doing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.890" end="00:43:34.190" style="s2">working for his projects and dentally</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.510" end="00:43:36.020" style="s2">talks about oh I just tried this for</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.190" end="00:43:38.029" style="s2">reason score and it worked great or it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.020" end="00:43:39.619" style="s2">didn&#39;t work so well and we start to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.029" end="00:43:41.210" style="s2">what works in and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.619" end="00:43:43.309" style="s2">then when we&#39;re working on the meta</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.210" end="00:43:45.230" style="s2">project we take those exact learnings</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.309" end="00:43:47.180" style="s2">and say okay well two of us tried this</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.230" end="00:43:48.289" style="s2">and it worked this seems like something</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.180" end="00:43:51.559" style="s2">that maybe we can recommend other</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.289" end="00:43:52.849" style="s2">projects do and maybe you know Jonas and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.559" end="00:43:53.990" style="s2">I tried something and I really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.849" end="00:43:55.609" style="s2">work so we say all right we tried this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.990" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t work great will advise against</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.609" end="00:43:59.299" style="s2">this and we start to actually get some</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:01.069" style="s2">data points as we&#39;re trying things up</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.299" end="00:44:03.109" style="s2">for our projects and then trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.069" end="00:44:09.289" style="s2">apply those learnings to building the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.109" end="00:44:11.450" style="s2">meta project does that make sense yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.289" end="00:44:18.680" style="s2">think it does make sense I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.450" end="00:44:21.849" style="s2">whether yeah so those learnings that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.680" end="00:44:24.829" style="s2">applied them to okay how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.849" end="00:44:30.650" style="s2">get more people involved and interested</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.829" end="00:44:31.820" style="s2">in other future our projects is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.650" end="00:44:34.590" style="s2">what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.820" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">partially yeah so there&#39;s a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.590" end="00:44:37.410" style="s2">right there&#39;s trying to generate</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.570" style="s2">interest and that&#39;s one thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.410" end="00:44:40.890" style="s2">all want to do for our project so</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.570" end="00:44:43.050" style="s2">there&#39;s different strategies there and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.890" end="00:44:45.600" style="s2">things of hey we all tried this to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.050" end="00:44:47.610" style="s2">people interested on our own there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.600" end="00:44:49.950" style="s2">also the meta project will have its own</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.610" end="00:44:51.420" style="s2">way to try to get people interested that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.950" end="00:44:56.490" style="s2">we can&#39;t really replicate anywhere cuz</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.420" end="00:44:58.050" style="s2">there&#39;s only one that a project but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.490" end="00:45:01.290" style="s2">things that we&#39;re trying individually in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.050" end="00:45:03.120" style="s2">projects that&#39;s sort of our petri dishes</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.290" end="00:45:05.160" style="s2">right so we can each have our own thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.120" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">and then as we&#39;re trying to eat these</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.160" end="00:45:08.760" style="s2">things that hey I tried this on my</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:11.190" style="s2">project either at work or it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.760" end="00:45:12.420" style="s2">here&#39;s one data point and then if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.190" end="00:45:13.890" style="s2">each do it we&#39;ll have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.420" end="00:45:17.310" style="s2">different data points that we can start</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.890" end="00:45:20.370" style="s2">to see what works and what doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.310" end="00:45:22.710" style="s2">gives us one sort of frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.370" end="00:45:24.540" style="s2">for if you have a project like ours</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.710" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">here&#39;s things that we&#39;ve tried and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.540" end="00:45:27.750" style="s2">trying to build a framework so if we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">ten projects that are kind of similar</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.750" end="00:45:31.800" style="s2">involved and they all try this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:36.320" style="s2">it works for nine of them that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.800" end="00:45:38.610" style="s2">good okay we might recommend that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.320" end="00:45:40.710" style="s2">and that can be including trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.610" end="00:45:42.930" style="s2">people on board but they can also be</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.710" end="00:45:43.710" style="s2">trying to coordinate with people trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.930" end="00:45:46.020" style="s2">to build things</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">anything from start to finish of your</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.020" end="00:45:51.290" style="s2">project in the end the meta project kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.400" style="s2">of needs to help with all of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.290" end="00:45:55.620" style="s2">yeah so I think at the beginning what</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.400" end="00:45:56.910" style="s2">you&#39;re honest is like having if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.620" end="00:45:58.170" style="s2">have if we&#39;re facilitating a video</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.910" end="00:46:00.510" style="s2">conversation and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.170" end="00:46:02.280" style="s2">schedulers doing one of the first things</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.510" end="00:46:03.930" style="s2">needs to be right and how do we keep in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.280" end="00:46:06.150" style="s2">contact outside of this right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.930" end="00:46:08.100" style="s2">like and that will be a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.150" end="00:46:09.930" style="s2">each bird needs to have and they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.100" end="00:46:12.540" style="s2">beyond what&#39;s up are we on Facebook are</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.930" end="00:46:14.550" style="s2">be on and missing but honestly a space</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.540" end="00:46:17.070" style="s2">that&#39;s like the URL it&#39;s the Google Doc</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.550" end="00:46:19.500" style="s2">or we&#39;re on Facebook writing it like</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.070" end="00:46:22.980" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided this is the best bet for</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.500" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">this group and constantly Burnie coming</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.980" end="00:46:28.170" style="s2">into it with this is well I&#39;m not on</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:29.910" style="s2">Facebook right I&#39;m not I&#39;m not on it</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.170" end="00:46:32.100" style="s2">what&#39;s up it&#39;s like right but this group</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.910" end="00:46:33.750" style="s2">is so you&#39;re kind of and eventually we</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.100" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">get to the meta problem of we need our</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.750" end="00:46:39.300" style="s2">own exactly end up being something that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:40.740" style="s2">for each project if we&#39;re tracking it</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.300" end="00:46:42.360" style="s2">that might be one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.740" end="00:46:44.670" style="s2">we&#39;re tracking is like here&#39;s how this</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.360" end="00:46:45.450" style="s2">group is communicating if you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.670" end="00:46:46.770" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.450" end="00:46:50.190" style="s2">communicate on that channel don&#39;t join</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.770" end="00:46:52.260" style="s2">that group and then in the end the goal</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.190" end="00:46:54.119" style="s2">had a platform that we&#39;re all on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.260" end="00:46:57.599" style="s2">same thing and that sort of takes out</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.119" end="00:47:00.450" style="s2">that friction yeah yeah I do kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.599" end="00:47:02.220" style="s2">the scheduler as a separate I mean these</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.450" end="00:47:04.799" style="s2">things may be tied together but I kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.220" end="00:47:07.619" style="s2">of see it as separate from the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.799" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">like database of projects and then my</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.619" end="00:47:12.839" style="s2">preference would be not to have any sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:14.250" style="s2">of chat functionality or comment</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.839" end="00:47:17.160" style="s2">functionality on the database of</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.250" end="00:47:18.599" style="s2">projects keep that very lean and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.160" end="00:47:21.150" style="s2">could just link out to where their</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.599" end="00:47:23.819" style="s2">community is and so we need to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.150" end="00:47:27.660" style="s2">data set within the or my suggestion is</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.819" end="00:47:31.770" style="s2">to keep the data within the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.660" end="00:47:34.740" style="s2">project listing as minimal as possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.770" end="00:47:36.569" style="s2">now that&#39;s Jonas is probably getting at</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.740" end="00:47:40.260" style="s2">how to make it attractive which of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.569" end="00:47:41.910" style="s2">course that&#39;s not very attractive but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.260" end="00:47:43.559" style="s2">also don&#39;t want to make another place</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.910" end="00:47:47.460" style="s2">that these project managers have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.559" end="00:47:48.930" style="s2">monitor and maintain right - to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.460" end="00:47:51.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that we actually do the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.930" end="00:47:54.630" style="s2">communication in the tool I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.030" end="00:47:57.420" style="s2">that we specify like set in stone - just</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.630" end="00:47:59.670" style="s2">say anyway you know so for this project</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.420" end="00:48:02.010" style="s2">if he says he wants to use whatsapp</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.670" end="00:48:03.900" style="s2">great in the project it says this</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.010" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">project uses whatsapp that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.900" end="00:48:06.869" style="s2">communicate if you&#39;re gonna join that</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:08.549" style="s2">project you better off watch that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.869" end="00:48:10.140" style="s2">because otherwise I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.549" end="00:48:12.869" style="s2">think that was John this is suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.140" end="00:48:17.160" style="s2">but yes I was more replying to Jonah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.869" end="00:48:20.369" style="s2">suggestion than yours yeah that makes</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.160" end="00:48:23.430" style="s2">sense yeah I I was yeah yeah yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.369" end="00:48:28.200" style="s2">completely right I was thinking in terms</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.430" end="00:48:30.630" style="s2">of you know if we have all the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.200" end="00:48:35.210" style="s2">facilitate communication and track</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.630" end="00:48:38.099" style="s2">keeping and some external that well</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.210" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll make it all complicated slower</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.099" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">unattractive whatever and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:44.400" style="s2">thinking in my head I okay good we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:47.540" style="s2">this thing where we have everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.400" end="00:48:50.790" style="s2">internal and practical and stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.540" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">definitely one thing is it creates</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.790" end="00:48:57.690" style="s2">additional overhead for moderating and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.680" end="00:48:58.870" style="s2">forever and also we would need to create</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.690" end="00:49:03.790" style="s2">it which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.870" end="00:49:06.520" style="s2">lot of work so um it may be seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.790" end="00:49:09.670" style="s2">Fiat Li we we definitely have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.520" end="00:49:13.090" style="s2">everything more less everything external</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.670" end="00:49:15.700" style="s2">um and then after some while we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.090" end="00:49:19.690" style="s2">reassess that if we want to bring some</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.700" end="00:49:22.150" style="s2">often maybe most useful things so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.690" end="00:49:24.970" style="s2">think we could we could start that right</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.150" end="00:49:26.980" style="s2">now like the database of projects just</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.970" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">open up a Google spreadsheet to be an</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.980" end="00:49:34.510" style="s2">open edit and then add your own me and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:37.300" style="s2">Jonas put in our projects and and jublee</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.510" end="00:49:39.190" style="s2">or I could put in together tech as its</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.300" end="00:49:41.590" style="s2">own project and put those links like</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.190" end="00:49:42.580" style="s2">where do you communicate just you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.590" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">we can start figuring out what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.580" end="00:49:47.650" style="s2">columns are as we need them that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:50.650" style="s2">way to kind of start yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:52.330" style="s2">finally starts at Google&#39;s especially my</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.650" end="00:49:53.950" style="s2">end goal was to put that in a core</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.330" end="00:49:55.960" style="s2">bubble or wherever so that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.950" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">like a little project so with the people</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.960" end="00:49:59.710" style="s2">and then the projects that will end up</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:01.780" style="s2">getting fairly unwieldy and we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.710" end="00:50:08.200" style="s2">decide what to show and want to hide and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.780" end="00:50:09.700" style="s2">do and who sees what so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.200" end="00:50:11.740" style="s2">things that&#39;s a little less techie</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.700" end="00:50:13.930" style="s2">that&#39;s that for what you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.740" end="00:50:16.870" style="s2">talking the ly said like three different</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.930" end="00:50:19.120" style="s2">types of projects that the scheduler can</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.870" end="00:50:23.080" style="s2">do and I think instead of you know make</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.120" end="00:50:25.840" style="s2">a rule faster mind would love having it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.080" end="00:50:27.160" style="s2">be one-off conversations right like ones</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.840" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">where it&#39;s like I want to have one</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.160" end="00:50:31.750" style="s2">conversation about Star Trek and game B</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:33.130" style="s2">and here&#39;s a schedule set right and if</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.750" end="00:50:35.320" style="s2">there&#39;s different people available at</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.130" end="00:50:38.470" style="s2">different times it makes one-off</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.320" end="00:50:40.150" style="s2">conversations forever anyone as well as</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.470" end="00:50:41.740" style="s2">forming a group writes you&#39;re gonna meet</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.150" end="00:50:44.020" style="s2">with the same people weekly that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.740" end="00:50:45.670" style="s2">mastermind group that&#39;s let&#39;s talk to</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.020" end="00:50:48.190" style="s2">Star Trek every week let&#39;s have a Star</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.670" end="00:50:50.830" style="s2">Trek you know conversation and then also</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.190" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">conferences so that maybe you have a big</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.830" end="00:50:53.380" style="s2">problem you want to solve what does that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:55.480" style="s2">look like that one&#39;s gonna be much more</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.380" end="00:50:57.070" style="s2">difficult but it&#39;s just getting a number</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.480" end="00:50:59.740" style="s2">of people to a bigger chunk of time</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.070" end="00:51:03.190" style="s2">right or repeated ties and then breaking</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.740" end="00:51:05.080" style="s2">them off into groups and that in and of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.190" end="00:51:06.870" style="s2">itself both brings people at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.080" end="00:51:09.310" style="s2">conference it&#39;s gonna bring new people</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.870" end="00:51:10.660" style="s2">one-off conversations brings new people</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.310" end="00:51:12.070" style="s2">and then you&#39;re gonna keep coming back</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.660" end="00:51:12.520" style="s2">for the group right to build that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.070" end="00:51:14.950" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.520" end="00:51:18.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like micro Sol linearity groups</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.950" end="00:51:20.020" style="s2">facilitated by the macro scheduler that</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.130" end="00:51:21.310" style="s2">is as beta as possible in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.020" end="00:51:23.320" style="s2">maybe we only do one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.310" end="00:51:24.370" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s just one-off conversations</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.320" end="00:51:26.500" style="s2">once you&#39;ve scheduled a one-off</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.370" end="00:51:28.540" style="s2">conversation you just keep coming back</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.500" end="00:51:32.080" style="s2">weekly if you want to you know like</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.540" end="00:51:35.110" style="s2">something that&#39;s yeah simpler I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.080" end="00:51:37.030" style="s2">the scheduler the the niche that is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.110" end="00:51:39.370" style="s2">fulfilled by current tech is mostly that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.030" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">piece of getting together with four</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.370" end="00:51:43.270" style="s2">random people out of a larger group of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:44.800" style="s2">people because if you do have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.270" end="00:51:47.500" style="s2">recurrent group then you could use</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:49.480" style="s2">something like doodle and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.500" end="00:51:51.130" style="s2">conference then really it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.480" end="00:51:55.090" style="s2">conference organizers or schedule that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.130" end="00:51:56.680" style="s2">kind of sets it so I think we can expand</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.090" end="00:52:00.340" style="s2">it those but I think the beginning is</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.680" end="00:52:01.840" style="s2">you know we have 50 people and game B if</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.340" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">I wanted to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.840" end="00:52:10.060" style="s2">random four people it&#39;s a pain right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:12.910" style="s2">to do that mm-hmm but how is how is what</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.060" end="00:52:16.210" style="s2">we are creating really helping in that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.910" end="00:52:18.760" style="s2">mean Jubilee already you know posts in</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.210" end="00:52:25.510" style="s2">in Facebook about some of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.760" end="00:52:28.740" style="s2">conversations is it like the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.510" end="00:52:33.160" style="s2">these conversations are set in time and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.740" end="00:52:36.090" style="s2">with our scheduler they are flexible and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.160" end="00:52:39.700" style="s2">we can come with some other people to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.090" end="00:52:43.660" style="s2">different time agreement that would like</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.700" end="00:52:47.620" style="s2">help a lot or yeah I think it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.660" end="00:52:49.180" style="s2">right now there Julie&#39;s initiative and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.620" end="00:52:52.540" style="s2">so she&#39;s saying up the times and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.180" end="00:52:57.670" style="s2">of people can&#39;t make those times and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.540" end="00:52:59.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit of a pain on her it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.670" end="00:53:01.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of work for her and it would</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.530" end="00:53:03.010" style="s2">be a lot of work for anyone else trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.030" end="00:53:04.540" style="s2">to do it and I can only schedule one</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.010" end="00:53:08.290" style="s2">conversation right there just the ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.540" end="00:53:10.900" style="s2">I&#39;m part of the idea is if we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.290" end="00:53:12.430" style="s2">to arrange conversations for specific</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.900" end="00:53:14.380" style="s2">topics is the key thing that we&#39;re truck</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.430" end="00:53:17.230" style="s2">like if they do pick one of these two to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.380" end="00:53:19.360" style="s2">fix first is it trying to find a time</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.230" end="00:53:21.550" style="s2">that works for everyone or is it trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.360" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">to identify like these topics that</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.550" end="00:53:24.300" style="s2">people want to meet on and who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:26.200" style="s2">meet on them and how many are there</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.300" end="00:53:27.549" style="s2">the scheduler part</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.200" end="00:53:30.099" style="s2">about the topic because the taught like</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.549" end="00:53:31.420" style="s2">the idea is were individuals who can</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.099" end="00:53:32.799" style="s2">come up with a topic and then I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.420" end="00:53:34.599" style="s2">bring people together to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.799" end="00:53:36.279" style="s2">topic so we can generate topics all day</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.599" end="00:53:38.740" style="s2">long it&#39;s not really we don&#39;t want like</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.279" end="00:53:40.839" style="s2">a set number of topics and then we might</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.740" end="00:53:42.369" style="s2">want a set number for efficiency and for</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.839" end="00:53:43.779" style="s2">bringing people together like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.369" end="00:53:46.210" style="s2">talking about these three ones so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.779" end="00:53:47.410" style="s2">not dissipating the energy but mainly if</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.210" end="00:53:50.470" style="s2">you can get people together to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.410" end="00:53:52.539" style="s2">about something um they&#39;re gonna like</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.470" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">it&#39;s finding those people and fighting</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.539" end="00:53:55.690" style="s2">the time they&#39;re available and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">being able to reproduces so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.690" end="00:53:59.619" style="s2">everyone watching our idea Cafe is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:01.480" style="s2">people getting to participate in idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.619" end="00:54:05.170" style="s2">cafe right getting to actually have</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.480" end="00:54:07.750" style="s2">those conversations and on on topics</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.170" end="00:54:10.089" style="s2">that are of interest to them and and to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.750" end="00:54:13.510" style="s2">be clear I think we have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.089" end="00:54:17.490" style="s2">combined these two concepts there is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.510" end="00:54:21.519" style="s2">like building together tech and building</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.490" end="00:54:23.230" style="s2">this when really the core niche for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.519" end="00:54:28.269" style="s2">scheduler is really kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.230" end="00:54:29.859" style="s2">building a community and our our focus</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.269" end="00:54:32.019" style="s2">of it right now is game B but could be</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.859" end="00:54:35.339" style="s2">other communities and having broader</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.019" end="00:54:38.680" style="s2">kind of nebulous discussions between a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.339" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">large group of people by having a meta</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.680" end="00:54:44.440" style="s2">rate on topics and stuff so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:45.990" style="s2">jublia correct me if I&#39;m wrong if those</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.440" end="00:54:49.180" style="s2">are actually kind of like two different</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.990" end="00:54:51.579" style="s2">goals I mean one kind of feeds into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.180" end="00:54:52.930" style="s2">other but you know I&#39;m saying so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.579" end="00:54:54.970" style="s2">know that the scheduler is actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.930" end="00:54:57.849" style="s2">directly related to us getting more</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.970" end="00:55:02.410" style="s2">people to work on projects now that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.849" end="00:55:04.029" style="s2">thinking about it in my mind it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.410" end="00:55:07.390" style="s2">like the scheduler something will end up</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.029" end="00:55:09.849" style="s2">needing once we not even hit scale but</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.390" end="00:55:11.500" style="s2">like yet you know let&#39;s say 50 people</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.849" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">involved there&#39;s gonna be a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.500" end="00:55:15.130" style="s2">point where like all right we have them</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:17.319" style="s2">involved they want to work on it you</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.130" end="00:55:19.390" style="s2">know a drill or Jubilee or Bentley or or</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.319" end="00:55:20.410" style="s2">whoever is doing the actual scheduling</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.390" end="00:55:21.630" style="s2">is like you know what with spending</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.410" end="00:55:23.579" style="s2">eight hours a week on this this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.630" end="00:55:26.349" style="s2">ridiculous we have to automate this</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.579" end="00:55:28.779" style="s2">mmm-hmm I can sort of you do it manually</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.349" end="00:55:30.549" style="s2">until it&#39;s painful and then you say okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.779" end="00:55:33.369" style="s2">we need to start to work on this it can</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.549" end="00:55:36.250" style="s2">be issue is it&#39;s already painful because</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.369" end="00:55:37.660" style="s2">of time zones right like if we all have</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.250" end="00:55:39.960" style="s2">the same time zone then it&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.660" end="00:55:42.280" style="s2">who&#39;s available with it so when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.960" end="00:55:43.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like what time is that your time</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.280" end="00:55:46.450" style="s2">how do we find a time that works for all</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.780" end="00:55:48.070" style="s2">of us it doesn&#39;t exist out there yet and</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.450" end="00:55:52.420" style="s2">having something like that where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.070" end="00:55:54.700" style="s2">just like sorry say that saying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.420" end="00:55:57.610" style="s2">group of people their time zones and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.700" end="00:56:04.990" style="s2">what times work for everyone but</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.610" end="00:56:08.980" style="s2">everyone for flavor but really how many</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.990" end="00:56:11.500" style="s2">people did you have that were interested</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.980" end="00:56:14.560" style="s2">in in your conversations that couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.500" end="00:56:17.650" style="s2">come because of time zone I mean right</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.560" end="00:56:22.030" style="s2">now for example I&#39;m wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.650" end="00:56:25.630" style="s2">these are really many people mm-hmm like</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.030" end="00:56:28.990" style="s2">I&#39;m in your sealant I&#39;m I&#39;m actually for</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.630" end="00:56:31.750" style="s2">me it&#39;s Saturday morning and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.990" end="00:56:34.390" style="s2">the project racing is at 6:00 a.m. in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.750" end="00:56:39.550" style="s2">the morning for me but I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.390" end="00:56:41.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m coming but how many people do</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.550" end="00:56:43.300" style="s2">they say are now at this time doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.380" end="00:56:48.790" style="s2">work and that&#39;s why I&#39;m not coming I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.300" end="00:56:51.370" style="s2">definitely restricted that way you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.790" end="00:56:53.620" style="s2">been in many of our cults already on</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.370" end="00:56:55.420" style="s2">weekends but I&#39;m actually here on my</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.620" end="00:56:57.070" style="s2">lunch break right now so I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.420" end="00:56:59.170" style="s2">like arrange it there and arranged</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.070" end="00:57:01.660" style="s2">around it but if it was like an hour</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.170" end="00:57:03.580" style="s2">earlier later I probably couldn&#39;t well I</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.660" end="00:57:05.530" style="s2">really don&#39;t know how many more people</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.580" end="00:57:07.660" style="s2">would be able to attend one of these if</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.530" end="00:57:09.670" style="s2">we had the scheduler that&#39;s poor I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.660" end="00:57:12.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a valid question yeah and if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.670" end="00:57:14.740" style="s2">were in let&#39;s say like India would the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.070" end="00:57:16.240" style="s2">time zones overlap it&#39;s the wrong way to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.740" end="00:57:19.300" style="s2">not let you attend because you know it</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.240" end="00:57:26.440" style="s2">would be 11 p.m. or 1 a.m. er well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.300" end="00:57:29.580" style="s2">whatever time okay yeah I&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.440" end="00:57:33.540" style="s2">like yeah with I&#39;m having similar</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.580" end="00:57:39.070" style="s2">concerns as Bentley in any way that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.540" end="00:57:41.200" style="s2">also a drill that I&#39;m wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.070" end="00:57:44.020" style="s2">what we are discussing about will really</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.200" end="00:57:48.550" style="s2">make it more attractive to people to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.020" end="00:57:54.360" style="s2">come and this initial step of getting to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.550" end="00:57:57.580" style="s2">a 50 people participation or so</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.360" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">at that time then I can definitely see</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.580" end="00:58:04.510" style="s2">our a scheduler would be really great</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:07.600" style="s2">but before that I&#39;m wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.510" end="00:58:12.690" style="s2">there might be something that it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.600" end="00:58:15.670" style="s2">more useful yeah yeah I know almost like</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.690" end="00:58:17.290" style="s2">we need I think we need an in-between</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.670" end="00:58:18.850" style="s2">step from where we are now where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.290" end="00:58:20.380" style="s2">this sort of nebulous thing of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.850" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">can post stuff on Facebook and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.380" end="00:58:22.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t great for this anyway because</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:25.180" style="s2">you&#39;re never sure which posts you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.750" end="00:58:28.060" style="s2">seeing and you know you&#39;re at the mercy</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.180" end="00:58:29.410" style="s2">of their algorithm as opposed to putting</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.060" end="00:58:31.330" style="s2">it somewhere else like you know a Google</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.410" end="00:58:32.890" style="s2">sheet or knack or bubble and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.330" end="00:58:35.110" style="s2">have a list of here&#39;s all of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.890" end="00:58:37.270" style="s2">meetings that people want to touch a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.110" end="00:58:38.950" style="s2">host and if they&#39;re for a purpose like</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.270" end="00:58:40.690" style="s2">so if jubilee says oh I want to hold</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.950" end="00:58:43.120" style="s2">something you know on Sundays at 2:00</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.690" end="00:58:45.790" style="s2">p.m. my time cool here&#39;s a time people</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.120" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">can sign up for it start with just a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.790" end="00:58:50.530" style="s2">really simple approach that sort of we</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.680" end="00:58:53.380" style="s2">have more control over and then our our</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.530" end="00:58:55.120" style="s2">first goal is to make that a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.380" end="00:58:56.260" style="s2">to get so many people involved and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.120" end="00:58:59.110" style="s2">interested in raising their hand and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.260" end="00:59:01.750" style="s2">saying I want to participate in these</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.110" end="00:59:04.300" style="s2">times or I want to participate but you</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.750" end="00:59:06.250" style="s2">don&#39;t have a time that works for me just</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.300" end="00:59:08.140" style="s2">start that to start just building to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.250" end="00:59:10.420" style="s2">deal with the people where our whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.140" end="00:59:13.480" style="s2">goal is to make these scheduler become a</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.420" end="00:59:16.060" style="s2">necessity yeah and I think that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.480" end="00:59:17.830" style="s2">happy not in a way that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.060" end="00:59:19.780" style="s2">great like we&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.830" end="00:59:20.980" style="s2">conversation on YouTube so that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.780" end="00:59:22.180" style="s2">barrier to some people right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.980" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">want to be live they don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.180" end="00:59:26.740" style="s2">but like when you write we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:29.560" style="s2">move on to zoom right you&#39;re like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.740" end="00:59:31.210" style="s2">not where there&#39;s enough people we want</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.560" end="00:59:32.950" style="s2">more people than we want you know to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.210" end="00:59:35.560" style="s2">necessarily to be here there&#39;s tons of</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.950" end="00:59:37.060" style="s2">conversations to happen on zoom but</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.560" end="00:59:40.900" style="s2">people need to know they&#39;re happening</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.060" end="00:59:43.150" style="s2">and then show up to them to the leader</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.900" end="00:59:45.910" style="s2">if it&#39;s live or not like comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.150" end="00:59:50.320" style="s2">being live cool yours will probably be</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.910" end="00:59:52.030" style="s2">yellow but having a calendar for all of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.320" end="00:59:54.430" style="s2">the conversations that people are</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.030" end="00:59:56.080" style="s2">willing to be part of as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.430" end="00:59:58.270" style="s2">barrier right here on the street yard</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.080" end="00:59:59.620" style="s2">six is the maximum and quite frankly</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.270" end="01:00:01.420" style="s2">because this is our fix our world Friday</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.620" end="01:00:02.770" style="s2">we probably don&#39;t want people to showing</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.420" end="01:00:03.910" style="s2">up and being part of it because it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:01:10.180" end="01:01:14.230" style="s2">little bit before becomes super painful</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.890" end="01:01:16.900" style="s2">so that we have time to actually work on</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.230" end="01:01:18.730" style="s2">it and thing and then we have our team</p>
