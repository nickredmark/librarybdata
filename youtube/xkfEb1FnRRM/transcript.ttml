<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">okay i&#39;m going to move over to the white</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">board so we can begin their dharma talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">so we are finishing up with uh stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">and i want to remind you</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">of where we&#39;ve been and i want to give</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:24.839" style="s2">you a bit of the pedagogical structure</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">that we&#39;ve come through so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.839" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">epic for short and here&#39;s stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:36.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re heading towards neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">and so we can think of these as</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">and we can think of the core practices</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">within epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">we can think of like inside here is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">pleasure diet</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">structuring your pleasures and then we</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.839" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">disciplining the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">practices for stopping the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">from terrifying us</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a savoring practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">and then in here there&#39;s an overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">practice which is the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">fellowship practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">the philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">companionship</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">but i&#39;ve started calling it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">philosophical fellowship practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">ran lav emailed me he&#39;s fine with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">um he and i are going to talk so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">very cool of course in stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:47.160" style="s2">uh we have self-examination</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">cultivation of virtue we have active</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.160" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">we have the view from above we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">objective seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">we have the pre-meditation now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">going to do a practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">that is going to be uh that bridges</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:05.120" style="s2">between overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">neoplatonism and this is what bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.120" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">stoic meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.959" end="00:17:12.799" style="s2">i think a better way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">because it involves both meditative and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.799" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">i want to call this practice and i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">be much more helpful to us this way i</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">want to call this invoking</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">the logos invoking the logos</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">and then that will take us into neoplate</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">and zoom proper where we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">uh theoria theorgia</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">theologia don&#39;t be put off by this term</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">if you happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">a non-theist or an atheist and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">dialectic into the logos</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">practices here</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">uh we still have to go with in you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">platonism</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">but now we&#39;re going to do this uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">practice based on</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">um bizarre&#39;s work now why do i say it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">uh stoke uh with neoplatonism uh she has</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">drawn this</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">uh from uh hashiatic prayer</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">hashism i think that&#39;s the way you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">pronounce it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">anyways it comes from heshia which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">a greek word for divine quietness divine</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">silence</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">and this is drawn from the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">orthodox tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">and that is deeply meal platinum so</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">while i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">she is right in capturing</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">that this is uh overlaps with stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">it clearly overlaps with neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">and trying to actually divide these two</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">is not that helpful because</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">stoicism actually gets taken up into</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">neoplatonism neoplatonism combines</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">aspects of aristotle and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">aspects of plato</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">all together so well we&#39;ll see that of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">course when we begin</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">the neoplatonic when we begin the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">university uh when we move into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">grove</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">okay garden uh porch and grove</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">elementary school high school university</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s concentrate on this</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">practice today</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">invoking the logos</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">so this notion of logos is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">to the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">and they got the notion from heraclitus</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">a pre-socratic philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">and so let&#39;s talk about what logos means</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">so logos means a gathering ordering</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.919" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">gathering things together</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">ordering them so that they belong</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">together like when you pick</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">a bunch of flowers you gather them</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">together and then you order them</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">together into a bouquet</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">or you gather together a group of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">and you organize them into a company so</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">can fight together so the logos is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">gathering</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">ordering principle</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">in process</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">now that&#39;s a lot but that&#39;s because this</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">word logos is almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.679" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">uh it&#39;s very similar to the eastern term</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">dharma which means</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">so many things all together out all at</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">and so let me try and give you a more a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">concrete example of this like</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">from a word that is directly derived</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">from this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">logic okay so what are we doing with</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">logic</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">we&#39;re gathering words or thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">but not just higgledy piggledy we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">gathering them and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">ordering them into propositions right</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">and then what we&#39;re doing is we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">working according to certain principles</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">like non-contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">and then what we do is that principle is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">put into practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">it&#39;s put into practice or process</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">when we do something like deduction so</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">let&#39;s notice what&#39;s going to happen here</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">i&#39;m going to gather words together so</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">they belong together</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">into sentences and then i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">abide by the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">non-contradiction in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">deduction</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">all men are mortal socrates is a man</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">therefore socrates is mortal right i</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">gathered and ordered</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">according to principles and then i put</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">that into process</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">and so logic was taken as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">quintessential example of logos but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">problem is we have tended to forget</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">that logic is only an example of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">this where logos is often translated</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">as word uh so if you read the the gospel</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">of john</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.760" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">it it it gets us to try to refigure</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">reconfigure reinterpret the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.080" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">so genesis begins within the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">god created in the heavens and the earth</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">the gospel of john begins with in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">beginning was the word but</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the english but what it says in</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">greek is in the beginning was the logos</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">and the logos was</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">with god and the logos was god and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">this idea about that the logos has this</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">intimate relationship with ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">reality and the ground uh the grounding</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">of our experience of what is sacred</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">or if you&#39;re more religious what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">divine</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">so you have to think of the logos as</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">trans logical</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not just logical it&#39;s the gathering</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the gathering</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">ordering principle in process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">thought it&#39;s the gathering ordering</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">principle in process</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">of everything everything and systems of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">all have logos they all have this kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">intelligibility that makes them to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">what they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">and makes them it makes them knowable it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">makes them both to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">and to be known so it&#39;s insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">everything has a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">that makes it be what it is it has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">and to know it is precisely to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">that structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:37.080" style="s2">to grasp its logos that&#39;s why we put</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">logos at the end of all of our studies</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.080" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">anthropology right</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">is anthropo anthropos logos</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">psychology is suke logos</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">logos of the suke logos of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">be a human being</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">that&#39;s right if you gather all of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">threads back together you can re-weave</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">the tapestry</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">of what logos is and what it is for</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">the stoics so</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">one way to ultimately think about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">gathering this all together</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">is how is to think about it as the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">self-presencing of everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">okay so everything it everything is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">presenting</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">it&#39;s presenting itself as something to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">right but there&#39;s always more right that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">it can present itself as</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">so my here&#39;s a marker i&#39;ve grasped</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">part of its features it&#39;s structural</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">it&#39;s present to me as a marker but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">could also be present to me as</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">a spear etc and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">think about the fact that this don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">think of this as just a static snapshot</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">there is an ongoing process by which</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">this is being</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">and why they when and and by which it</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">can be known</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s an unfolding it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">intelligibility everything is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">self-presencing notice that when we want</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">a word</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:06.159" style="s2">uh that talks about how we think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">things we use this idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.159" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">of representation</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.159" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">a representation like like like words</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">here&#39;s cat that&#39;s a representation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">cats or a picture of a cat</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">what it does is it makes the cat</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">presence itself to me again</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">right so this making sense is the act</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">of presencing presencing to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">mind so the idea is it was presencing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">as a cat and now it&#39;s representing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">the in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">as the thought or concept of a cat so</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">with the logos actually combines those</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">two together the presencing of the cat</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">and the presenting of the concept of the</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">the structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">of the cat is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">made available to you now this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">fairly abstract but like i said if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:02.640" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:05.279" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re invoking this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.640" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">we&#39;re invoking the idea that things are</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">making sense to us and that that making</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">sense is something</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">we&#39;re doing but also something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">receiving</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">it&#39;s ultimately something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">participating in we&#39;re participating in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">so from heraclitus the story&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">all of reality all of reality is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">ultimately governed</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">by logos so i use logos with a capital l</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">because what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">you can think of here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">individual logo called logoi</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">but here&#39;s the logos right of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">uh the logos of psychology but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">also the logos of specific objects</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">here&#39;s the logos of a river</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">and then the idea is they are all in</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">what and the stoics invoke this term</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:51.919" style="s2">sympathia</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">they are all resonating with each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.919" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">like layers of music and rhythm and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">melody</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">are all in harmony with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">so that overarching logos is the logos</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">with a big</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">l and that&#39;s what the gospel of john</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">means when it says in the beginning was</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">the logos it means this</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">that that principle by which things are</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">and by which they are intelligible and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">by which we can participate in their</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">self-presencing</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.919" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">okay so everything i was doing here</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">right now was logos that was logos</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">we could call these instead of dharmatox</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">it would be completely legitimate if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">were speaking it from within the western</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">to call them logos talks</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">okay now what about this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">invocation</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">it can it comes up of course in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.840" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">this notion of invocation</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.159" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">okay well first of all when we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">use of invocation where</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">what&#39;s it doing in us it should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">provoking</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">and it should be evoking a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">something new is being realized by us</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">to practice this what you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">doing are practicing two things together</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">sorry three things and i&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">acronym for it oh that was a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">okay so first there&#39;s realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">and this has that double meaning that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">was trying to convey with logos</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">there&#39;s the there&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s jane is</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">face it means</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:04.880" style="s2">making sense to me and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">realizing that process of presencing</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.880" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">to turn reality into a verb realizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">self-presencing but also affording and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">making possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">my realization of its realization</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the term that is being used here</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">your realization</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:24.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s beyond it&#39;s not you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">representing things</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.840" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">right you&#39;re partially doing that i</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">i need to use a technical term here from</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">but you&#39;re also instantiating so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">show you what i mean in concrete example</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">i can represent to myself</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">the fact that within earth&#39;s gravity i</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">have weight</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">i can think oh i know i i experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">weight</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a representation but i actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">instantiate it</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">i&#39;m actually undergoing i weight being</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">heavy</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">is self-presencing in me right now so</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">you have to think about this as you will</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">be using representations</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">but the point of that representation is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">to get your mind to couple to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">to get it deeply conformed connect</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">dynamically coupled to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">process think about the difference of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">just merely representing love</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">with a heart and instantiating love by</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">kissing somebody</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not just thinking about it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">actually activating and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">actualizing you&#39;re making an instance of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what this means</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">you&#39;re instantiating love so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:35.760" style="s2">realizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing here is you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.760" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">just representing</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">you&#39;re actually you&#39;re actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">you&#39;re actualizing how something is</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">disclosing itself to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">you&#39;re activating it you&#39;re actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">it you&#39;re opening yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">up to itself presencing so you are of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">course directing your thinking towards</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:55.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the one sense of realization but</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">letting it realize itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">in you you everything that we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">now is not something you think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">just think about it&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">are you know it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">by participating in it by being it</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">okay so realization</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">and then appreciation in the three</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">senses of the word</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">i&#39;m going to come to a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">like when i take a musical appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">i&#39;m going to experience gratitude i</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">appreciate what you just did for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">thank you so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">the value is going to increase oh that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">is appreciating in value</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">all three of these senses understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">couldn&#39;t conjoin you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">gratitude and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">a sense of value increase this</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">creates a sense of reverence</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">deep understanding that is coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">deep gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">that is coupled to a deep sense of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">new connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">and then participation</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">right so this is knowing</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">by being i&#39;ve already talked about this</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">remember the whole point of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">is this kind of joy where you realize</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">and appreciate and participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">depths of the flow of nature and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">flow of nature also comes from</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">because heraclitus thought that the flow</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">is a logos so this gives you an acronym</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">i want you to rap as a verb the logos</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">because rap is this combination of music</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">and speech</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">imagine if you take everything in music</p>

<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">and put them together that&#39;s the state</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">you have to be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">to invoke the logos you invoke it the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">way you invoke</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:29.279" style="s2">music the way you appreciate it and</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.480" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">this practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s use what she talks about</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">uh</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.320" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">mountain</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">this is number one and this is the greek</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">odd but this means state or</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">trait or habit this is you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">realizing how you inhabit your mind and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">you inhabit your mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">and so what you&#39;re trying to get here is</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">what we&#39;re going through here is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">going through layers of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">here you&#39;re picking up on the stability</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">the self-perpetuation of self-presencing</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a stability to things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">not just flipping in and out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a stability to them the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">stability of self uh perpetuation</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">think about how logic stabilizes your</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">okay and then we&#39;re going to move to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">sitting like a poppy</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why poppy particular or</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">just like a flower</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">okay so this is the greek word phusis</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">it&#39;s where we get physics from</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">but fuses doesn&#39;t mean what we now mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">by physical fuses me and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:31.359" style="s2">she&#39;s using the flower fosis means</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">blooming forth springing forth from</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">itself it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">more with self-organized emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">so what you&#39;re picking up</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">on now is the vitality of everything how</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">is there&#39;s a logos to it but that logos</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">is making everything emerge</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">all the atoms of this are being right</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">gathered together</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">ordered together so that this marker</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">emerges</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">everything it has that kind of vitality</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:58.119" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">the vitality of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.119" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">the third one is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an ascent here as you</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">can see</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">sitting like an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">here what you&#39;re trying to pick up on i</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">think she&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">uh oh i wanted to um</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">this is has to do uh with</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.240" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">hexis this has to do as i said with</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">fuses</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">and this has to do with suitcase where</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">we get the word psyche from</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">um it&#39;s she she writes it this way</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">the greek is in between our y and our u</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">so that&#39;s why you see these double</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">uh writings here</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about is an ocean now</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">think about the ways of an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got your waves of your breath</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">to help you right and think about prajna</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">so when you&#39;re taking the in-breath the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">moreness right</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:58.160" style="s2">they&#39;re all of the possibilities all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">the relations</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.160" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">and then so the mystery of the mornis</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:04.560" style="s2">and then it comes into the shining</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:06.040" style="s2">suchness the particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">so this is how everything is</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.040" end="00:37:08.760" style="s2">self-determining so we&#39;ve got how</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">everything is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.760" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">self-perpetuating texas how everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">is self-organizing that vitality of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:18.800" style="s2">and now we have how everything is</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">intelligible because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.800" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s self-determining this is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">talking about this from the guy</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">a scholar named pearl look at this word</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">it&#39;s great so when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">determine what something is</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to write make sense about</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">figure it&#39;s order</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">but when you&#39;re determined you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">right setting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">onto something and people talk about</p>

<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">that means that everything is ordered in</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">the universe</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">everything is a self-determining thing</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">like as canatus</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">so everything is self-perpetuating</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying these all are similar</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">that&#39;s the point they&#39;re all different</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">aspects they&#39;re all layers of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">everything is gathering together right</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">and it has an intelligibility it is you</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">and it is determined to be what it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">and then finally sitting like a sage</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">back to internalizing the sage and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">part of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">is noose this comes from the greek word</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">how everything has an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">self-transcendence to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">everything is much more than it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">and everything is much more than we</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">so she says when we&#39;re sitting like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:29.599" style="s2">mountain we want to sense the weight</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">of presence that stability</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.599" end="00:39:33.280" style="s2">and then when we&#39;re sitting like a puppy</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like a a flower turning towards the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">sun we want to sense the energy</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">the weight of self-presencing</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">the energy of self-presencing</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">this is like the music the rhythm the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">measure</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">of self-presencing and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">source</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">sensing the source astending reaching in</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">ineffability towards the source</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">because in the beginning it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">right in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">was the logos and the logos was with god</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">but somehow the logos also</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">so this gives us our grounding right</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">we&#39;re picking up on our grounding</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">this gives us a sense on how things are</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">emerging this gives us the things on how</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">things are ordered how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">determined</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">and this gives us uh a sense of how</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">things are ascending</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">how they are pointing back to</p>

<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">manual post i&#39;ve been struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">good methods of gathering feedback on</p>

<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">any suggestion uh so if you mean from</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:08.720" style="s2">yourself or from others</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:10.319" style="s2">um so from others you the standard</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">practices you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.319" end="00:54:14.079" style="s2">is you want to try and create a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">questionnaire and then you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.079" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">that the questionnaire is reliably</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">giving you the kind of information</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:21.839" style="s2">that gives you uh both what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.839" end="00:54:26.319" style="s2">and what you&#39;re doing wrong and so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:26.319" style="s2">often have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">re keep reconfiguring keep rewriting the</p>

<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:34.880" style="s2">until you get a set of questions it</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">seems to be reliably predictive</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.880" end="00:54:38.079" style="s2">of how well people are doing so once</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve run the test</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.079" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">on people like to to get it then what</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:43.599" style="s2">you do is you turn it around</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t ask people where they&#39;re at in</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">their practice you ask them these</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">questions you get</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">feedback from from answers to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">question and then you try to predict</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">how they&#39;re doing in their practice when</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.119" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">when your questionnaire accurately can</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">predict</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">how they&#39;re doing with their own</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">self-assessment and any</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">external measures remember what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">important is transformations in their</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">then your questionnaire is considered to</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">have a kind of validity to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">and then you can start using it you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.240" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">of course try the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit more difficult uh but</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">the thing might be do to try and work</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">this out with other people and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">apply it uh to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">manual posts i tend to rotate my head in</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">the direction i&#39;m putting my awareness</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">i think this results in me losing my</p>

<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">um is there oh yeah that this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">something that people fall into</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">is there a way of you like perhaps when</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">you&#39;re not even meditating</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">sit and practice moving your attention</p>

<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:49.040" style="s2">you can do this by the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s called a covert shift of attention</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s well established and you can get</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">better out of practice</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">so practice covert shifting of attention</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:55:58.000" style="s2">while you&#39;re just sitting not you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:15.280" style="s2">or even more so moving your head so</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">practice that a lot until you get to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.280" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">that ability</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">where you know in practice what it is to</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.000" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">and so the basic idea here is people</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">do what is wrong because they</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">misapprehend it</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">they misconstrue it as something good</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">and then so that sense the ignorance is</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">not sort of a lack of basic knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a lack of a correct understanding</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">right understanding is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:27.119" style="s2">eightfold path without a right</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">understanding uh people fall into</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.119" end="00:57:31.680" style="s2">self-deception and then the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s ultimately self-deceptive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.680" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">then that&#39;s this is analogous in some</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">ways to karma that&#39;s a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">that you know promulgates out from you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.160" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">other people catch it</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">so your self-destructiveness also</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:48.079" style="s2">becomes other destructiveness</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it is uh considered the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.079" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">source of bad acts</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">um so perhaps what was concerning you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:55.280" style="s2">about justice is</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">that justice requires a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.280" end="00:57:57.839" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t think that is being</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.839" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">violated here because the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">the the the central platonic claim is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">you the these people are failing living</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">to failing and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:12.640" style="s2">core stoicism they&#39;re failing to live up</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">to the the deepest most important</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.640" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">part of responsibility that which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">actually most</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:20.839" style="s2">in your control which is your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">overcome</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.839" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">self-deception to see things as they are</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:27.359" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:29.440" style="s2">insight and wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.359" end="00:58:31.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.440" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">failing to live up to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.119" end="00:58:35.040" style="s2">the fundamental responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">themselves because that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.040" end="00:58:39.040" style="s2">responsibility to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom is what is</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.040" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">needed to overcome self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">and prevent doing um immoral or unjust</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:47.599" style="s2">acts</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">and so and plato also turns it the other</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.599" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">way before you consider</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">doing anything evil or bad towards other</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:56.319" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">you have to first partially destroy</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.319" end="00:58:59.839" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.200" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">because you have to give in or you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.839" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">to avoid or give in</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">to self-deception which is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">self-destructive so the person</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:10.319" style="s2">this sounds strange and it may wrankle</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">us a little bit but plato argues that</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.319" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">the person that does evil</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">is actually even more harmed than any</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">harm they do</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">to each other because the idea is to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">that to another person</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">requires tremendous self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:27.520" style="s2">and self-destructive harm so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">ultimately self-harming</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:31.359" style="s2">and then the idea is nobody would</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:34.240" style="s2">willingly self-harm</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.359" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">now there are again when people do</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.240" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">self-harm they cut themselves but</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">they&#39;re diluted that that will actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:40.799" style="s2">alleviate their psychological pain</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:42.880" style="s2">and that cut and physical pain is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">best way of of ameliorating</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">uh the psychological pain which is which</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:51.920" style="s2">incorrect um so</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">i think i think that would answer your</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">question mark</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">uh about this um</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.040" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a very i this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.480" end="01:00:04.160" style="s2">um this has always been a famously</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.440" end="01:00:06.720" style="s2">challenging</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">idea from both stoicism and platonism</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.720" end="01:00:12.799" style="s2">and therefore also neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">uh and augustine for example augustine</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.799" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">famously rejected it one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:19.440" style="s2">distinctions between christianity</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">um and neo-platonism although he</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.440" end="01:00:22.960" style="s2">integrated the two together or between</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:26.079" style="s2">christianity and stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.960" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">is uh augustine thought that people were</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.079" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">actually capable of doing evil for its</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">own sake that they</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">were always licking the earth or</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">scratching</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">the open sore of lust that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the big division points</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:52.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to find</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.240" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">evidence for this augustine said he did</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.400" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:01:00.000" style="s2">just because it was wrong and i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:01.359" style="s2">i take i&#39;m to be sincere but when you</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.000" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">look at his situation</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.359" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">that love of destructiveness</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:10.799" style="s2">um it seems to be part of a pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing on his part</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.799" end="01:01:16.799" style="s2">and so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">think that that&#39;s the correct correct</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.799" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:21.920" style="s2">to put it i ultimately don&#39;t agree uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">with that notion</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.920" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">of augustine i think a better way of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">interpreting</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">original sin that&#39;s his notion it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:33.440" style="s2">like a disease within us</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">but more like the buddhist notion that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.440" end="01:01:37.359" style="s2">the very processes that make us adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">are the processes that make us</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.359" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">vulnerable uh to self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">so i i prefer thinking that in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">dukkha</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:49.040" style="s2">rather than original sin random name</p>
