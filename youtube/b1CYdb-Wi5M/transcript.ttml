<p begin="00:00:12.490" end="00:00:19.810" style="s2">or major point of disagreement is to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.610" end="00:00:21.550" style="s2">with religion and Christianity and let</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.810" end="00:00:23.560" style="s2">me start by reiterating that I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.550" end="00:00:25.660" style="s2">what he&#39;s done with the Bible stories is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.560" end="00:00:28.000" style="s2">remarkable I&#39;ve learned a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.660" end="00:00:29.199" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve seen at those lectures I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:30.669" style="s2">haven&#39;t watched all of I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.199" end="00:00:31.990" style="s2">about half of them but I&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.669" end="00:00:35.020" style="s2">huge amount from what I&#39;ve seen from</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.990" end="00:00:43.050" style="s2">those lectures and once again the way he</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.020" end="00:00:46.090" style="s2">draws in other sources to create this</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.050" end="00:00:48.640" style="s2">broad perspective from which to view</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.090" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">them has been for me anyway entirely</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.640" end="00:00:55.899" style="s2">original and and a wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:57.579" style="s2">however specifically with Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.899" end="00:01:01.030" style="s2">and this is the religion with which he</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.579" end="00:01:02.559" style="s2">most clearly identifies himself</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.030" end="00:01:05.140" style="s2">obviously I don&#39;t think that&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.559" end="00:01:06.610" style="s2">think that&#39;s open to dispute has at its</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.140" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">core something which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.610" end="00:01:16.390" style="s2">profoundly damaging and and I would like</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">to explore a little bit here so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.390" end="00:01:24.160" style="s2">pretty sure it&#39;s in a story of Noah that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:28.450" style="s2">God undertakes to man never to do the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.160" end="00:01:31.420" style="s2">whole flood thing ever again and gives</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.450" end="00:01:35.170" style="s2">him dominion over the earth and over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.420" end="00:01:37.150" style="s2">animals and so um you know this story</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.170" end="00:01:38.950" style="s2">along with I suspect many others I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.150" end="00:01:41.530" style="s2">biblical scholar I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.950" end="00:01:43.270" style="s2">the Bible well reinforces something</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.530" end="00:01:44.890" style="s2">which sneers at the very very very core</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.270" end="00:01:47.860" style="s2">of Christianity which is an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.890" end="00:01:50.830" style="s2">separation between God man and nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.860" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like a triumvirate of three</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.830" end="00:01:56.950" style="s2">separate things that God created nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:02:00.280" style="s2">God created man God inserted man into</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.950" end="00:02:04.120" style="s2">nature and God gave man dominion over</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.280" end="00:02:07.600" style="s2">nature and these ideas which I think run</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.120" end="00:02:11.319" style="s2">deep deep deep in the psyche of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.600" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">Western mind are responsible in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.319" end="00:02:18.819" style="s2">opinion for a huge amount of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:19.390" style="s2">external and internal destruction going</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.819" end="00:02:22.900" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.390" end="00:02:25.569" style="s2">moment to give you an idea of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.900" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2">talking about the or a better idea sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.569" end="00:02:29.530" style="s2">I should say what I&#39;m talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.100" end="00:02:31.750" style="s2">the Eastern philosophies in Buddhism for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.530" end="00:02:34.300" style="s2">example God or the Buddha or whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.750" end="00:02:37.510" style="s2">is in all things right I mean all things</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.300" end="00:02:40.540" style="s2">both animate and inanimate as we would</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.510" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">call them contain within them the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.540" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2">and so what you do to the world around</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:49.180" style="s2">you you also do to yourself it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.540" end="00:02:52.840" style="s2">continuous interconnected inseparable</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.180" end="00:02:54.520" style="s2">thing and you know every single thing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:56.709" style="s2">a manifestation of God is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.520" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">manifestation of the Buddha and as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.709" end="00:03:03.160" style="s2">said that which you do to your world you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:04.690" style="s2">do in a very very real way to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.160" end="00:03:11.290" style="s2">because you are the world and the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.690" end="00:03:13.989" style="s2">is you and to me this connectedness with</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.290" end="00:03:16.989" style="s2">the world around you with nature with</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.989" end="00:03:20.860" style="s2">everybody else seeing all things as God</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.989" end="00:03:23.019" style="s2">manifest in physical form or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.860" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">III think this is absent from</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.019" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2">Christianity and is for me the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:34.600" style="s2">reason not to be of that I mean I listen</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:36.970" style="s2">the teachings of Jesus Christ the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.600" end="00:03:38.950" style="s2">brotherhood of man and forgiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.970" end="00:03:41.049" style="s2">tolerance and understanding and love and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.950" end="00:03:43.420" style="s2">all of that absolutely all on board with</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.049" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2">that he was by no means the first person</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.420" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">to preach that kind of thing but the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.180" end="00:03:54.100" style="s2">mythology that underlies it and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:56.590" style="s2">separation of God from man from nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.100" end="00:03:59.320" style="s2">and again I&#39;m quite willing to accept</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.590" end="00:04:00.820" style="s2">that there is a deficiency in my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.320" end="00:04:04.420" style="s2">understanding of Christianity like I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.820" end="00:04:06.010" style="s2">said I am no scholar but that that does</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.420" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">seem to me to be and I&#39;m not the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.010" end="00:04:13.769" style="s2">one to think this as Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.769" style="s2">Oh God his name escapes me</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.650" end="00:04:21.100" style="s2">begins with the see I can&#39;t think of his</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.780" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">name it&#39;ll come to me anyway talks about</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.100" end="00:04:25.389" style="s2">this also about this failing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:27.940" style="s2">Christianity that it fails to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.389" end="00:04:30.850" style="s2">the divine in all things you know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.940" end="00:04:35.470" style="s2">all things have a soul all beings have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.850" end="00:04:39.070" style="s2">soul is not unique to man and this sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.470" end="00:04:42.340" style="s2">of superiority that man has and that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.070" end="00:04:45.610" style="s2">has the right to impose his will through</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.340" end="00:04:48.760" style="s2">force over nature in order to make life</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.610" end="00:04:50.770" style="s2">better for him alright I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:52.870" style="s2">you know because it encourages - it</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.770" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">encourages us to see the world a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.870" end="00:04:58.810" style="s2">of stuff out there that we can use any</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:00.910" style="s2">way that we like and that seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.810" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">be right at the heart of how we are able</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.910" end="00:05:05.320" style="s2">to treat the world as we do and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:07.419" style="s2">talking about climate change just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.320" end="00:05:10.270" style="s2">mr. Peterson I have deep suspicions</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.419" end="00:05:12.669" style="s2">about the climate change narrative which</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.270" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">is being forced down my throat just for</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.669" end="00:05:15.639" style="s2">the very simple reason that it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">forced down my throat that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.639" end="00:05:19.660" style="s2">extremely suspicious but there is no</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">doubt that the amount of plastic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.660" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">throwing into the ground into the ends</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">of the water the toxification of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:29.650" style="s2">freshwater supplies the stripping the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:31.240" style="s2">forests the d the you know the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.650" end="00:05:33.880" style="s2">soil as a consequence of deforestation</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.240" end="00:05:35.139" style="s2">the chemical runoff the blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.880" end="00:05:37.539" style="s2">means that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.139" end="00:05:39.820" style="s2">things all of which need urgent</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.539" end="00:05:41.950" style="s2">attention you know species die-off there</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.820" end="00:05:43.870" style="s2">are many many things all of which need</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.950" end="00:05:45.970" style="s2">urgent attention and for me the climate</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.870" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">change narrative is once again a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.970" end="00:05:50.110" style="s2">distraction from doing anything about</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:52.389" style="s2">all of these things which actually there</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:54.370" style="s2">are ready available solutions to instead</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.389" end="00:05:55.930" style="s2">we&#39;re too busy squabbling about who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.370" end="00:06:00.940" style="s2">right over climate change but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.930" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">that to one side that narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.940" end="00:06:06.520" style="s2">again for the two mr. Peterson thank you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:09.220" style="s2">for integrate</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.520" end="00:06:12.490" style="s2">on earth no it&#39;s not Conrad anyway thank</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.220" end="00:06:17.320" style="s2">you again for introducing me to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.490" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">of the power of story to shape not only</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.320" end="00:06:24.289" style="s2">our reality but the way that we function</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:28.620" style="s2">in the world and but I but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.289" end="00:06:31.289" style="s2">adhering to and internalizing flawed</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.620" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">stories is extremely dangerous and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.289" end="00:06:38.310" style="s2">for me the judeo-christian narrative of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">God man nature is is is deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.310" end="00:06:43.830" style="s2">fought it encourages us to exploit and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:47.940" style="s2">destroy the world around us and not to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.830" end="00:06:50.220" style="s2">honor cherish worship it in every action</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.940" end="00:06:52.380" style="s2">that in every action interaction that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.220" end="00:06:54.210" style="s2">take with it there is no way if we saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.380" end="00:06:56.250" style="s2">every being as having a soul very much</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.210" end="00:06:57.990" style="s2">like our own that we would treat our</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.250" end="00:07:00.120" style="s2">livestock the way that we do for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.990" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">you know we love our pets and yet we go</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.120" end="00:07:03.930" style="s2">down and we buy steaks anyway again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:07.830" style="s2">not really a thing I want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.930" end="00:07:09.240" style="s2">but but I hope I&#39;ve made my point but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.830" end="00:07:11.009" style="s2">was Joseph Campbell I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.240" end="00:07:12.770" style="s2">not Joseph Conrad he wrote part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.009" end="00:07:18.539" style="s2">darkness of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.770" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">Joseph Campbell was also very intimately</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.539" end="00:07:23.070" style="s2">on his whole life exploring mythology</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:27.090" style="s2">from all over the world in particular</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.340" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">was informed by Jung&#39;s work as is Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.190" end="00:07:46.919" style="s2">Peterson so one of the points that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">Campbell makes is that when things are</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.919" end="00:07:50.970" style="s2">changing very rapidly it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.009" style="s2">for new mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.970" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">to emerge because it obviously takes</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.009" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">time for them to find expression and you</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:04.530" style="s2">back in the 60s 70s but the saying is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.550" end="00:08:05.970" style="s2">absolutely true today even more so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.530" end="00:08:08.250" style="s2">things are changing so quickly that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.970" end="00:08:12.150" style="s2">that it&#39;s all but impossible for new</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.250" end="00:08:14.820" style="s2">myths new stories to develop but I guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.150" end="00:08:18.570" style="s2">if there is an overarching point to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.820" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">video then it would be a plea for people</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.570" end="00:08:24.360" style="s2">to try and let will make room for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:25.450" style="s2">possibility of new stories in their</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.360" end="00:08:28.180" style="s2">minds and in their</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.450" end="00:08:30.510" style="s2">because the ones that we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.180" end="00:08:33.520" style="s2">our stories of money are stories of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.510" end="00:08:40.600" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition our stories of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.520" end="00:08:42.610" style="s2">power and so on are all rooted in what</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.600" end="00:08:45.430" style="s2">Charles Eisenstein refers to as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.610" end="00:08:47.020" style="s2">story of separation where you know as</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.960" style="s2">is which is for us to use and where</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:54.550" style="s2">we&#39;re not in any way personally</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.960" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">connected with it in our stories don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.550" end="00:08:58.690" style="s2">allow us to be you know we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:00.250" style="s2">everything in physical terms that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.690" end="00:09:03.780" style="s2">ourselves our awareness our</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.250" end="00:09:06.280" style="s2">consciousness is nothing more than the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.780" end="00:09:09.130" style="s2">consequence of chemical reactions taking</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.280" end="00:09:11.460" style="s2">place atoms and electrons and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.130" end="00:09:15.520" style="s2">waves of energy moving according to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.460" end="00:09:18.100" style="s2">deterministic laws and I mean I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.520" end="00:09:19.420" style="s2">prove it otherwise but my own experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.100" end="00:09:20.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like that nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.420" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">experience feels like that and so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.980" end="00:09:24.820" style="s2">know if it looks like a dark and smells</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:27.520" style="s2">like a duck it&#39;s a duck or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.820" end="00:09:31.150" style="s2">phrase is is something like that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.520" end="00:09:35.400" style="s2">escapes me exactly where it is so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.150" end="00:09:37.810" style="s2">we really need to start coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.400" end="00:09:43.770" style="s2">circulating reinforcing telling</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.810" end="00:09:47.880" style="s2">ourselves new kinds of stories where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.770" end="00:09:50.680" style="s2">underlying substrate is one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.880" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2">connectedness and not of separation</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.680" end="00:09:54.400" style="s2">because however much you deny the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:56.050" style="s2">reality of the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.400" end="00:09:57.280" style="s2">connected to everything around us</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.050" end="00:10:00.400" style="s2">everything around us if you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.280" end="00:10:01.660" style="s2">part of it and it&#39;s part of us even if</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.400" end="00:10:02.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t believe that it doesn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.660" end="00:10:04.650" style="s2">it being true it doesn&#39;t stop the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.920" end="00:10:07.510" style="s2">consequences of our actions being</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.650" end="00:10:10.920" style="s2">devastating ultimately to ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.510" end="00:10:13.720" style="s2">so you know if for nothing other than</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.920" end="00:10:15.490" style="s2">self-interest we really need to start</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.720" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">developing some new stories anyway I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.490" end="00:10:19.540" style="s2">starting to repeat myself so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:21.880" style="s2">very much for those of you that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.540" end="00:10:23.110" style="s2">watching for watching and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.880" end="00:10:25.030" style="s2">I&#39;m saying interesting things then</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.110" end="00:10:26.920" style="s2">please spread the word I guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.030" end="00:10:29.140" style="s2">ultimately what I&#39;m hoping is that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.920" end="00:10:32.080" style="s2">gets back to Jordan Peters him himself</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.140" end="00:10:34.210" style="s2">at Jordan Peters and himself and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.080" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">know that he thinks from worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.210" end="00:10:38.080" style="s2">consideration and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:40.180" style="s2">most of them in some way but you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.080" end="00:10:42.339" style="s2">that&#39;s unlikely who the am i 42</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.180" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">subscribers right so anyway thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.339" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">very much for watching I&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">something else soon</p>
