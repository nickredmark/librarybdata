<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">and the main what what the main point is</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:12.330" style="s2">that you try to communicate to your</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:15.570" style="s2">students and main learning experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.330" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">well the the components of the Masters</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.570" end="00:00:19.350" style="s2">and mystics hands well one way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:22.170" style="s2">looking after the many ways of asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.350" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">that question isn&#39;t one answer basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.170" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">but one answer one once it might be that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:31.859" style="s2">it&#39;s to do with an approach to the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:33.739" style="s2">that is not just about thinking but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">name incorporates thinking into</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.739" end="00:00:40.190" style="s2">intuition our sensory experience and our</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">an ethical response to the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.190" end="00:00:45.690" style="s2">or if you put differently it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">science where you recognizes that ethics</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.690" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">is built into the very structure of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">nature and it&#39;s not as if nature is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">dead mechanical backdrop that we thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">it was up until the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">20th century in science so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">it has an ethics deep within it which</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">can communicate itself to us in other</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">words that nature is actually sentient</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">and that we are able to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">participate with this sentence in nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">through our thinking amounts through our</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">intellects which we mustn&#39;t reject but</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.720" style="s2">just as much and just as importantly</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:23.820" style="s2">through our ethics our feeling that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.720" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">through our sensory experience and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">through our intuition so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">combination list excite is a combination</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">of using those four ways of million</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">ourselves in developing and participate</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">or relationship with the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:45.979" style="s2">in in your recent book the animal earth</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">and you try the scientific information</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.979" end="00:01:52.530" style="s2">of Gaia theory in with aspects of Deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:55.170" style="s2">Ecology and also of Jungian psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.530" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">could you and say a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.170" end="00:01:59.490" style="s2">that yeah how you see them connect mmm</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">well it&#39;s again using that fourfold</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.490" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">model which I outlined just now which</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">comes from you thinking feeling sensing</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:08.649" style="s2">and intuition and in science we just use</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:10.090" style="s2">thinking convened</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.649" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">science we just use thinking and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.090" end="00:02:14.290" style="s2">it the others are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:16.860" style="s2">disregarded or their faintly</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.290" end="00:02:19.330" style="s2">acknowledged if at all but in that book</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.860" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">what I try to do is take the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.330" end="00:02:27.819" style="s2">information and real and solid literally</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">reanimated brings soul back in to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.819" end="00:02:31.959" style="s2">scientific descriptions of violent</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:35.560" style="s2">cycles such as the carbon cycle or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.959" end="00:02:38.349" style="s2">sulfur cycle by speaking of the actors</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.560" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">in the feedback loops as personalities</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.349" end="00:02:44.470" style="s2">not not as if they were personalities</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:47.049" style="s2">but actually as persons in some broader</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.470" end="00:02:49.690" style="s2">sense of what we mean by person as</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.049" end="00:02:52.209" style="s2">sentient creatures that are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.690" end="00:02:54.519" style="s2">experience so carbon atoms have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.209" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">personality oxygen atoms have</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.519" end="00:03:00.909" style="s2">personalities the great ecosystems have</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:03.129" style="s2">personality their qualities so I try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.909" end="00:03:06.670" style="s2">describe some of the standard scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.129" end="00:03:11.379" style="s2">accounts of guy and fleabag loose from</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.670" end="00:03:14.079" style="s2">that perspective in where do you see the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.379" end="00:03:16.510" style="s2">enrichment and in when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.079" end="00:03:18.609" style="s2">speak about nature in that way well what</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.510" end="00:03:20.769" style="s2">does it do to people and to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.609" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">understanding well is it it can develop</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.769" end="00:03:25.180" style="s2">a very strong sense of participation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:27.669" style="s2">it&#39;s realistic in the sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.180" end="00:03:29.859" style="s2">doesn&#39;t reject any way of knowing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.669" end="00:03:31.480" style="s2">the tendency either is either to could</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.859" end="00:03:33.790" style="s2">stay with irrational completely and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.480" end="00:03:35.620" style="s2">reject the others this gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.790" end="00:03:37.299" style="s2">partial understanding or to go with</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.620" end="00:03:38.829" style="s2">feeling or intuition or sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.299" end="00:03:42.099" style="s2">reject the intellect which gives you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.829" end="00:03:43.810" style="s2">another partial understanding what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.099" end="00:03:45.730" style="s2">trying to do here is bring those two</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.810" end="00:03:48.129" style="s2">sides together the quantities and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.730" end="00:03:50.199" style="s2">qualities the facts and the values the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.129" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">culture and nature these dichotomies we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.199" end="00:03:53.620" style="s2">have created in our culture since the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:57.489" style="s2">Scientific Revolution to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.620" end="00:03:58.780" style="s2">together and I find that when we work</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.489" end="00:04:01.750" style="s2">like this with students who are studying</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.780" end="00:04:03.849" style="s2">Gaia or science generally a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.750" end="00:04:06.220" style="s2">sense of participation in the world can</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.849" end="00:04:09.579" style="s2">happen in fact one way I put it is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.220" end="00:04:11.829" style="s2">students or people can be guided by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.579" end="00:04:14.109" style="s2">very personality of the earth so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.829" end="00:04:17.950" style="s2">not as if as if the earth is alive not</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.109" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">as if the earth in this this understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.950" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">she is alive and actually is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:28.210" style="s2">psychological presence actually does</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:30.190" style="s2">have a soul and this unsold quality of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.210" end="00:04:31.780" style="s2">the earth is agents in the earth can</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.190" end="00:04:33.610" style="s2">sweep through your consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.780" end="00:04:37.090" style="s2">open it up and broaden it out and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.610" end="00:04:40.300" style="s2">inspire it and embed you deeply within</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:41.650" style="s2">itself and I think this is what we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.300" end="00:04:44.290" style="s2">to discover if we&#39;re going to move</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.650" end="00:04:47.530" style="s2">towards genuine sustainability otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.290" end="00:04:48.760" style="s2">our efforts to become sustainable won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.530" end="00:04:50.680" style="s2">work because they&#39;ll be founded on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:52.360" style="s2">wrong perspective and of course this</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:04:55.630" style="s2">perspective around talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.360" end="00:04:57.940" style="s2">nothing new it goes way back into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.630" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">roots of our own culture and we see it</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.940" end="00:05:02.140" style="s2">in I think I could say or tribal</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">additional traditional indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.140" end="00:05:07.030" style="s2">cultures this notion of the earth or</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:08.770" style="s2">home of nature is an animal being is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.030" end="00:05:11.050" style="s2">really a primordial way of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.770" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">world which I think we in our company to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.050" end="00:05:18.100" style="s2">rediscover and we are part of that being</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:20.980" style="s2">completely behind it you know so how</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.100" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">does our psychology relate to they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.980" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">also been quite strongly influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:30.070" style="s2">Anna Nessun and the deep ecologist and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:33.870" style="s2">where do you see the link to to your</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.070" end="00:05:36.340" style="s2">work now from that influence and mmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.870" end="00:05:39.220" style="s2">well Deep Ecology I think is about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.340" end="00:05:40.840" style="s2">experience fundamentally about a deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.220" end="00:05:42.670" style="s2">experience of the centres of the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.840" end="00:05:45.580" style="s2">because how I would put it is not how I</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.670" end="00:05:47.500" style="s2">mean s to put it but it&#39;s how it is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.580" end="00:05:50.290" style="s2">ecology is about a deep experience of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.500" end="00:05:51.700" style="s2">the center of nature of the world so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.290" end="00:05:54.220" style="s2">honey nests would say things like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.700" end="00:05:58.270" style="s2">not going to the mountains I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.220" end="00:06:01.630" style="s2">be with the mountains so he would go to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.270" end="00:06:04.360" style="s2">his mountain hut and in Norway and just</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.630" end="00:06:07.450" style="s2">be with the mountains by that he means</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">he would speak absorb the wisdom of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.450" end="00:06:12.690" style="s2">mountain singers be taught by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:17.050" style="s2">mountains this is a deep experience of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.690" end="00:06:19.060" style="s2">deep connectedness and then in deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.050" end="00:06:22.360" style="s2">ecology we go further than that we then</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.060" end="00:06:25.300" style="s2">say okay how can we live our lives in</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.360" end="00:06:26.860" style="s2">accordance with that deep experience and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.300" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">then the more rational aspect comes in</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.860" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">and we begin to deeply question our</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:33.490" style="s2">lifestyles in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:37.449" style="s2">relation to that deep experience and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.490" end="00:06:39.909" style="s2">then we act having deeply questioned how</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.449" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">we&#39;re living with an act and it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.909" end="00:06:43.090" style="s2">a kind of hermeneutic circle these three</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:46.110" style="s2">things are connected with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.090" end="00:06:49.900" style="s2">you get a increasing depth of experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.110" end="00:06:51.580" style="s2">of questioning and commitment and so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.900" end="00:06:54.099" style="s2">work with an ammeter that I was doing in</p>
