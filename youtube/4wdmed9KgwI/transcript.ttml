<p begin="00:00:02.100" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">this episode I will be trying to take a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.450" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">an extension on the medium post called</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">understanding the blue church so this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:19.680" style="s2">an effort to see if the visual medium</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">can help extend or enhance that</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.680" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">particular medium post I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:27.390" style="s2">know whether or not it would be more</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:29.490" style="s2">beneficial for someone to have read that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.390" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">first to watch this and agreed it or</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.490" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">community watch this or possible to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">engaged in either so here&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:40.649" style="s2">proposition when I when I used the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">phrase or the concepts the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.649" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a handful of distinctions that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">feel are important to make first that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">noticed the lack of them I think seem to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">leave some people confused so first and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">foremost I am not in any normal sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">talking about anything like a church</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re not talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">Catholic Church or the Episcopalian</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">Church or big buildings with crosses on</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">top and whatnot and it is a metaphor and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a useful metaphor because</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:16.850" style="s2">there are church things involved with</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">this this object the blue church a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.850" end="00:01:23.820" style="s2">second while while it is the case that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:26.810" style="s2">you can identify certain actual things</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">like say Harvard or the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.810" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">that are part of something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">called the blue church I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">actually much more interesting important</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">and useful to perceive this thing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">thing I&#39;m calling the blue church from</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">the perspective of an abstraction from</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:50.790" style="s2">the perspective of a fundamental way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">going about doing certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.790" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">things in social space that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">developed in a certain time frame that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:00.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk about in a moment under</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">certain conditions and that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.810" end="00:02:07.079" style="s2">have been embodied in certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:10.770" style="s2">institutions that we can physically</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.079" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">touch or at least talk about but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.770" end="00:02:14.610" style="s2">not actually the key so for example I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">would say that there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.610" end="00:02:20.520" style="s2">some variant on the blue church in most</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:22.739" style="s2">of the Western civilization&#39;s and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.520" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">are different institutional structures</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.739" end="00:02:25.530" style="s2">and in fact behave differently because</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:27.660" style="s2">they have different paths dependency on</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.530" end="00:02:29.610" style="s2">how they got here so the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.660" end="00:02:33.569" style="s2">distinction is to try to separate the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.610" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">the things that we are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.569" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">from what I think is the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">fundamental characteristics of how this</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.800" end="00:02:44.040" style="s2">particular process came to be and how it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:46.920" style="s2">operates and then the third is to make a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.040" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">distinction between the form the blue</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:55.019" style="s2">church and the content what I called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">blue faith now again it is the case that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.019" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">there is a linkage which is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:00.810" style="s2">useful to even talk about them both as</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">being blue between the blue faith and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.810" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">the blue Church and the color blue</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:08.340" style="s2">because both are broadly right now in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:11.880" style="s2">the United States associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:14.190" style="s2">left and with the Democratic Party but</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.880" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">all of those Canon and should be also</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.190" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">decomposed and separated so isolating</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">the blue faith from the blue church I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">think is useful and helpful and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually spent an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">amount of time digging into the specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">characteristics of the blue faith and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:32.819" style="s2">how it came to be I could sort of broad</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.900" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2">brush say that it seems to be showing up</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.819" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">as the consequence of the long</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:40.769" style="s2">development of a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:44.100" style="s2">things that were more or less kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.769" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">categorized as the new left back for six</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.100" end="00:03:49.260" style="s2">decades ago and how they come to show up</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:50.880" style="s2">now but you know that&#39;s a broad brush</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.260" end="00:03:54.389" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.880" end="00:03:56.459" style="s2">about the form the blue church itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.389" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">okay so given that let me let me go</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.459" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">deeper what would I mean the the the big</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:09.079" style="s2">picture concept is to say that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:13.829" style="s2">society which is to say in human</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.079" end="00:04:17.700" style="s2">structures that are much larger than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.829" end="00:04:22.200" style="s2">kinds of Aboriginal social arrangements</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.700" end="00:04:23.400" style="s2">that we developed in you know millions</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.200" end="00:04:25.800" style="s2">of years ago hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.400" end="00:04:28.110" style="s2">years ago in the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.800" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">emerged at scale after</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.110" end="00:04:33.229" style="s2">the development of agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">civilization so societies in societies</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.229" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">we need some way to go about getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:43.169" style="s2">this mass of people to coordinate to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:45.599" style="s2">on the same page to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.169" end="00:04:47.939" style="s2">choices together and to undertake</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.599" end="00:04:50.699" style="s2">actions in a coordinated fashion and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.939" end="00:04:52.289" style="s2">that this way I&#39;m going to call this a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.699" end="00:04:54.689" style="s2">social control structure and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.289" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">mean anything particularly malevolent</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.689" end="00:04:57.419" style="s2">about that I don&#39;t mean control in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:04:59.699" style="s2">sense necessarily of tyranny although it</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.419" end="00:05:01.259" style="s2">certainly can be tyrannical but more in</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.699" end="00:05:03.300" style="s2">the cybernetic sense or even in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.259" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">steam engine sense and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.300" end="00:05:09.539" style="s2">necessary mechanism to get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:12.840" style="s2">disparate kinds of elements to work</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.539" end="00:05:16.590" style="s2">together well and that these social</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.840" end="00:05:19.020" style="s2">control structures evolve or develop</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.590" end="00:05:25.169" style="s2">under certain kinds of social conditions</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.020" end="00:05:28.830" style="s2">so for example the Victorian era social</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.169" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">control structure grew up in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.830" end="00:05:32.759" style="s2">of the nineteenth century under the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.650" style="s2">context of the significant increase in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.759" end="00:05:36.839" style="s2">population that had been delivered by</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.650" end="00:05:40.469" style="s2">the that particular agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.839" end="00:05:42.710" style="s2">revolution but the new urbanization by</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.469" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">the emergence of industrial technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.710" end="00:05:47.669" style="s2">and by the changes in human mobilization</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2">that were brought about by the railroad</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.669" end="00:05:51.599" style="s2">and by the early emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:52.830" style="s2">Telegraph which changed the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.599" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">could communicate and of course even the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.830" end="00:05:55.409" style="s2">newspaper which also changed the way we</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">communicate so these are all</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.409" end="00:05:58.469" style="s2">characteristics of the social</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:00.539" style="s2">environment that gave rise to certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.469" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">possibilities and certain necessities</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.539" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">that any social control structure would</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:11.610" style="s2">have to deal with and over time as</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:14.539" style="s2">certain experiments were tried and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.610" end="00:06:16.379" style="s2">different approaches were endeavoured a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.539" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">particular collection that I would call</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.379" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">the the Victorian era structure came</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:24.180" style="s2">into being and it worked for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:27.449" style="s2">then in the early part of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.180" end="00:06:30.029" style="s2">century the situation had changed and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.449" end="00:06:32.819" style="s2">that particular control structure broke</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.029" end="00:06:35.610" style="s2">down and we saw in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.819" end="00:06:38.130" style="s2">20th century the emergence of a new</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.610" end="00:06:41.069" style="s2">social control structure and that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.130" end="00:06:42.150" style="s2">what I&#39;m calling the blue church so here</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.069" end="00:06:43.710" style="s2">we saw again</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.150" end="00:06:47.720" style="s2">to change across the entire social field</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.710" end="00:06:49.830" style="s2">again a massive increase in population a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.720" end="00:06:53.600" style="s2">significant shift in the way that people</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.830" end="00:06:56.940" style="s2">lived the suburban diaspora for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.600" end="00:07:00.150" style="s2">massive changes in transportation the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.940" end="00:07:02.670" style="s2">ability to travel by aircraft or car</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.150" end="00:07:06.390" style="s2">really changed the cosmopolitanism of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.670" end="00:07:08.280" style="s2">individual human beings and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.390" end="00:07:11.780" style="s2">massification of both production</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.280" end="00:07:16.050" style="s2">processes and I think most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.780" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">Communications so the emergence of mass</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:23.430" style="s2">media most notably television and so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:25.260" style="s2">might say that the blue church is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.430" end="00:07:27.300" style="s2">consequence of what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.260" end="00:07:28.890" style="s2">endeavor to generate a social control</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.300" end="00:07:30.360" style="s2">structure in that context and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.890" end="00:07:32.820" style="s2">specifically we might say that the blue</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.360" end="00:07:34.290" style="s2">church is how one goes about doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.820" end="00:07:36.750" style="s2">social control in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.290" end="00:07:38.010" style="s2">broadcast so now I&#39;m making a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.750" end="00:07:42.510" style="s2">shift and I&#39;m focusing on what I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.010" end="00:07:45.200" style="s2">is the main point the blue church is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.510" end="00:07:47.760" style="s2">quite characteristically broadcast and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.200" end="00:07:49.560" style="s2">you might even say the broadcast will</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.760" end="00:07:52.320" style="s2">tend to show up as something like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.560" end="00:07:55.730" style="s2">blue church so what does that mean so</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.320" end="00:07:59.040" style="s2">first broadcast is a mode of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.730" end="00:08:02.610" style="s2">communication where you have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.040" end="00:08:04.920" style="s2">asymmetry between the signaler the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:06.870" style="s2">communicator the expressor and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.920" end="00:08:08.880" style="s2">audience meaning both that there may be</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.870" end="00:08:11.190" style="s2">a small number of signalers like say one</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.880" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">and a potentially very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.190" end="00:08:16.890" style="s2">audience maybe everyone you think radio</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.610" end="00:08:20.070" style="s2">or television where one television show</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.890" end="00:08:22.500" style="s2">like say the Super Bowl might have</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.070" end="00:08:23.610" style="s2">hundreds of millions of viewers and only</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.500" end="00:08:25.950" style="s2">a very small number people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.610" end="00:08:30.660" style="s2">actually in charge of what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.950" end="00:08:32.280" style="s2">broadcast it also has a singular</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">direction which is that the signal goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.280" end="00:08:36.870" style="s2">from the signal or to the receiver and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:40.920" style="s2">there&#39;s very very little going back it</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.870" end="00:08:42.630" style="s2">was largely one-way so the mental image</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.920" end="00:08:46.650" style="s2">of broadcast television works and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.630" end="00:08:48.300" style="s2">important but it&#39;s not exclusive you</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.650" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">know if you take a look at for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.300" end="00:08:52.650" style="s2">the way that the education system at</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:54.600" style="s2">least in United States shows up in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.650" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">same time frame it is also a broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.600" end="00:08:56.860" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.529" style="s2">a professor who sits at the front</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.860" end="00:09:01.029" style="s2">there&#39;s only one or maybe two there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.529" end="00:09:03.550" style="s2">some large number of students and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.029" end="00:09:04.779" style="s2">professor is in charge of speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.550" end="00:09:06.430" style="s2">the students are responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.779" end="00:09:08.490" style="s2">listening and there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.430" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">back-channel and so still a broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.490" end="00:09:13.300" style="s2">typology and the proposition that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.790" style="s2">making is that this this nature of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.300" end="00:09:17.740" style="s2">broadcast typology one is characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.790" end="00:09:19.390" style="s2">up and down across the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.740" end="00:09:23.580" style="s2">therefore it becomes one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.390" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">characteristics to look at and to has</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.580" end="00:09:28.660" style="s2">implications it has implications in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:31.870" style="s2">terms of what kinds of things are said</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.660" end="00:09:33.730" style="s2">how power shows up and plays with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.870" end="00:09:36.930" style="s2">constraints of how broadcast operates</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.730" end="00:09:38.970" style="s2">and also in terms of what the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.930" end="00:09:41.350" style="s2">consciousness and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.970" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">characteristics of human beings are that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.350" end="00:09:46.029" style="s2">happen to develop in this environment so</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:49.510" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to that actually in a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.029" end="00:09:51.940" style="s2">bit and remember this is not a effort to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.510" end="00:09:53.560" style="s2">disparage either broadcast or the blue</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.940" end="00:09:54.670" style="s2">church is a diagnosis to describe</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.560" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">something that seems to have simply been</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.670" end="00:10:01.150" style="s2">the case a phenomenon and in fact it it</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">worked really well right we take a look</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.150" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">at the at the scope of what civilization</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:06.790" style="s2">was able to accomplish in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:09.370" style="s2">century it was broadly astoundingly</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.790" end="00:10:10.690" style="s2">awesome the growth the well-being of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.370" end="00:10:13.180" style="s2">human beings went up enormous lead</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.690" end="00:10:14.470" style="s2">across the board in almost every</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.180" end="00:10:17.970" style="s2">location of there all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.470" end="00:10:17.970" style="s2">travesties as well for sure but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.810" end="00:10:24.820" style="s2">just part of what happened but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.020" end="00:10:27.880" style="s2">things like being able to go to the moon</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.820" end="00:10:29.260" style="s2">or build health care systems that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.880" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">radically improves the quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.260" end="00:10:35.380" style="s2">were the the Agricultural Revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:37.000" style="s2">that century we&#39;re all part and parcel</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.380" end="00:10:41.080" style="s2">the kinds of things the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.000" end="00:10:43.240" style="s2">could do and it did this by generating a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.080" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">certain topology so now we&#39;re into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.240" end="00:10:50.010" style="s2">second major point the the topology of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:52.390" style="s2">the blue church seems to be defined by</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.010" end="00:10:56.380" style="s2">two major characteristics one</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.390" end="00:10:59.529" style="s2">characteristic is its organization into</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.380" end="00:11:01.209" style="s2">a hierarchy as all broadcasts or want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.529" end="00:11:02.650" style="s2">be even if it&#39;s just a two layer</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.209" end="00:11:04.360" style="s2">hierarchy the broadcaster and the signal</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.650" end="00:11:05.740" style="s2">but in this case it&#39;s a multi layer</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.360" end="00:11:08.440" style="s2">hierarchy and it&#39;s a hierarchy the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.740" end="00:11:10.470" style="s2">vertical direction you could say</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.440" end="00:11:14.230" style="s2">is a hierarchy of expertise or of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.470" end="00:11:15.970" style="s2">legitimate and/or credible Authority so</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.230" end="00:11:18.850" style="s2">when it works well the way the blue</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.970" end="00:11:22.120" style="s2">church operates is that in endeavors to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">put into place various meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.120" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">filtering mechanisms to identify</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:29.500" style="s2">individuals and groups of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:31.540" style="s2">who have the capacity for or have</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.500" end="00:11:34.270" style="s2">achieved a particular domain expertise</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.540" end="00:11:36.540" style="s2">puts them in charge of figuring stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.270" end="00:11:40.960" style="s2">out to of making sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.540" end="00:11:44.020" style="s2">then of expressing that sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.960" end="00:11:45.460" style="s2">broadcast channels and so you would like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.020" end="00:11:48.100" style="s2">to have the people who know what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.460" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">on being the ones who evaluate what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.100" end="00:11:51.580" style="s2">happening and then sharing that with</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:53.590" style="s2">everybody else and that&#39;s more or less</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.580" end="00:11:55.690" style="s2">the design Early&#39;s that&#39;s the design</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.590" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2">intent and it kind of works well in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.690" end="00:12:03.640" style="s2">certain circumstances and under certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.920" end="00:12:05.170" style="s2">constraints of course it has a number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.640" end="00:12:07.240" style="s2">relatively obvious failure conditions</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.170" end="00:12:10.120" style="s2">that will always show up in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.240" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">asymmetric hierarchy so it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.120" end="00:12:14.170" style="s2">that if you want to control something</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:15.520" style="s2">what you do is you find out the control</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.170" end="00:12:17.560" style="s2">system and if that control system</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.520" end="00:12:20.110" style="s2">happens to have a directionality to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.560" end="00:12:21.280" style="s2">way that information flows and it tends</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.110" end="00:12:22.330" style="s2">to have a hierarchy then what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.280" end="00:12:24.550" style="s2">find a way to get to the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.330" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">hierarchy effectively created a really</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.550" end="00:12:27.910" style="s2">high quality niche and is there any</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:30.700" style="s2">evolutionary theorists who tell you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.910" end="00:12:32.170" style="s2">every nation is going to be filled and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.700" end="00:12:33.640" style="s2">of course that sort of thing has</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.170" end="00:12:36.700" style="s2">happened and will continue to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.640" end="00:12:39.250" style="s2">anything that looks like that now if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.700" end="00:12:40.750" style="s2">go in the downward direction you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.250" end="00:12:42.730" style="s2">different set of characteristics so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.750" end="00:12:45.070" style="s2">expertise and legitimate Authority on</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.730" end="00:12:48.280" style="s2">what happened all the way up on the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.070" end="00:12:52.450" style="s2">down what you have is the ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.280" end="00:12:55.030" style="s2">good at receiving and acting on</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.450" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2">quote/unquote good opinion so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.030" end="00:13:01.210" style="s2">here is think about the student the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:03.400" style="s2">professor expresses what is to be the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.210" end="00:13:06.339" style="s2">case the the lesson the students job is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.400" end="00:13:07.930" style="s2">to listen to understand to map the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.339" end="00:13:10.900" style="s2">meaningful components of the lesson and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.930" end="00:13:14.110" style="s2">then to be able to respond effectively</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.900" end="00:13:15.580" style="s2">to queries the content that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.110" end="00:13:17.410" style="s2">lesson so if you things like a math</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.580" end="00:13:19.030" style="s2">class if the teacher says two plus two</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.410" end="00:13:20.440" style="s2">equals four the students job is to hear</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.030" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">what is two plus two and respond with</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.440" end="00:13:23.709" style="s2">four so this is good opinion</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:25.480" style="s2">and we can say by the way that this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.709" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">characteristic of the totality of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.480" end="00:13:29.560" style="s2">content this is part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:32.170" style="s2">the blue church is an effective control</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.560" end="00:13:34.209" style="s2">structure you know it&#39;s very if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.170" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">imagined every single human being had</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.209" end="00:13:39.670" style="s2">their own bespoke interpretation of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:42.490" style="s2">to drive and what various kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.500" end="00:13:48.250" style="s2">and necessary for us all to be on the</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.250" end="00:13:50.980" style="s2">certain signals so that we can</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.980" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea so within a certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.339" end="00:13:59.290" style="s2">boundary conditions the idea is the blue</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:00.459" style="s2">church enables us to have people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.290" end="00:14:03.220" style="s2">spend time and effort and build</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.459" end="00:14:06.730" style="s2">capability i processing what we were</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.220" end="00:14:08.769" style="s2">perceiving in reality like say what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.769" end="00:14:12.820" style="s2">of metal and then broadcasting that down</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.740" end="00:14:14.529" style="s2">to whoever needs to receive that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.820" end="00:14:17.589" style="s2">information who then receives it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.529" end="00:14:18.970" style="s2">conveys it accurately and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.589" end="00:14:21.660" style="s2">interesting is that is the good opinion</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.970" end="00:14:25.029" style="s2">works both in relationship to up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.660" end="00:14:27.130" style="s2">side-to-side so that we can police and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.029" end="00:14:29.500" style="s2">signal each other simply which is just</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.130" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">that if I express something within the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.500" end="00:14:33.579" style="s2">boundary conditions of good opinion then</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.769" style="s2">at a minimum you can know that I&#39;m part</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.579" end="00:14:37.630" style="s2">of your structure you can you can know</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.769" end="00:14:39.430" style="s2">that I&#39;m in your group and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.630" end="00:14:40.810" style="s2">depending on the flavor of good opinion</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.430" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">that I express you can even position me</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.810" end="00:14:44.199" style="s2">and know where I am in that group and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:45.579" style="s2">can orient yourself and how to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.199" end="00:14:48.370" style="s2">me by the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.579" end="00:14:51.399" style="s2">and even how to relate to me is</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.370" end="00:14:52.870" style="s2">oftentimes the content of broadcast okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.399" end="00:14:55.589" style="s2">so if you watch for example a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.870" end="00:14:57.779" style="s2">the primary signaling organisms of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.589" end="00:15:01.480" style="s2">blue church like so the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.779" end="00:15:05.110" style="s2">most of what they are doing is orienting</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.480" end="00:15:08.529" style="s2">the audience on how to orient themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.110" end="00:15:09.730" style="s2">towards other phenomena in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.529" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">right they&#39;re not actually conveying</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.730" end="00:15:14.260" style="s2">content most of the time most of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.310" end="00:15:16.660" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is providing kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.260" end="00:15:17.889" style="s2">prefab set of evaluations of here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.660" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">the landscape looks likes and here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.889" end="00:15:21.880" style="s2">you watch respond to it so that you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:24.519" style="s2">active within the constraints of good</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.880" end="00:15:26.920" style="s2">opinion or and the most positive spin</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.519" end="00:15:28.600" style="s2">you&#39;re acting under the recommendation</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.920" end="00:15:30.490" style="s2">of wise people who&#39;ve done a good job</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.600" end="00:15:32.170" style="s2">digesting this and providing the prefab</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.490" end="00:15:35.220" style="s2">way of responding to the world I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.170" end="00:15:35.220" style="s2">obviously you one can take a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.410" end="00:15:40.329" style="s2">generous opinion of what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.979" end="00:15:41.379" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s the second major point so</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.329" end="00:15:44.439" style="s2">now we&#39;re just kind of into the last</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.379" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">part which is a very good way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.439" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">understanding what&#39;s happening now is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:51.939" style="s2">that the conditions are once again</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:54.549" style="s2">changing and I should note that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.939" end="00:15:58.059" style="s2">a singing to be an acceleration that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.549" end="00:16:00.999" style="s2">duration of the Victorian control</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.059" end="00:16:03.099" style="s2">structure was longer maybe twice as long</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.999" end="00:16:05.439" style="s2">as the duration of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.099" end="00:16:07.889" style="s2">control structure and while it&#39;s so very</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.439" end="00:16:10.779" style="s2">messy to endeavor to project that onto a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.889" end="00:16:11.829" style="s2">specific curve it nonetheless does seem</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.779" end="00:16:14.039" style="s2">to be the case that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.829" end="00:16:17.889" style="s2">consequences of the acceleration of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.039" end="00:16:20.139" style="s2">innovation is a reduction in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.889" end="00:16:22.649" style="s2">duration of these kinds of control</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.139" end="00:16:28.209" style="s2">structures so that implies two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.649" end="00:16:30.369" style="s2">one is that the if the if you say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.209" end="00:16:32.589" style="s2">the conditions upon which the blue</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.369" end="00:16:36.279" style="s2">church were was created and for which it</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.589" end="00:16:38.529" style="s2">was adapted are themselves changing then</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.279" end="00:16:41.499" style="s2">this is a lot like the changing of Anish</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.529" end="00:16:44.350" style="s2">you know if you if you see the you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.499" end="00:16:45.909" style="s2">the end of the Ice Age means the end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.350" end="00:16:48.359" style="s2">the woolly mammoth no matter how awesome</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.909" end="00:16:51.699" style="s2">the woolly mammoth was in in in the snow</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.359" end="00:16:54.909" style="s2">the the end of the broadcast age and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.699" end="00:16:57.159" style="s2">emergence of a new way of at the very</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.909" end="00:16:59.189" style="s2">least making sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.159" end="00:17:01.899" style="s2">coordinating our thoughts and actions</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.189" end="00:17:04.600" style="s2">portends the end of the blue church no</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.899" end="00:17:07.389" style="s2">matter how awesome or not awesome you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.600" end="00:17:09.159" style="s2">think it was so that&#39;s one and and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.389" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">we can also begin to do some work on</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.159" end="00:17:12.970" style="s2">understanding what might be in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:14.289" style="s2">process of emergent okay well what are</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.970" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">the characteristics the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.289" end="00:17:20.379" style="s2">environment were the things that might</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:23.470" style="s2">emerge on top of a symmetric and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.379" end="00:17:24.519" style="s2">interactive medium that&#39;s how we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.470" end="00:17:26.769" style="s2">actually be thoughtful about what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.519" end="00:17:29.049" style="s2">future might look like and then we had a</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.769" end="00:17:32.679" style="s2">centerpiece which is that hey maybe in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.049" end="00:17:33.789" style="s2">process of accelerating change might</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.679" end="00:17:35.289" style="s2">maybe be in a circumstance where</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.789" end="00:17:38.110" style="s2">whatever is in the process of emerging</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.289" end="00:17:42.009" style="s2">might actually be doomed to a rather</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.110" end="00:17:45.629" style="s2">brief appearance you know if the blue</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.009" end="00:17:49.470" style="s2">church lasted from say I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.629" end="00:17:53.620" style="s2">1940s 1950s up until</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.470" end="00:17:55.870" style="s2">2016 2010 in that range I were only</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.620" end="00:17:58.059" style="s2">talking about a 50 60 year time frame so</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.870" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">if the next thing that comes along last</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.059" end="00:18:01.540" style="s2">half as long we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:04.300" style="s2">something that in the historical record</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.540" end="00:18:05.500" style="s2">is basically just a blip so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.300" end="00:18:09.370" style="s2">interesting I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.500" end="00:18:10.870" style="s2">case but it&#39;s intriguing I noticed this</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.370" end="00:18:12.760" style="s2">is running pretty long so I&#39;ll just drop</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.870" end="00:18:14.230" style="s2">a little a coda and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.760" end="00:18:16.890" style="s2">that was also put into the tail end of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.230" end="00:18:20.650" style="s2">the video I&#39;m sorry into the medium post</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.890" end="00:18:22.290" style="s2">and that has to do with what might in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.650" end="00:18:26.050" style="s2">fact be a fundamentally problematic</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.290" end="00:18:29.590" style="s2">aspect of this entire approach to social</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.050" end="00:18:32.140" style="s2">coordination so I mentioned that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.590" end="00:18:34.620" style="s2">was a moment before these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.140" end="00:18:38.710" style="s2">social control systems the human</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.620" end="00:18:40.809" style="s2">Aboriginal tribe or band level sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.710" end="00:18:44.280" style="s2">coordination that was what we did and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.809" end="00:18:48.370" style="s2">how we operated for millions of years</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.280" end="00:18:51.700" style="s2">and now we&#39;ve been operating under a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.370" end="00:18:53.320" style="s2">different mode social control that has</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.700" end="00:18:55.510" style="s2">been figuring out how to do things and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:18:59.830" style="s2">competing with itself since you know 15</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.510" end="00:19:00.820" style="s2">thousand years ago or so now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.830" end="00:19:04.330" style="s2">actually some pretty interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.820" end="00:19:06.370" style="s2">that we can say about the the maximum</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.330" end="00:19:08.500" style="s2">bandwidth the maximum amount of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.370" end="00:19:11.140" style="s2">information processing that a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.500" end="00:19:15.010" style="s2">information processing architecture of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.140" end="00:19:17.230" style="s2">the sort that any kind of social control</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.010" end="00:19:23.559" style="s2">system must look like for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.230" end="00:19:24.730" style="s2">anything that is hierarchical at all has</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.559" end="00:19:26.140" style="s2">actually a limit on the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.730" end="00:19:28.150" style="s2">information that it can process and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.140" end="00:19:30.309" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about that is that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.150" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">may have passed that limit that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.309" end="00:19:33.790" style="s2">world that we currently live in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:36.220" style="s2">world that exists as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.790" end="00:19:40.110" style="s2">the success of the blue church may</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.220" end="00:19:42.570" style="s2">actually be more complex than any</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.110" end="00:19:46.929" style="s2">hierarchical social control system can</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.570" end="00:19:49.570" style="s2">manage at all so it&#39;s not just a matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.929" end="00:19:52.059" style="s2">that things have changed and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.570" end="00:19:53.830" style="s2">we&#39;re in store for some meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.059" end="00:19:56.970" style="s2">significant shift from the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.830" end="00:20:00.750" style="s2">model to some other kind of broadly</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.970" end="00:20:02.710" style="s2">comparable model but rather that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.750" end="00:20:05.710" style="s2">something even more fun</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.710" end="00:20:07.690" style="s2">has changed and that therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.710" end="00:20:10.390" style="s2">actually are now in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.690" end="00:20:14.460" style="s2">shifting if we make the shift at all to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.390" end="00:20:18.130" style="s2">something that is as different from</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.460" end="00:20:21.010" style="s2">civilization as civilization was from</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.130" end="00:20:24.669" style="s2">pre civilized tribal tribalism or the</p>
