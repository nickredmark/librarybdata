<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">kind of naming some kind of like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:34.430" style="s2">negative stuff that was coming up around</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:39.720" style="s2">like rebel wisdom have done this</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.430" end="00:01:41.130" style="s2">training course and they and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.720" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">getting kind of I was feeling kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.130" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">bit I&#39;ve been looking at the whole game</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">B thing for a while and I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">some feelings of like resistance to it</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">and some of it was around and the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">rebel wisdom course that they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">charging for was one of the factors that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">kind of ha was moving me and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">of into that resistance I think and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">was just asked a question on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:15.770" style="s2">Facebook group about how the well</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:18.569" style="s2">around that whether anyone else had had</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.770" end="00:02:20.250" style="s2">was feeling anything similar had felt it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.569" end="00:02:22.200" style="s2">how have they been able to transcend it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.250" end="00:02:24.240" style="s2">if if they&#39;re still in the community</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.200" end="00:02:26.069" style="s2">gone through that kind of stuff so it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.240" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">was that that was the question and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.069" end="00:02:29.730" style="s2">they load loads of stuff happened as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:30.780" style="s2">result of that and I suppose that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.730" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">kind of thing that happens on there</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.780" end="00:02:34.110" style="s2">sometimes isn&#39;t it is it just the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:37.560" style="s2">conversation goes in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:39.390" style="s2">different ways in to also yeah sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.560" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">useful sometimes not but right and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.390" end="00:02:43.739" style="s2">gets actually those it was a nice</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:47.340" style="s2">conversation yeah yeah yeah okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.739" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2">coming back to you sort of yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.340" end="00:02:54.360" style="s2">okay great cuz well where we got to and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:57.959" style="s2">that led to this was was was just around</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.360" end="00:03:00.870" style="s2">that question of money or if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.959" end="00:03:06.140" style="s2">kind of go maybe one stage above that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.870" end="00:03:11.269" style="s2">like just finding space to play game be</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.140" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">in a game in the game a world yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.269" end="00:03:16.500" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;d kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:22.799" style="s2">about and I mentioned I responded to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.500" end="00:03:25.730" style="s2">on on that about was I&#39;d said oh you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.799" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">know what about some kind of game be</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.730" end="00:03:32.700" style="s2">investment fund dedicated just for</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:35.700" style="s2">create finding some money to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">help people create space and you&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.700" end="00:03:38.220" style="s2">back and said something really</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">interesting which was you were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.220" end="00:03:46.430" style="s2">about an AI that that creates a eyes for</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">so like two steps removed a eye for</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.430" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">landing yeah so that sounded really cool</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:55.950" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear more about that like</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:04:01.290" style="s2">what&#39;s worse going on so it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.950" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">succeed that the conversation will they</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.290" end="00:04:05.900" style="s2">go back so when you begin the process of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:08.600" style="s2">starting that conversation in that group</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.900" end="00:04:11.459" style="s2">for me it&#39;s happening in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.600" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">many years of many people contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">that challenge right and different</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:18.630" style="s2">people trying different approaches yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:19.799" style="s2">until you&#39;ve actually tried something</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.630" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.799" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:34.919" style="s2">and so one of the things that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.460" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">noticed is that there appears to be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.919" end="00:04:43.860" style="s2">almost like maybe a dead end or a false</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:47.539" style="s2">a false economy right in in in in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:47.539" style="s2">particular approach which I&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.620" end="00:04:55.289" style="s2">proximal or even maybe even pseudo game</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.350" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">being so these are and the rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.289" end="00:05:01.100" style="s2">thing may actually be a lot of very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.300" end="00:05:04.680" style="s2">of that sort running and an effort that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.100" end="00:05:06.419" style="s2">is coming may be very much from a game</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.680" end="00:05:08.910" style="s2">be intent and maybe even including</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.419" end="00:05:10.889" style="s2">people who are themselves endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.910" end="00:05:12.990" style="s2">go in that direction and in many much of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.889" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">their lives are working that way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.990" end="00:05:19.169" style="s2">create a zone of cultivated security to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">get money yeah by providing a service in</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.169" end="00:05:29.220" style="s2">that vein right or even even more</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">problematically and this is the place</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.220" end="00:05:36.740" style="s2">where fails and most often is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:39.380" style="s2">do a game a thing in a game be way so</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.740" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">you know I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna run a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.380" end="00:05:44.460" style="s2">lumber company but I&#39;m gonna try to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:45.870" style="s2">it a game B Lumber Company and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.460" end="00:05:48.060" style="s2">how do I go about D now well I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.870" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2">try to you know make sure that all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.060" end="00:05:51.300" style="s2">people who work there are going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:52.740" style="s2">personal development and I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.300" end="00:05:54.900" style="s2">a wisdom counsel and you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.740" end="00:05:58.349" style="s2">happens to be right sort of hang</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.900" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">artifacts that game B or artifacts it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.349" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">almost like a Christmas tree right he</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:05.270" style="s2">wants to look over all that game be even</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:08.030" style="s2">been to today it&#39;s it&#39;s still a game a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.270" end="00:06:11.729" style="s2">activity and this actually seems to fail</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.030" end="00:06:15.780" style="s2">really badly almost all the time either</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.729" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">because the they hold the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.780" end="00:06:19.830" style="s2">the interior container so I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:22.050" style="s2">to bring anybody on board who isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.830" end="00:06:23.789" style="s2">already a full game B player which</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.050" end="00:06:26.310" style="s2">generally means you just can&#39;t move it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.789" end="00:06:27.810" style="s2">forward because there&#39;s not that many</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.310" end="00:06:28.919" style="s2">game B players since definitely that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.810" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">mean he gave me players who are also</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.919" end="00:06:35.700" style="s2">sort of skilled managers in lumber or</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.350" style="s2">the opposite which is that you begin the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.700" end="00:06:41.160" style="s2">process of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.350" end="00:06:42.660" style="s2">was I making compromises compromising</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.160" end="00:06:44.730" style="s2">the integrity of the interior which</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.660" end="00:06:46.320" style="s2">eventually very quickly will pull you on</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.730" end="00:06:48.210" style="s2">the other side of it you realize you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.320" end="00:06:49.700" style="s2">actually just more or less pretending</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.210" end="00:06:53.250" style="s2">like you&#39;re holding some small amount</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.700" end="00:06:54.570" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.250" end="00:06:56.700" style="s2">way of actually doing that same thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.570" end="00:06:59.040" style="s2">that is that it works a lot and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.700" end="00:07:01.260" style="s2">just having the notion of pardon me</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.040" end="00:07:03.090" style="s2">the zone of proximal development or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.260" end="00:07:06.030" style="s2">adjacent possible use Snowden&#39;s terms</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.090" end="00:07:07.950" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say Dave Stewart has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.030" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">very nice term which is less like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.950" end="00:07:11.910" style="s2">and more like this so it was that Dave</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:15.570" style="s2">yeah Dave snoot</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.910" end="00:07:17.640" style="s2">he&#39;s a complexity theorist right so he</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.570" end="00:07:22.350" style="s2">talks about how do you evolve system and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.640" end="00:07:23.460" style="s2">the pot and the notion is when you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.350" end="00:07:27.720" style="s2">something let&#39;s say like a Lumber</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.460" end="00:07:29.670" style="s2">Company there is always a vector whether</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.720" end="00:07:32.730" style="s2">you can take it on that is away from and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.670" end="00:07:35.070" style="s2">towards and so if you can identify what</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.730" end="00:07:38.630" style="s2">is the direction of a problem so less</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.070" end="00:07:42.690" style="s2">like clear cutting virgin forests and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.630" end="00:07:44.430" style="s2">more like producing resilience to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.690" end="00:07:45.750" style="s2">climate change by thinning out for us</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.430" end="00:07:48.330" style="s2">that otherwise which you think we would</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.750" end="00:07:49.800" style="s2">for example right and so that&#39;s a vector</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.330" end="00:07:51.420" style="s2">that said there&#39;s a space there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.800" end="00:07:53.580" style="s2">somewhere on that diamonds you can move</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.420" end="00:07:56.280" style="s2">to that is real you can actually get</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.580" end="00:07:59.970" style="s2">it&#39;s actually vital it&#39;ll be productive</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.280" end="00:08:02.130" style="s2">it&#39;ll be competitive in game a and it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.970" end="00:08:04.380" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t necessarily require that</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.130" end="00:08:06.930" style="s2">you try to hang all these accoutrements</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.380" end="00:08:09.240" style="s2">I&#39;ll call it you know the game be</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.930" end="00:08:11.340" style="s2">costume on it you can still be very</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.240" end="00:08:13.950" style="s2">straightforward game a lumber lumber</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.340" end="00:08:16.350" style="s2">experts who are doing this in a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.950" end="00:08:18.330" style="s2">more gamey way and of course the point</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.350" end="00:08:20.700" style="s2">is then you&#39;re on a movement then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.330" end="00:08:22.860" style="s2">on a path and then as that path matures</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.700" end="00:08:24.300" style="s2">you can do the same thing in your and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.860" end="00:08:25.620" style="s2">your human resources right there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.300" end="00:08:27.690" style="s2">reason why the human resources have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.620" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">be in humans right okay well how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.690" end="00:08:32.700" style="s2">think where these people are where we</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">all are in this place and and lose some</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.700" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">step some small step may be a big step</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:38.220" style="s2">is I&#39;m small step at the least in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:40.890" style="s2">positive direction don&#39;t try to move any</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.220" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">faster than you can so that&#39;s one one</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.890" end="00:08:44.730" style="s2">category and its really interesting like</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:46.350" style="s2">if you&#39;re familiar at all this is too</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.730" end="00:08:47.850" style="s2">weird thing but I&#39;m gonna deep does</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.350" end="00:08:50.150" style="s2">arleady familiarity with the history of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.850" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">the talking a district right okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.150" end="00:08:55.670" style="s2">you know you all not really but so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:57.140" style="s2">a nice illustration because they</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.670" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">actually they&#39;ve actually enumerated</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.140" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">these things they called cost of waves</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a first wave copy secondly a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:04.400" style="s2">copy and third wave copy we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.420" end="00:09:06.440" style="s2">the third wave coffee they&#39;re a copy</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.400" end="00:09:08.390" style="s2">wave yeah and there&#39;s actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.440" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">easy way but the the first way of coffee</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.390" end="00:09:16.060" style="s2">is kind of like like 50 0 like big thick</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">ceramic mugs 5 cent coffee at the diner</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.060" end="00:09:21.830" style="s2">the percolator with the with the the big</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">filter and like Folgers instant like</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.830" end="00:09:27.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the first wave copy and first</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:29.900" style="s2">wave coffee was characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.940" end="00:09:31.490" style="s2">homogenous ation but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:33.529" style="s2">differentiation that&#39;s big coffee</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.490" end="00:09:36.290" style="s2">companies like 10 big coffee companies</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.529" end="00:09:39.650" style="s2">who buy basically the least common</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.290" end="00:09:41.930" style="s2">denominator beans mostly from Colombia</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.650" end="00:09:43.910" style="s2">well modernized and burnt and roast them</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.930" end="00:09:47.089" style="s2">all in the same very dark roast and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.910" end="00:09:48.529" style="s2">shipped them up and it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.089" end="00:09:49.850" style="s2">caffeine delivery vehicle that has some</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.529" end="00:09:51.410" style="s2">flavor to it and you can put a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.850" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">stringent agreement it now is palatable</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.410" end="00:09:57.589" style="s2">yeah so then you move to the second way</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:09:58.550" style="s2">and this is Starbucks Starbucks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.589" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">really just second way which actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.550" end="00:10:02.630" style="s2">started before Starbucks</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:05.290" style="s2">well the side ways with Starbucks which</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.630" end="00:10:08.540" style="s2">was this is the local coffee shop the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.290" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a TV show called Twin Peaks that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.540" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">talked about it like oh that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:15.860" style="s2">cup of joe these are like large bold</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:18.890" style="s2">ceramic mugs the introduction to the</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:28.040" style="s2">the doll of this is that all this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.660" end="00:10:29.720" style="s2">rigmarole just used this one point and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.040" end="00:10:33.110" style="s2">the introduction of the concept of fair</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.720" end="00:10:35.570" style="s2">trade so suddenly there was like in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.110" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">zeitgeist of second wave</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.570" end="00:10:39.410" style="s2">there was an adjacent possible there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">an availability and a possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.410" end="00:10:43.790" style="s2">the part of the people who were actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:45.830" style="s2">building the industry and and the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.790" end="00:10:48.770" style="s2">actual price structure the consumers</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.830" end="00:10:51.459" style="s2">were willing to support in that model to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.770" end="00:10:54.620" style="s2">do fair trade meaning that there is a a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.459" end="00:10:55.970" style="s2">conscious effort to create direct</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.620" end="00:10:57.860" style="s2">relationships with the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.970" end="00:10:59.930" style="s2">growing the beans to a lit and able the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.860" end="00:11:02.780" style="s2">guys who in the first rave really did</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.930" end="00:11:03.670" style="s2">get completely over to have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.780" end="00:11:06.430" style="s2">bigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.670" end="00:11:08.170" style="s2">of the supply chain and Starbucks really</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.430" end="00:11:09.820" style="s2">really pioneered this in a big way much</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.170" end="00:11:11.260" style="s2">their credit but there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.820" end="00:11:13.660" style="s2">basically everybody played that so fair</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.260" end="00:11:16.570" style="s2">trade became a woven into the fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.660" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">the fo aesthetic even technological</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.570" end="00:11:21.070" style="s2">characteristics it was that was coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:23.500" style="s2">90s right because I feel like I remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.070" end="00:11:25.810" style="s2">that happening but I&#39;m yeah I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.500" end="00:11:27.550" style="s2">yes fingering the dream the dream of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.810" end="00:11:33.700" style="s2">nine users alive in second wave coffee</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.550" end="00:11:36.580" style="s2">yeah had a lot of that scene yeah by a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.700" end="00:11:38.260" style="s2">lot of that same sensibility to uh and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.580" end="00:11:40.030" style="s2">by the way is you know it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.260" end="00:11:42.490" style="s2">recognize that the price of the copy</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.030" end="00:11:44.890" style="s2">went way up my Starbucks cup of coffee</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.490" end="00:11:46.630" style="s2">got a whole lot more yeah then a cup of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.890" end="00:11:49.270" style="s2">coffee at Dunkin Donuts with the local</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.630" end="00:11:51.220" style="s2">diner so that margin structure allowed</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.270" end="00:11:52.750" style="s2">that to happen and it was nice like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.220" end="00:11:54.700" style="s2">consumers were willing to pay it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.750" end="00:11:56.860" style="s2">while Starbucks made a ton of money</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.700" end="00:11:59.460" style="s2">it actually did shifting meaning through</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.860" end="00:12:02.410" style="s2">larger fraction flow of money down to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.460" end="00:12:08.580" style="s2">the guys in Ecuador who are picking copy</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.410" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">right so then you move to a third wave</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.580" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">and the point here is like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:16.260" style="s2">less like this more like this arced it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:18.910" style="s2">been going on now for almost a century</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.260" end="00:12:22.420" style="s2">so in third wave coffee you have this</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.910" end="00:12:24.850" style="s2">movement towards local it&#39;s like a real</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.420" end="00:12:27.820" style="s2">conscious notion of these things it</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:29.350" style="s2">can&#39;t be a giant internet or net</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.820" end="00:12:31.480" style="s2">multinational corporation</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.350" end="00:12:33.340" style="s2">it can&#39;t be Starbucks has to be local</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.480" end="00:12:35.260" style="s2">like the each individual coffee shop is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.340" end="00:12:36.940" style="s2">kind of its own thing and so and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.260" end="00:12:40.030" style="s2">local needs really local so the food</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.940" end="00:12:41.890" style="s2">will tend to be brought from some local</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.030" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">vendors so I&#39;m gonna bring in all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.890" end="00:12:46.390" style="s2">fugitives we know the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">making the food and from Fairtrade to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.390" end="00:12:51.010" style="s2">direct trade meaning I had the coffee</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:52.750" style="s2">shop owner will have a direct human</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.010" end="00:12:54.370" style="s2">direct one-on-one relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.750" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">person who&#39;s at the place is growing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.370" end="00:12:57.670" style="s2">coffee and in fact part of the ethos is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:12:58.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll actually go there I&#39;ll physically</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.010" end="00:13:47.320" style="s2">almost all of those aesthetics almost</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:10.170" style="s2">of the story is a much deeper refinement</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.050" end="00:14:13.510" style="s2">in the way that the top is actually made</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.170" end="00:14:16.180" style="s2">this initiative is called a pour-over so</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.510" end="00:14:17.740" style="s2">the barrese is actually the bar for</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.250" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">of training and boom their barista and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.320" end="00:14:26.980" style="s2">third wave at least the ones that the</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.980" end="00:14:29.890" style="s2">dies of that system and they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">like international competitions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.890" end="00:14:33.640" style="s2">baristas to see who can actually produce</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.210" end="00:14:48.550" style="s2">quality and standards has gone up</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.970" end="00:14:50.590" style="s2">enormous but as far as I know it&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.550" end="00:14:52.960" style="s2">cost the baristas do not share in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.590" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">profits of the of the coffee shops at</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.960" end="00:14:58.300" style="s2">least not as a piece of the architecture</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:15:01.420" style="s2">right and this seems like obvious like</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.300" end="00:15:04.060" style="s2">it should be the case yeah go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.420" end="00:15:07.510" style="s2">yeah no so there&#39;s just a bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.060" end="00:15:08.950" style="s2">is coming up around coffee and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.510" end="00:15:10.300" style="s2">pointing the direction of game like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.950" end="00:15:14.370" style="s2">think I mean you mentioned that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.300" end="00:15:18.760" style="s2">was a stage zeroth and I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.370" end="00:15:19.900" style="s2">coffee shops certainly in the UK and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.760" end="00:15:22.810" style="s2">need to do a bit more digging just to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.900" end="00:15:26.410" style="s2">clarify this but there&#39;s there are few</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.810" end="00:15:28.120" style="s2">people who have spoken about how a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.410" end="00:15:30.250" style="s2">of the kind of political changes that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.120" end="00:15:30.740" style="s2">took place like leading in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.250" end="00:15:32.510" style="s2">of Liberty</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.740" end="00:15:36.410" style="s2">kind of in general certainly certainly</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.510" end="00:15:38.330" style="s2">here yep and in coffee shops they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.410" end="00:15:40.459" style="s2">gone over and they were there was seem</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.330" end="00:15:44.360" style="s2">to be a bit of a threat by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.459" end="00:15:46.010" style="s2">establishment um and so I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.360" end="00:15:46.940" style="s2">feels a bit game B to you know like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.010" end="00:15:49.760" style="s2">is a place where we&#39;re gonna meet</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.940" end="00:15:51.560" style="s2">together discuss Yap discuss things get</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.760" end="00:15:55.160" style="s2">a little bit buzzed on the coffee here</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.560" end="00:15:57.050" style="s2">however have a mind of experience right</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.160" end="00:15:58.520" style="s2">that is novel this was new this was when</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.050" end="00:15:59.930" style="s2">coffee was first introduced to the west</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.520" end="00:16:02.510" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.930" end="00:16:05.560" style="s2">and by the way mix have young</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.510" end="00:16:08.660" style="s2">aristocrats with the merchant class with</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.560" end="00:16:11.029" style="s2">academics and scientists we&#39;re all kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.660" end="00:16:14.149" style="s2">of who normally would not mix a mix in</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.029" end="00:16:16.190" style="s2">this place yeah sure sure yeah so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.149" end="00:16:21.470" style="s2">yes a little talking us and the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.190" end="00:16:23.570" style="s2">thing as well is um I I mean at the risk</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.470" end="00:16:27.110" style="s2">of going like to deepen in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.570" end="00:16:28.520" style="s2">different direction and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.110" end="00:16:31.100" style="s2">know much about the details around</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.520" end="00:16:36.230" style="s2">coffee and how it was a like revered as</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.100" end="00:16:39.410" style="s2">a like an actual religious let&#39;s a call</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.230" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">it a sacrament for the yeah for like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.410" end="00:16:44.690" style="s2">indigenous people who you know we kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:46.520" style="s2">of Westerners are certainly from the UK</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.690" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">we went we went to the Americas and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.520" end="00:16:51.200" style="s2">took that you know like I know the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:54.890" style="s2">of fact it wasn&#39;t you learn another</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.200" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">story go ahead yes coffee is indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.890" end="00:17:02.149" style="s2">to Ethiopia but the Ethiopians actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:04.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t provide much coffee yes yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.149" end="00:17:05.870" style="s2">yeah yeah it wasn&#39;t really produced in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.730" end="00:17:08.150" style="s2">way that was meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.870" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">until the Ottoman Empire like so the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.150" end="00:17:12.920" style="s2">notion of the Turkish coffee was really</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:14.540" style="s2">it&#39;s bizarre like it&#39;s not the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.920" end="00:17:15.949" style="s2">it&#39;s not a modern thing I know not an</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.540" end="00:17:18.230" style="s2">ancient thing yeah and then what</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.949" end="00:17:20.300" style="s2">happened was the Ottoman Empire held</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.230" end="00:17:23.540" style="s2">them monopoly they did not allow able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.300" end="00:17:25.220" style="s2">know where coffee came from until at a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.540" end="00:17:28.700" style="s2">certain point there was a gift given by</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.220" end="00:17:30.140" style="s2">the Sultan to the King of France and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.700" end="00:17:32.330" style="s2">King of France had some coffee plants in</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.140" end="00:17:35.920" style="s2">a botanical garden and this young</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.330" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">adventurer like this total like rogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.920" end="00:17:40.309" style="s2">story-tell character stole the coffee</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:42.590" style="s2">plants from the king of France&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.309" end="00:17:44.510" style="s2">Botanical Garden smuggled them onto a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.590" end="00:17:46.730" style="s2">ship sailed them to South Amer</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.510" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">and then planted them in South America</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.730" end="00:17:51.700" style="s2">and began the process of actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.840" end="00:17:54.050" style="s2">bringing coffee to the masses okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.700" end="00:17:55.820" style="s2">okay well that&#39;s a shame because I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.050" end="00:17:57.650" style="s2">gonna we&#39;re gonna go deep in mystical</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.820" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">chocolate but chocolate is well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.650" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:08.540" style="s2">nonetheless I mean just if I can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:11.570" style="s2">have a little go at ruler mega ring that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.540" end="00:18:13.250" style="s2">yeah and but perhaps and with it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.570" end="00:18:15.020" style="s2">slightly slightly different slightly</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:19.550" style="s2">different twist so I think things will</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.020" end="00:18:21.110" style="s2">becoming less mechanistic and more more</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.550" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">human as the different stages have got</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.110" end="00:18:27.800" style="s2">have gone ahead especially this last</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.820" end="00:18:31.490" style="s2">stage like with the introduction of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.800" end="00:18:33.890" style="s2">almost it&#39;s become an art form art is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.490" end="00:18:38.120" style="s2">very nice yes and increasing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.890" end="00:18:41.240" style="s2">increasing art bullet yeah and um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.120" end="00:18:45.050" style="s2">it&#39;s less functional and it&#39;s and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.240" end="00:18:49.010" style="s2">more yes there&#39;s more creativity there</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.050" end="00:18:55.210" style="s2">it&#39;s less robotic so as a humanization</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.010" end="00:18:55.210" style="s2">of it and with each kind of stage and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.500" end="00:19:01.070" style="s2">that seems to be yeah and the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.690" end="00:19:03.710" style="s2">thing about human eyes obviously using</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.070" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">is including the the growers of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.710" end="00:19:09.980" style="s2">coffee in in in the profits and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:11.570" style="s2">humanizing those people rather than and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.980" end="00:19:13.370" style="s2">there&#39;s at the end there&#39;s a synergy</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.570" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">there and this is and this is perfect as</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.370" end="00:19:18.410" style="s2">this will bridge to the next topic which</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:21.170" style="s2">is finally do the AI topic yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.410" end="00:19:23.320" style="s2">synergy there is that the when the the</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.779" end="00:20:30.179" style="s2">degree can we have evolved the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.249" end="00:20:32.429" style="s2">that people are choosing to participate</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.470" end="00:20:43.710" style="s2">the zone of Nai we find something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.070" end="00:20:45.090" style="s2">is similar but and also in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.710" end="00:20:47.009" style="s2">oddly not very different and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.090" end="00:20:53.730" style="s2">it&#39;s very it&#39;s difficult to get a hold</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.659" end="00:21:49.490" style="s2">awesome reality is much much better at</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.789" end="00:21:52.200" style="s2">creative collaboration at the</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.629" end="00:22:07.019" style="s2">schools for the past two decades have</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.159" end="00:22:08.940" style="s2">been studying how do you support</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.019" end="00:22:11.730" style="s2">creative collaboration and they talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.940" end="00:22:13.230" style="s2">about things like every individual needs</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.730" end="00:22:14.670" style="s2">to have a feeling of meaning the</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.670" end="00:22:19.920" style="s2">needs to feel meaningful not just what</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.090" end="00:22:22.260" style="s2">their job is and then you have a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.920" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">of agency and autonomy real choice and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.260" end="00:22:25.170" style="s2">exactly how they&#39;re gonna go about doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:26.850" style="s2">these are all values that if it turns</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.170" end="00:22:29.850" style="s2">out if these ingredients are included</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.850" end="00:22:32.550" style="s2">then the quality of creative</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.850" end="00:22:34.950" style="s2">collaboration goes up okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.550" end="00:22:37.110" style="s2">so that&#39;s again it&#39;s just an intrinsic</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.110" end="00:22:40.650" style="s2">that it does that naturally want</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.610" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">students to get more game be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.650" end="00:22:44.730" style="s2">wants each individual to be finding</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.020" end="00:22:52.890" style="s2">that you could call their destiny and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.240" end="00:22:54.180" style="s2">you wants every individual who&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.890" end="00:22:56.820" style="s2">participating in something to be so</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.180" end="00:22:58.890" style="s2">fully into it they&#39;re committing it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.820" end="00:23:01.350" style="s2">used to call it uh following each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.890" end="00:23:03.690" style="s2">hey saying that&#39;s just yes but yay</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.350" end="00:23:05.100" style="s2">almost like yes this is a sacred duty</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.690" end="00:23:07.860" style="s2">I&#39;m not just agreeing but I&#39;m in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.100" end="00:23:10.140" style="s2">like see I feel that this is right with</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.860" end="00:23:12.210" style="s2">a capital R as Lucifer game B wants to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.140" end="00:23:14.490" style="s2">bring things and of course the point is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.210" end="00:23:17.880" style="s2">that that tends to be precisely the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.490" end="00:23:20.910" style="s2">to maximally create possibilities for</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.880" end="00:23:23.190" style="s2">creative collaboration okay well then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.910" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">turns out there&#39;s a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.190" end="00:23:30.660" style="s2">different endeavors let&#39;s say that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:32.010" style="s2">we&#39;re maximizing for the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.660" end="00:23:35.400" style="s2">creative collaboration is how you make</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.010" end="00:23:38.040" style="s2">the best thing the scientific research</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.400" end="00:23:40.650" style="s2">is an example the size I think method is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.040" end="00:23:42.870" style="s2">based upon the proposition of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.650" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">more game be like community back of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.870" end="00:23:47.100" style="s2">subject hunters at these coffee shops</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:49.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the overlap all right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.100" end="00:23:52.380" style="s2">create a space where more people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.560" end="00:23:55.500" style="s2">more able to tell the truth for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.380" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">and just the simplicity yeah I will try</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.500" end="00:23:58.530" style="s2">to tell the truth is earnestly I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:01.010" style="s2">into the comments as opposed to try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.530" end="00:24:05.310" style="s2">steer the story in some preferred way or</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.010" end="00:24:10.830" style="s2">withhold evidence is part of the ethos</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.310" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">of the scientific method and and I will</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.830" end="00:24:14.010" style="s2">share I will share that my information</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">and my techniques and my knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.010" end="00:24:19.500" style="s2">broadly with the sense of a common</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:21.000" style="s2">purpose so these were these were ethos</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.500" end="00:24:23.640" style="s2">and ethos that was discovered in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.000" end="00:24:25.650" style="s2">period in 1600 and 1700s that eventually</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.640" end="00:24:27.870" style="s2">gave rise to the Scientific Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.650" end="00:24:29.940" style="s2">because that mattes maximally or</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.870" end="00:24:32.250" style="s2">massively increases the possibility to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.940" end="00:24:34.710" style="s2">capacity for creative collaboration and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.250" end="00:24:35.880" style="s2">now of course game a weaponize that game</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.710" end="00:24:40.290" style="s2">a tried to figure out how to turn that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.880" end="00:24:42.120" style="s2">into a predictable tool for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.290" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">military-industrial complex for</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.120" end="00:24:47.820" style="s2">industrial and military production and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:49.860" style="s2">therefore competitive against in between</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.820" end="00:24:51.030" style="s2">different subgroups and that can that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.860" end="00:24:52.680" style="s2">can always be done which is always a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.030" end="00:24:58.230" style="s2">counter-current or way of capturing what</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.680" end="00:25:00.030" style="s2">game B you may able pulling him back in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.230" end="00:25:01.680" style="s2">the game and move and then a game a</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.030" end="00:25:04.440" style="s2">counter move that tries to capture it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.680" end="00:25:07.650" style="s2">encapsulated the game boobity game a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.440" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">cannibal so in the present environment</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.650" end="00:25:11.130" style="s2">we&#39;re finding ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:13.740" style="s2">circumstance where because accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.130" end="00:25:18.120" style="s2">chains because the the rate of change is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.740" end="00:25:21.750" style="s2">going up the count in the game a counter</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.120" end="00:25:23.910" style="s2">move becomes less and less valid because</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.750" end="00:25:26.580" style="s2">the thing that you&#39;re capturing</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.910" end="00:25:28.410" style="s2">literally the act of capturing it makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.580" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">it less competitive in the million in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.410" end="00:25:34.250" style="s2">the environment because tomorrow new</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:37.020" style="s2">innovations of how to collaborate and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.250" end="00:25:39.390" style="s2">small advantages and creative</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.020" end="00:25:43.650" style="s2">collaboration can lead to a 10x increase</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.390" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">in innovation and so I know if I have my</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.650" end="00:25:47.610" style="s2">standard game a move which is okay you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.650" style="s2">guys have done some really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.610" end="00:25:53.100" style="s2">work here in nanotechnology now let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.650" end="00:25:55.790" style="s2">figure out how to weaponize it the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.100" end="00:25:58.170" style="s2">that I&#39;ve captured is more obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.790" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">almost instantaneously because the rate</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.170" end="00:26:03.510" style="s2">of changes are high if every two years</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:04.800" style="s2">everything you familiar with it the rate</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.510" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">of new information is being discovered</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.800" end="00:26:14.790" style="s2">in the world well I don&#39;t know the exact</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:16.140" style="s2">numbers but I get the trajectory studied</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.790" end="00:26:18.840" style="s2">thoroughly but it&#39;s been said that more</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.140" end="00:26:21.300" style="s2">or less starting about a decade ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.840" end="00:26:23.400" style="s2">every year every eighteen months twice</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.300" end="00:26:26.990" style="s2">as the amount of total information the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.400" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">world doubles which means that in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.990" end="00:26:32.220" style="s2">there&#39;s everything literally everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:34.140" style="s2">that exists in the world in 2019 is half</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.220" end="00:26:36.540" style="s2">of what this produced in 2020 so as much</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.140" end="00:26:38.370" style="s2">as produced in just the year 2020 as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.540" end="00:26:39.720" style="s2">grand total of all human of all world</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.370" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.720" end="00:26:45.670" style="s2">and what&#39;s the definition of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:47.980" style="s2">massive and what&#39;s the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.670" end="00:26:50.710" style="s2">information is that like recorded held</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.980" end="00:26:52.690" style="s2">on a hard drive written in a tablet in</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.690" end="00:26:57.790" style="s2">structured structured accessible data</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:27:00.070" style="s2">right yes oh we&#39;re definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.790" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">talking about the the trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.070" end="00:27:05.380" style="s2">neutrinos in the five seconds after the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:07.810" style="s2">Big Bang yeah but we are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.380" end="00:27:10.270" style="s2">the degree to which we have awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.810" end="00:27:13.210" style="s2">that so because this is a human story</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.270" end="00:27:15.400" style="s2">right yeah yeah it&#39;s a human story yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.210" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">so so what happens then it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.400" end="00:27:19.510" style="s2">oh okay well what then are the places</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">the locations and what I call innovation</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.510" end="00:27:26.680" style="s2">space which is to say the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">space of where we might be able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.680" end="00:27:30.100" style="s2">something truly novel into the world and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:31.090" style="s2">it could be in any domain but right now</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.100" end="00:27:32.920" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of focusing in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.090" end="00:27:34.630" style="s2">scientific tentacle it could be an art</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.920" end="00:27:36.610" style="s2">right it could be in music it could be</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.630" end="00:27:39.810" style="s2">in literature but right now I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.610" end="00:27:39.810" style="s2">focused in the scientific technical and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.900" end="00:27:47.830" style="s2">this domain of intelligence this domain</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.670" end="00:27:54.610" style="s2">of creating using human ingenuity to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.830" end="00:28:03.900" style="s2">further cybernetic capacity to further</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.610" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">human ingenuity that loop is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.900" end="00:28:10.800" style="s2">exactly at the it stretching something</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:10.800" style="s2">to an infinite test in the sharp point</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.380" end="00:28:21.290" style="s2">yeah yeah so focus on that you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.570" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">focus a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.290" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">go for it yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:35.450" style="s2">right so if the problem is or the domain</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.020" end="00:28:38.330" style="s2">is innovation the domain is is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.450" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">go about finding and and realizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.330" end="00:28:45.020" style="s2">something that is truly new one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:47.330" style="s2">primary components is intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.020" end="00:28:49.940" style="s2">by intelligence I really in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.330" end="00:28:53.660" style="s2">just mean the ability to search the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.940" end="00:28:58.630" style="s2">space of possibility to discern possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.660" end="00:29:03.260" style="s2">or probable locations and then to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.630" end="00:29:05.270" style="s2">efficiently like quickly play through</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.260" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">those probabilities until those bitter</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.270" end="00:29:08.870" style="s2">actualize about so it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">search it&#39;s not quite like sir it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.870" end="00:29:15.320" style="s2">almost like I&#39;m reminded to have Vevey</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:17.090" style="s2">keys is it what he calls it the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.320" end="00:29:20.090" style="s2">possibility space or something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.090" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">where he&#39;s talking about the way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.090" end="00:29:26.870" style="s2">humans somehow able to just pull reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:29.900" style="s2">out of everything is that yeah the kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.870" end="00:29:30.590" style="s2">of ballpark it&#39;s exactly the same yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.900" end="00:29:33.290" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.590" end="00:29:34.940" style="s2">follow okay you&#39;ve got this this vast</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.290" end="00:29:37.100" style="s2">possibility space and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.940" end="00:29:39.770" style="s2">how are you able to actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.100" end="00:29:45.260" style="s2">like wander into mystery and an extract</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.770" end="00:29:48.100" style="s2">from mystery something that is both real</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.260" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">in the sense that it&#39;s reproducible and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.100" end="00:29:54.290" style="s2">meaningful in the sense that it actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.000" end="00:29:58.010" style="s2">creates change in some significant way</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.290" end="00:30:00.530" style="s2">and that relevance realization is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.010" end="00:30:03.140" style="s2">base for make easily enrolments</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.530" end="00:30:07.910" style="s2">realization realization is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.140" end="00:30:09.080" style="s2">holistic systemic omni modal way that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.910" end="00:30:12.200" style="s2">you would go about doing that and of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.080" end="00:30:13.940" style="s2">which intelligence is a very close piece</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.200" end="00:30:18.650" style="s2">of that it&#39;s not a full but piece of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.940" end="00:30:21.230" style="s2">course piece of it and and so augmenting</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.650" end="00:30:23.950" style="s2">our intelligence will for sure</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.230" end="00:30:26.270" style="s2">augmenting path C to to explore</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.950" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">possibilities but the students platoon</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.270" end="00:30:30.030" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:31.290" style="s2">innovation but if you focus on</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.030" end="00:30:32.490" style="s2">augmenting our intelligence and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.290" end="00:30:34.350" style="s2">possibilities because of augmenting our</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.490" end="00:30:36.330" style="s2">intelligence then you&#39;ve moved from</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.350" end="00:30:37.830" style="s2">velocity to acceleration then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.330" end="00:30:39.000" style="s2">you&#39;re saying ah well what is the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.830" end="00:30:41.070" style="s2">that I can go about increasing my</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.000" end="00:30:42.900" style="s2">capacity of increasing my capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.070" end="00:30:44.940" style="s2">this is like this doesn&#39;t stop it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.900" end="00:30:46.650" style="s2">like a recursion on that oh well how can</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.940" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">I find the thing on that so I go from</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.650" end="00:30:52.410" style="s2">velocity to acceleration to something</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:52.920" style="s2">called jerk to not know that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.410" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.920" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">jakers jerker is basically just the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:30:59.370" style="s2">derivative of acceleration so okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:02.130" style="s2">velocity is changing in location over</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.370" end="00:31:04.919" style="s2">time acceleration is changing velocity</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.130" end="00:31:07.169" style="s2">over time jerk has changed in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.919" end="00:31:09.299" style="s2">acceleration over time and then imagine</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.169" end="00:31:11.610" style="s2">if I have a small amount of jerk over</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.299" end="00:31:13.410" style="s2">over what your jerk is so my rate of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.610" end="00:31:15.690" style="s2">acceleration is higher than your rate of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.410" end="00:31:16.919" style="s2">acceleration obviously my velocity is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.690" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">gonna be a lot higher than your velocity</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.919" end="00:31:22.940" style="s2">quickly my location is gonna blow you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:25.380" style="s2">away and so is this this sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.940" end="00:31:27.750" style="s2">recursive infinitesimal in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.380" end="00:31:31.230" style="s2">directionality of optimization on how</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.750" end="00:31:33.330" style="s2">optimization optimization and as it</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.230" end="00:31:35.610" style="s2">turns out there&#39;s two things about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.330" end="00:31:39.210" style="s2">that make it extraordinarily available</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.610" end="00:31:40.290" style="s2">to the game be approached by the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.210" end="00:31:43.799" style="s2">beginning to think that maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.290" end="00:31:50.299" style="s2">should be broadcast more publicly pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.799" end="00:31:52.590" style="s2">pretty important okay so one piece is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.299" end="00:31:59.160" style="s2">capacity for creative collaboration like</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.590" end="00:32:00.929" style="s2">truly divergent thinking and learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.160" end="00:32:02.780" style="s2">how in your body to actually build an</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.929" end="00:32:06.690" style="s2">increasing capacity for things like</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.780" end="00:32:10.110" style="s2">practical intuition and like really</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.690" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">sussing out the thing that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.110" end="00:32:14.790" style="s2">genius level insight that&#39;s all the kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:16.860" style="s2">of stuff that is smack dab in the center</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.790" end="00:32:18.330" style="s2">of the game be focused like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.860" end="00:32:19.620" style="s2">game B is all about developing in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.330" end="00:32:22.049" style="s2">individuals and then in groups that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.620" end="00:32:24.630" style="s2">coherence is a word that can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.049" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">describe a group that has a capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.630" end="00:32:28.710" style="s2">genius as a group not a capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:31.500" style="s2">just being smart as a group but a</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.500" end="00:32:36.750" style="s2">you&#39;re going down this this recursive</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.410" end="00:32:40.169" style="s2">spiral from position to velocity or</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.750" end="00:32:41.340" style="s2">acceleration to jerk from innovation to</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.049" end="00:32:48.570" style="s2">this capacity for collective genius is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.740" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">the thing like that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.570" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">enables you to begin to make continue to</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:54.149" style="s2">make progress on that curve so it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.149" end="00:32:59.490" style="s2">backwards up the stack and by the way it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.379" end="00:33:00.929" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be entirely theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.490" end="00:33:02.639" style="s2">or esoteric you can actually find</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.929" end="00:33:06.269" style="s2">locations that are on the bleeding edge</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.639" end="00:33:09.179" style="s2">so just like AI used for automated</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:43.829" style="s2">and in the cascade effects that&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.630" end="00:36:58.589" style="s2">affect essential risk that goes to the</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.589" end="00:37:02.069" style="s2">is galling this gets really nasty</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.270" end="00:37:03.450" style="s2">in a certain point but certainly they</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.069" end="00:37:06.569" style="s2">are complete and utter elimination of</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.440" end="00:37:27.270" style="s2">game a you can&#39;t even begin to do that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.540" end="00:37:29.670" style="s2">in game a there&#39;s a Nash equilibrium or</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.270" end="00:37:32.490" style="s2">a multipolar trap of increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.670" end="00:37:35.730" style="s2">reckless competition in China and Google</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.490" end="00:37:37.800" style="s2">on AI research if Google doesn&#39;t push</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.730" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">the push the envelope and with maximum</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.800" end="00:37:41.190" style="s2">recklessness then they all they they</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:42.510" style="s2">just know they&#39;re gonna fall behind</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.190" end="00:37:44.520" style="s2">China and trying to notice the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.510" end="00:37:45.840" style="s2">thing and so now they&#39;re just stuck and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.520" end="00:37:47.070" style="s2">if you go to China and say geez don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.840" end="00:37:48.420" style="s2">stress is dangerous like yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.070" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">really dangerous but if we slow down</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.420" end="00:37:51.900" style="s2">Google Google will do it now google&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">like well if we slow down china will do</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.900" end="00:37:56.610" style="s2">it wow so you realize is that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:57.870" style="s2">are both driving everybody off the cliff</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.610" end="00:38:00.030" style="s2">and you also realize that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.870" end="00:38:02.790" style="s2">possibly stop that&#39;s a game a trap that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.030" end="00:38:05.750" style="s2">happens all the time the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.790" end="00:38:07.620" style="s2">game be trap is actually finding a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.750" end="00:38:09.330" style="s2">because of this thing that&#39;s describing</p>

<p begin="00:38:24.570" end="00:38:30.240" style="s2">seriously that we you&#39;re beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.470" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">realize that the thing that&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.240" end="00:38:33.600" style="s2">very tip of that point of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.710" end="00:38:35.940" style="s2">on intelligence and intelligence can be</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.940" end="00:38:40.250" style="s2">I can&#39;t say that the most important</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.130" end="00:38:42.840" style="s2">thing I&#39;m working on an AI right now is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.250" end="00:38:45.240" style="s2">self-driving cars or even like</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.840" end="00:38:47.790" style="s2">nanotechnology or solar the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.240" end="00:38:49.590" style="s2">has to be in front of everything is how</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.790" end="00:38:52.500" style="s2">do I make sure that we don&#39;t action the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.590" end="00:38:55.020" style="s2">tip over the the precipice of</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.050" end="00:39:20.030" style="s2">I was going after so it&#39;s a very weird</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.099" end="00:39:28.859" style="s2">let me give you this the moon make it</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.660" end="00:39:32.549" style="s2">very concrete there are people right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.859" end="00:39:34.829" style="s2">who are who have the capacity they know</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.549" end="00:39:35.969" style="s2">things they knew they have scientific</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.969" end="00:39:41.699" style="s2">that is close not quite we&#39;re like in</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.599" end="00:39:42.989" style="s2">the zone between R&amp;D and engineering but</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.589" end="00:40:09.589" style="s2">from 40 watts to 160 watts it means from</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.509" end="00:40:12.089" style="s2">30% efficient to 60 percent efficient</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.589" end="00:40:12.709" style="s2">something like that like the order of</p>

<p begin="00:40:45.630" end="00:40:49.289" style="s2">global energy needs right now it still</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.039" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">has to be subsidized by fossil fuels but</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.289" end="00:40:54.059" style="s2">if you could use if you get that level</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:55.709" style="s2">of upgrade in performance it is so BAM</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.059" end="00:40:57.089" style="s2">being just transition to that and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.709" end="00:40:59.459" style="s2">start getting this massive accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.089" end="00:41:00.779" style="s2">curve on a new form of technology which</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.459" end="00:41:04.259" style="s2">by the way if you use this nanotech the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.779" end="00:41:08.430" style="s2">way of making is also throws off of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.259" end="00:41:10.499" style="s2">externalities well that gap at the level</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.430" end="00:41:12.449" style="s2">of the degree of difficulty of getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.499" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">over that hump like we&#39;re close we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.449" end="00:41:14.699" style="s2">not quite there but the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:17.369" style="s2">difficulty is actually quite high</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.699" end="00:41:19.079" style="s2">because the specifics company specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.369" end="00:41:23.069" style="s2">complexity is quite high so they&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.079" end="00:41:24.769" style="s2">perfect game B project and I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.069" end="00:41:27.809" style="s2">comfortable giving that level of power</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.769" end="00:41:29.249" style="s2">to anyone who isn&#39;t able to be bound to</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.249" end="00:41:36.510" style="s2">in a deep way I could finance the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.900" end="00:41:39.590" style="s2">finance thing or the solar common</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.510" end="00:41:44.970" style="s2">the technology the nanotechnology right</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.590" end="00:41:46.470" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s there&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.970" end="00:41:48.630" style="s2">that&#39;s going on right now there&#39;s a guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.470" end="00:41:50.520" style="s2">named George church who&#39;s the leader of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.630" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">one of the major labs researching CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.520" end="00:41:59.820" style="s2">technology and one of the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:42:01.080" style="s2">they&#39;re working on is designing a what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.820" end="00:42:02.910" style="s2">called a gene Drive that could</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.080" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">effectively eliminate the entire species</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.910" end="00:42:09.900" style="s2">of malaria carrying mosquitoes which I</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:12.060" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you know the history of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.900" end="00:42:14.460" style="s2">the Green Revolution but um it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.060" end="00:42:15.869" style="s2">these things where in a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.460" end="00:42:17.250" style="s2">framework when you look at it&#39;s like wow</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.869" end="00:42:18.869" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be really good that will</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.250" end="00:42:19.950" style="s2">save a lot of lives or watch people die</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.869" end="00:42:21.990" style="s2">from malaria and you could just</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.950" end="00:42:25.260" style="s2">eliminate the species of mosquitoes that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.990" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">provides that you will effectively save</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.260" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">all of them so tens the millions and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:36.300" style="s2">hundreds of millions over decades okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">yeah and a thing that can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.300" end="00:42:41.490" style="s2">create a gene drug that can eliminate a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:42.900" style="s2">species of mosquitoes probably really</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.490" end="00:42:44.550" style="s2">increases the possibility of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.900" end="00:42:47.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say targeting any species at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.550" end="00:42:49.790" style="s2">or perhaps even subspecies perhaps he</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.640" end="00:42:52.980" style="s2">didn&#39;t say like lineage human lineages</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.790" end="00:42:54.510" style="s2">and also by the way the absolute a</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.980" end="00:42:56.970" style="s2">removal of an entire species from an</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.510" end="00:42:58.520" style="s2">ecosystem may have complex unintended</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.970" end="00:43:03.390" style="s2">consequences that we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.520" end="00:43:05.100" style="s2">and so we&#39;re in this very again this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.390" end="00:43:07.850" style="s2">sort of a Nash equilibrium in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.100" end="00:43:10.230" style="s2">if if the Stanford guys don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.850" end="00:43:11.760" style="s2">maybe the Chinese will and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.230" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">have that capacity that we&#39;re gonna fall</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.760" end="00:43:14.730" style="s2">behind them both in terms of economic</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:16.050" style="s2">competitiveness there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.730" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">cool tools that are unleashed by that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.050" end="00:43:19.050" style="s2">and maybe also military competitiveness</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:20.550" style="s2">we don&#39;t want the Chinese have any</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.050" end="00:43:23.330" style="s2">create a gene Drive that could sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.550" end="00:43:25.619" style="s2">eliminate all white people for examples</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.330" end="00:43:26.609" style="s2">which is bizarre because like the answer</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.619" end="00:43:30.570" style="s2">what we want to be able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.609" end="00:43:32.070" style="s2">capacity its intruder okay great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.570" end="00:43:33.720" style="s2">that&#39;s like now we&#39;re kind of at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.070" end="00:43:36.869" style="s2">efficient engine if you want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.720" end="00:43:41.450" style="s2">to really get ahead of everybody else in</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.869" end="00:43:45.510" style="s2">that kind of a landscape a game B</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.450" end="00:43:48.810" style="s2">approach should be better okay actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.510" end="00:43:50.339" style="s2">should generate more collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.810" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">creative collaborative capacity</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.339" end="00:44:00.569" style="s2">to do innovation in that domain and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:02.339" style="s2">and here&#39;s the trick kids know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.569" end="00:44:04.170" style="s2">this in front and get a sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.339" end="00:44:05.579" style="s2">competitive advantage but then use that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.170" end="00:44:08.609" style="s2">sustainable competitive advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.579" end="00:44:12.479" style="s2">actually slow the whole thing down so</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.609" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">that we don&#39;t find ourselves killing</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.479" end="00:44:15.989" style="s2">ourselves because we increasingly make</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.719" style="s2">more powerful with an intervening in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.989" end="00:44:20.539" style="s2">world that we can handle like that kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.719" end="00:44:23.999" style="s2">of a trick</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.539" end="00:44:25.739" style="s2">it&#39;s me mint it&#39;s that&#39;s gonna be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.999" end="00:44:28.549" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.739" end="00:44:33.029" style="s2">difficult problem though isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.549" end="00:44:35.009" style="s2">cuz as far as I can tell it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.029" end="00:44:39.029" style="s2">to solve it at all right because that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.009" end="00:44:41.519" style="s2">pivot from well we&#39;re winning in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.029" end="00:44:47.579" style="s2">of game a competitive way but with game</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.519" end="00:44:50.249" style="s2">be principled angry principles but then</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.579" end="00:44:52.199" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need to pivot that in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.249" end="00:44:55.469" style="s2">such a way that we can control other</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.199" end="00:45:01.049" style="s2">actors that perhaps aren&#39;t game B yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.469" end="00:45:02.489" style="s2">and it&#39;s trying to get yeah example so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.049" end="00:45:06.239" style="s2">here&#39;s an example that might that might</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.489" end="00:45:08.069" style="s2">work so consider this I&#39;m gonna drop two</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.239" end="00:45:10.619" style="s2">things into the into the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.069" end="00:45:13.469" style="s2">see how that changes the game theory the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.619" end="00:45:17.329" style="s2">way it plays out one thing is I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.469" end="00:45:20.519" style="s2">to drop in a an open patent left concept</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.329" end="00:45:25.979" style="s2">you through--the copy maps like in open</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.519" end="00:45:27.539" style="s2">source vaguely but go ahead and lucky</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.979" end="00:45:30.599" style="s2">again it&#39;s easy to give you so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.539" end="00:45:35.429" style="s2">okay the the way that copy Maps works is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.599" end="00:45:38.429" style="s2">it says okay here&#39;s the the terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.429" end="00:45:41.880" style="s2">agreement for you to use this software</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.429" end="00:45:45.239" style="s2">or this intellectual property are that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.880" end="00:45:46.859" style="s2">you must make your software an</p>

<p begin="00:45:46.859" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">this license it&#39;s kind of a viral</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:58.140" style="s2">if by virtue of using Apache you also</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.489" end="00:45:59.819" style="s2">make whatever you&#39;re making available</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.140" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">under the same license so it has a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.819" end="00:46:05.070" style="s2">opening characteristic it has to open</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:08.250" style="s2">more things if anybody wants to use it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.070" end="00:46:11.480" style="s2">and so to the degree to which the tools</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.250" end="00:46:14.700" style="s2">that are in this patent left category</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.480" end="00:46:15.390" style="s2">are valuable and useful people like them</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.700" end="00:46:17.460" style="s2">they have a competitive advantage</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.390" end="00:46:20.340" style="s2">they&#39;re better tools then you&#39;ll begin</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.460" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">to find more and more people choose to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.340" end="00:46:26.340" style="s2">sign up for the patent left a set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:28.380" style="s2">agreements less and less people will</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.340" end="00:46:32.100" style="s2">sign up for proprietary would have</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.380" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">called closed approaches um so you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.100" end="00:46:37.890" style="s2">you young entrepreneur wanted to move</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:42.600" style="s2">forward in the sages gene Drive space</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.890" end="00:46:45.540" style="s2">will participate in the patent left</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.600" end="00:46:46.980" style="s2">universe because participate</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.540" end="00:46:49.320" style="s2">participating in the other universe</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.980" end="00:46:50.820" style="s2">before closes you from so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.320" end="00:46:51.780" style="s2">core intellectual property in your</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.820" end="00:46:53.610" style="s2">universe you really just can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.780" end="00:46:56.190" style="s2">anything effective there&#39;s a critical</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.610" end="00:46:57.900" style="s2">point at which if I can&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.190" end="00:46:59.850" style="s2">these key pieces of technology I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.900" end="00:47:01.530" style="s2">kind of can&#39;t do anything alright great</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.850" end="00:47:04.440" style="s2">so then enables us to do is it enables</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.530" end="00:47:06.690" style="s2">us to then wire in more ethical</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.440" end="00:47:09.750" style="s2">constraints on people who choose to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.690" end="00:47:13.770" style="s2">engage in in in patent left in this open</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.750" end="00:47:16.140" style="s2">for example genetics pen environment so</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.770" end="00:47:20.250" style="s2">we go in with you know Tesla made all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.140" end="00:47:23.010" style="s2">their patents available for free no yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.250" end="00:47:25.740" style="s2">so Tesla had expense in electric cars</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.010" end="00:47:27.780" style="s2">and like last year or two years ago how</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.740" end="00:47:30.180" style="s2">long must go down stem all available for</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.780" end="00:47:32.040" style="s2">free was just giving him away now if</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.180" end="00:47:34.290" style="s2">instead of just giving them away he had</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.040" end="00:47:36.360" style="s2">actually given them away under a patent</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.290" end="00:47:39.660" style="s2">left structure meaning anybody can use</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.360" end="00:47:42.660" style="s2">these but anybody who uses these must</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.660" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">also give their patents away under this</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.660" end="00:47:49.050" style="s2">exact same license and let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:50.580" style="s2">for example everybody has everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.050" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">whose son said to this license also must</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.580" end="00:47:58.470" style="s2">give twenty percent of their net profits</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:48:00.810" style="s2">to a game B fund or a nanotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.470" end="00:48:02.790" style="s2">research for recycling solar power</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.810" end="00:48:04.740" style="s2">panels but that&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.790" end="00:48:06.120" style="s2">like a finding a way to actually think</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.740" end="00:48:07.770" style="s2">about how the total ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.120" end="00:48:10.010" style="s2">electric cars could be furthered by</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.770" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">generating the right kind of ethical</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.010" end="00:48:14.430" style="s2">components yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:18.390" style="s2">piece so one piece is okay can you</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.430" end="00:48:21.150" style="s2">create an ecosystem dynamic where</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.390" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">participation in the ecosystem means</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.150" end="00:48:24.930" style="s2">that people&#39;s choices are now instead of</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:27.480" style="s2">going in a direction of a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.930" end="00:48:32.510" style="s2">race toward to the end they&#39;re naturally</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.480" end="00:48:34.380" style="s2">now engaging in a collaborative thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.510" end="00:48:35.460" style="s2">that is interested intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.380" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">endurable I&#39;m participating in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.460" end="00:48:39.120" style="s2">ecosystem it&#39;s going to work and if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:40.080" style="s2">don&#39;t participate in the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.120" end="00:48:40.770" style="s2">you&#39;re really not competitive in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.080" end="00:48:44.520" style="s2">environment at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.770" end="00:48:47.490" style="s2">so that&#39;s one piece the other side is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.520" end="00:48:51.750" style="s2">guilt a guilt but it&#39;s like a union</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.490" end="00:48:54.150" style="s2">which is to say to participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.750" end="00:48:57.690" style="s2">ecosystem as an individual I must also</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.150" end="00:49:01.710" style="s2">be a member of the guild as a member of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.690" end="00:49:05.100" style="s2">the guild I agree to kind of two things</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.710" end="00:49:06.750" style="s2">one is I agree to further my progress in</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.100" end="00:49:10.100" style="s2">my game be evolution to become</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.750" end="00:49:12.360" style="s2">increasing the sovereign to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.100" end="00:49:14.660" style="s2">show up responsibly and to build my own</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.360" end="00:49:19.110" style="s2">personal wisdom as well as my skill set</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:20.940" style="s2">second I agree not to give any of my</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.110" end="00:49:23.490" style="s2">gifts and if my intelligence my</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.940" end="00:49:27.060" style="s2">knowledge my wisdoms any effort that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.490" end="00:49:34.320" style="s2">not connected to the guilt right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.060" end="00:49:35.670" style="s2">let&#39;s say bad guy biotech company wants</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.320" end="00:49:39.000" style="s2">to do something quite reckless in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.670" end="00:49:40.620" style="s2">direction of research in gene drives and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.000" end="00:49:43.560" style="s2">so therefore they refuse to sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.620" end="00:49:45.210" style="s2">the the ecosystem agreements construct</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.560" end="00:49:46.320" style="s2">they&#39;re like we&#39;re going our own well</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.210" end="00:49:48.200" style="s2">one of the things that happens is they</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.320" end="00:49:50.190" style="s2">can&#39;t access any of the guild members</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.200" end="00:49:54.930" style="s2">knowledge and capacity no guild number</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.190" end="00:49:55.980" style="s2">will collaborate with them and that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.930" end="00:49:58.530" style="s2">make it very hard for them to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.980" end="00:50:00.300" style="s2">competitive now there&#39;s a point at which</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.530" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">but there&#39;s a point at which it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.300" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">really matter there&#39;s a point at which</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:04.680" style="s2">there&#39;s just enough talent in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:07.080" style="s2">marketplace that will work for wages</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.680" end="00:50:09.060" style="s2">right it will basically subordinate</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.080" end="00:50:10.800" style="s2">their sovereignty and their choice</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.060" end="00:50:16.310" style="s2">making to somebody else in exchange for</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.800" end="00:50:18.360" style="s2">dollars but there&#39;s a point where a</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.310" end="00:50:19.740" style="s2">tipping point where there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.360" end="00:50:22.080" style="s2">knowledge and capacity people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.740" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">refused to do so who will only give</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.080" end="00:50:27.330" style="s2">their gifts into something that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:29.670" style="s2">ethical and an ecosystem that will</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.330" end="00:50:31.380" style="s2">actually continue to work and during Lee</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.670" end="00:50:32.210" style="s2">under the context of accelerating change</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.380" end="00:50:35.089" style="s2">and for</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.210" end="00:50:38.119" style="s2">everyone that begins to evaporate the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.089" end="00:50:40.300" style="s2">game a choice making and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.119" end="00:50:42.859" style="s2">not that big a tipping point because</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.300" end="00:50:45.589" style="s2">more and more people would prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.859" end="00:50:48.920" style="s2">work in something which is gives them</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.589" end="00:50:52.270" style="s2">access to autonomy on their own creative</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.920" end="00:50:54.410" style="s2">fall in their own creative directions</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.270" end="00:50:57.710" style="s2">supports them increasing their</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.410" end="00:50:59.330" style="s2">sovereignty and their capacity for real</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.710" end="00:51:02.089" style="s2">and meaningful relationships with other</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.330" end="00:51:05.330" style="s2">people um and also is fully committed as</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.089" end="00:51:07.930" style="s2">a collaborative to making sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.330" end="00:51:10.730" style="s2">choices were making collectively are</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.930" end="00:51:13.099" style="s2">differently it&#39;s not existential but</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.730" end="00:51:14.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a good it&#39;s just good right so more</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.099" end="00:51:15.650" style="s2">and more people want to be participating</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.210" end="00:51:17.300" style="s2">in something that is good that is good</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.650" end="00:51:18.560" style="s2">for them and it&#39;s good for the world and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.300" end="00:51:20.450" style="s2">if it were possible you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.560" end="00:51:21.859" style="s2">make that available as choice they would</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.450" end="00:51:22.910" style="s2">choose to do so which means that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.859" end="00:51:24.200" style="s2">would not choose to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.910" end="00:51:25.640" style="s2">things that are bad and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.200" end="00:51:28.070" style="s2">bad would have Lex access to resources</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.640" end="00:51:31.430" style="s2">or begin to just simply go away right so</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.070" end="00:51:33.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a structural or an architectural</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.430" end="00:51:36.140" style="s2">way of weaving up something in this game</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.740" end="00:51:38.180" style="s2">be dynamic that could solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.140" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">something along those lines so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.180" end="00:51:46.040" style="s2">that yeah it&#39;s very interesting and now</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:47.930" style="s2">that there was some some pushback coming</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.040" end="00:51:52.910" style="s2">but then this is what I did I&#39;m I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.930" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">bit of a licker I instantly like what</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.910" end="00:51:58.190" style="s2">appears to me often is is well how might</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">that be where might the problems lie in</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.190" end="00:52:04.990" style="s2">yeah so can I can I do it throw so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:08.089" style="s2">is that is that okay yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.990" end="00:52:09.710" style="s2">only for not not to guy Bosch anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.089" end="00:52:11.180" style="s2">but - you know - hopefully we can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.710" end="00:52:20.030" style="s2">generated generative with it</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.180" end="00:52:24.619" style="s2">so um so the first thing is like it</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.030" end="00:52:29.570" style="s2">needs to be I think enough under the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.619" end="00:52:36.230" style="s2">radar in in the first instance to not</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.570" end="00:52:39.320" style="s2">just get blown out of the water by a n a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.230" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">n of the mega-corporation like in</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.320" end="00:52:44.900" style="s2">whichever whichever space that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:46.110" style="s2">operating in um it needs to there needs</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.900" end="00:52:49.110" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.110" end="00:52:51.000" style="s2">because back to this back to this money</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.110" end="00:52:52.380" style="s2">thing oh and it isn&#39;t just a and other</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.000" end="00:52:54.890" style="s2">corporations by the way that I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.380" end="00:52:58.250" style="s2">thinking about governments too because</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.890" end="00:53:00.570" style="s2">yeah they want to they want to generate</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.250" end="00:53:04.700" style="s2">tax income and they want to probably do</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.570" end="00:53:07.140" style="s2">that in whatever currency that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.700" end="00:53:12.270" style="s2">operating in and the more stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.140" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">like free the less they&#39;re able to to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.270" end="00:53:21.030" style="s2">that so there&#39;s some kind of lobbying</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:22.650" style="s2">arm and then and so and again the only</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.030" end="00:53:26.610" style="s2">solutions that are coming a kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.650" end="00:53:28.530" style="s2">a ones you know um you know like if</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.610" end="00:53:30.780" style="s2">you&#39;re learning competing is it you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.530" end="00:53:36.560" style="s2">game be has its own lobby group and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.780" end="00:53:36.560" style="s2">you know lobbying government to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.710" end="00:53:44.520" style="s2">maybe reduce patent patent legislation</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.770" end="00:53:47.100" style="s2">or or even if even if not there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.520" end="00:53:52.380" style="s2">to be some pushback from game a for sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.100" end="00:53:57.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s some problems and that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.380" end="00:53:57.800" style="s2">gonna need need ironing out and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.030" end="00:54:04.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this this the same same problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.120" end="00:54:05.790" style="s2">and they said this is perhaps a personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.680" end="00:54:09.540" style="s2">one to me but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.790" end="00:54:13.500" style="s2">person that&#39;s um this living this kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.540" end="00:54:15.750" style="s2">of living it and is that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.500" end="00:54:17.490" style="s2">transition period that&#39;s a tricky bit so</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.750" end="00:54:20.190" style="s2">say I wanted to sign up for one of these</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.490" end="00:54:25.590" style="s2">guilds and I needed to agree not to work</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.190" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">on anything other than game B projects</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.590" end="00:54:32.460" style="s2">or then right how can I still pay my</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:36.420" style="s2">taxes and pay my mortgage and due to</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.460" end="00:54:38.660" style="s2">being a being a game a person thing well</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.420" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">then there needs to be flexibility in</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.660" end="00:54:44.820" style="s2">that that contract at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:47.250" style="s2">initial phases you see so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.820" end="00:54:49.980" style="s2">won&#39;t need to I think to shuffle my way</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.250" end="00:54:51.210" style="s2">in and as the guild gets stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.980" end="00:54:53.540" style="s2">stronger and stronger and starts to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.210" end="00:54:55.980" style="s2">able to provide more and more resources</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:31.630" style="s2">intelligence to make breakthroughs or</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.280" end="00:59:33.340" style="s2">breakthroughs are needed and just make</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.630" end="00:59:35.050" style="s2">simple choices where simple choices are</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.340" end="00:59:36.700" style="s2">already available to do better stock</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.050" end="00:59:38.200" style="s2">because most of it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.700" end="00:59:39.400" style="s2">simple only most of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.200" end="00:59:42.040" style="s2">right now in the world as the humans</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.400" end="00:59:44.590" style="s2">have been pushed very very far away from</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.040" end="00:59:47.170" style="s2">what human beings naturally I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.590" end="00:59:48.700" style="s2">like to do yeah and and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.170" end="00:59:50.200" style="s2">have to inject ourselves with a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.700" end="00:59:52.930" style="s2">large number of artificial stimulants</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.200" end="00:59:56.890" style="s2">can fill that gap of meaning for its</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.930" end="00:59:59.530" style="s2">most of the problem I know yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.890" end="01:00:02.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a few places where that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.530" end="01:00:05.590" style="s2">thing a kind of thing not oh the exact</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.800" end="01:00:07.600" style="s2">same thing by any stretch but happens</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.590" end="01:00:11.140" style="s2">sort of already so there&#39;s the hippie</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.600" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">commune thing so there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.140" end="01:00:16.050" style="s2">lessons that would need learning there</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:18.280" style="s2">and yep and then there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.050" end="01:00:20.740" style="s2">religious you know I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.280" end="01:00:23.380" style="s2">like monks maybe living together in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.740" end="01:00:25.240" style="s2">monastery or yeah like so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.380" end="01:00:28.630" style="s2">religious yeah you nailed it I really</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.240" end="01:00:30.460" style="s2">yeah so so can I give you this is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.630" end="01:00:32.410" style="s2">is a more advanced language it may not</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.460" end="01:00:33.430" style="s2">work okay if I can give it to you we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.410" end="01:00:35.110" style="s2">actually make some real progress</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.430" end="01:00:36.310" style="s2">okay these kinds of things if you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.110" end="01:00:41.310" style="s2">the right kind of tools you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.310" end="01:00:41.310" style="s2">solve really hard problems yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.390" end="01:00:48.310" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a particular philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.540" end="01:00:50.770" style="s2">the one of my collaborators just worked</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.310" end="01:00:53.140" style="s2">out but is able to identify that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.770" end="01:00:55.720" style="s2">three fundamental modalities that make</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.140" end="01:00:57.370" style="s2">up what we call the real reality and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.720" end="01:00:59.530" style="s2">it&#39;s important to recognize that each of</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.370" end="01:01:02.410" style="s2">those data means modalities is distinct</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.530" end="01:01:03.850" style="s2">they are like X Y Z you know no amount</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.410" end="01:01:04.810" style="s2">of the X dimension is gonna get you any</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.850" end="01:01:06.550" style="s2">amount of the Y dimension they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.810" end="01:01:08.800" style="s2">distinct but if you have X Y and Z&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.550" end="01:01:10.270" style="s2">a three-dimensional space so Lord Allah</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.800" end="01:01:12.850" style="s2">days and he there was issue of his names</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.270" end="01:01:14.230" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re reasonably well</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.850" end="01:01:16.660" style="s2">chose so one modality is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.230" end="01:01:17.830" style="s2">transcendent modality and that more or</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.660" end="01:01:20.010" style="s2">less maps to your monastery</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.830" end="01:01:22.950" style="s2">it&#39;s more or less than a person amongst</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.010" end="01:01:26.680" style="s2">feels like the sacred the spacious the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.950" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2">eternal connections spirituality those</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.680" end="01:01:30.610" style="s2">are kind of like transcendent modalities</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:32.830" style="s2">by the way it&#39;s most specifically it</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.610" end="01:01:35.520" style="s2">actually has to do the space between</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.830" end="01:01:39.580" style="s2">domains but we can go there good like</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.520" end="01:01:40.420" style="s2">then you have the eminent modality the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.580" end="01:01:46.180" style="s2">eminent mood</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.420" end="01:01:48.549" style="s2">is the as presents the slow of life</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.180" end="01:01:51.339" style="s2">moment to moment embodiment actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.549" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">being in life like sitting in the in my</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.339" end="01:01:53.200" style="s2">backyard looking at that plan like Here</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:54.970" style="s2">I am</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.200" end="01:01:56.680" style="s2">right now that kind of goes and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.970" end="01:02:02.710" style="s2">actually that&#39;s kind of true hippie</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.680" end="01:02:05.380" style="s2">commune or to an indigenous tribe and</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.710" end="01:02:07.960" style="s2">then he have the emission and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.380" end="01:02:09.309" style="s2">emissions is many ways it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.960" end="01:02:12.220" style="s2">things like complicated this to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.309" end="01:02:14.980" style="s2">technology to knowledge to knowing to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.220" end="01:02:18.510" style="s2">being able to use information structures</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.980" end="01:02:20.680" style="s2">to constrain and control what happens</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.510" end="01:02:23.260" style="s2">causation to build to build things</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.680" end="01:02:25.720" style="s2">engineering and this actually starts to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.260" end="01:02:27.369" style="s2">map to modern Western civilization in</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.720" end="01:02:29.829" style="s2">general I was gonna say it feels a bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.369" end="01:02:32.980" style="s2">gay may actually that last one that last</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.829" end="01:02:35.380" style="s2">piece it&#39;s very game gaming is give me</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.980" end="01:02:37.599" style="s2">is very much what happens when you buy</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.380" end="01:02:39.279" style="s2">us heavily towards the omniscient right</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.599" end="01:02:41.529" style="s2">and by the way that happens with</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.279" end="01:02:42.970" style="s2">objectively bias towards ammunition</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.529" end="01:02:44.970" style="s2">meaning that we tend to try to solve</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.970" end="01:02:47.140" style="s2">problems using complicated solutions and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.970" end="01:02:48.940" style="s2">subjectively we try to think through</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.140" end="01:02:50.980" style="s2">problems using complicated toolkits that</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.940" end="01:02:53.829" style="s2">our heads and in art relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.980" end="01:02:55.720" style="s2">where the in one of the insights where</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.829" end="01:02:58.599" style="s2">the powers of game be is to say ah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.720" end="01:03:01.509" style="s2">it&#39;s not any one of these three it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.599" end="01:03:02.519" style="s2">actually a three dimensional space that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.509" end="01:03:04.809" style="s2">brings them all into right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.519" end="01:03:06.369" style="s2">so we actually need something like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.809" end="01:03:07.630" style="s2">monastery we need something like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.369" end="01:03:10.539" style="s2">hippie commune means something like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.630" end="01:03:11.980" style="s2">googolplex and you know is just like</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.539" end="01:03:13.450" style="s2">kind of like you know mix them all</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.980" end="01:03:14.880" style="s2">together it&#39;s not a squish she&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.450" end="01:03:19.869" style="s2">like squishing together it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.880" end="01:03:22.059" style="s2">baking a cake and that&#39;s like I can a</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.869" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">smoothie what&#39;s your call that&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.059" end="01:03:27.130" style="s2">aggregate it&#39;s like mixing a bag of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:31.420" style="s2">gravel right and there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.130" end="01:03:34.930" style="s2">way of actually bringing the the deepest</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.420" end="01:03:37.480" style="s2">called insider specificity of each of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.930" end="01:03:39.190" style="s2">these modalities into an integrated</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.480" end="01:03:41.380" style="s2">whole we should then be called reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.190" end="01:03:43.269" style="s2">so I&#39;m just what I&#39;m getting here now</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.380" end="01:03:45.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve no idea if it&#39;s of any use but it</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.269" end="01:03:48.190" style="s2">came and sorry to interrupt but I just</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.400" end="01:03:50.529" style="s2">felt like I&#39;d say it like oh I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.190" end="01:03:52.900" style="s2">kind of a like a visual of the 3d space</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.529" end="01:03:54.250" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna make a sculpture of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.900" end="01:03:57.670" style="s2">right shape</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.250" end="01:04:00.760" style="s2">of across those three different if we</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.670" end="01:04:02.470" style="s2">could find the perfect sculpture so like</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.760" end="01:04:05.470" style="s2">the right amount of omniscience and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.470" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">right amount of yeah like something I</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.470" end="01:04:13.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know sorry Tru truly grasping all</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:15.940" style="s2">of that is a lot of work yeah right is</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.690" end="01:04:17.790" style="s2">that it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.940" end="01:04:21.070" style="s2">non-trivial but you know so was</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.790" end="01:04:22.810" style="s2">arithmetic back in the Greek Age right</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.070" end="01:04:24.970" style="s2">yeah yeah sure once once you kind of got</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.810" end="01:04:27.700" style="s2">good at it good at teaching it you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.970" end="01:04:29.110" style="s2">start getting you know third graders to</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.700" end="01:04:31.600" style="s2">do it but right now it&#39;s not their grade</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.110" end="01:04:33.400" style="s2">level it&#39;s a lot of work yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.600" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">but the point being is that your insight</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.400" end="01:04:37.750" style="s2">is right like okay yes it&#39;s all three</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:38.740" style="s2">it&#39;s those three different elements in</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.750" end="01:04:42.190" style="s2">this elements brought into right</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.740" end="01:04:43.270" style="s2">relationship both statically and</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.190" end="01:04:45.580" style="s2">dynamically so there&#39;s a right</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.270" end="01:04:47.080" style="s2">relationship in in in a moment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.580" end="01:04:51.240" style="s2">also revelation ship and how the process</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.080" end="01:04:55.720" style="s2">of dynamic evolution and homeostatic</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.240" end="01:04:57.310" style="s2">continuation how that plays out yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.720" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.310" end="01:05:01.090" style="s2">that&#39;s what this kind of a village would</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:03.520" style="s2">be looking like is they would yes it</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.090" end="01:05:05.950" style="s2">would actually have a feeling of the of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.520" end="01:05:07.600" style="s2">the monastery it have a feeling of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.950" end="01:05:09.670" style="s2">hippie community and have a feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.600" end="01:05:12.930" style="s2">the Googleplex exactly where each of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.670" end="01:05:12.930" style="s2">those aspects as good as most needed</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.590" end="01:05:21.480" style="s2">yeah and that would be as you can see</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.450" end="01:05:26.410" style="s2">the monastery lacks Googleplex yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.480" end="01:05:27.430" style="s2">yeah right it lacks women typically you</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.410" end="01:05:29.050" style="s2">don&#39;t have women in children you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.430" end="01:05:31.000" style="s2">really have an enduring culture you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.050" end="01:05:33.220" style="s2">got something which is a you know a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.000" end="01:05:35.320" style="s2">specific subdomain like a parent site at</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.220" end="01:05:37.210" style="s2">the end of the day is powerful and</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.320" end="01:05:40.030" style="s2">important by the way monasteries have</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.210" end="01:05:41.980" style="s2">been in maintaining a lot of the core</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.030" end="01:05:44.310" style="s2">essence of game be it&#39;s over long</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.980" end="01:05:47.770" style="s2">periods of time and in significant</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.310" end="01:05:49.060" style="s2">through bad periods and of course we</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.770" end="01:05:55.180" style="s2">know the hippie commune with a lack is</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.060" end="01:05:57.490" style="s2">they lack simultaneously a true friend</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.180" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">Cendant connection to something that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.490" end="01:06:06.390" style="s2">beyond themselves they tend to become</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:06.390" style="s2">too hedonistic reality-based</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.820" end="01:06:12.330" style="s2">choice-making on a frontier of up</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.740" end="01:06:13.940" style="s2">gradient capacity so they tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.330" end="01:06:17.340" style="s2">sort of uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.940" end="01:06:21.260" style="s2">what&#39;s that called return to nature</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.340" end="01:06:24.360" style="s2">identic is i can any Zdenek utopianism</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.260" end="01:06:25.350" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t work because what the very</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.360" end="01:06:26.520" style="s2">least he doesn&#39;t work because a million</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.350" end="01:06:29.610" style="s2">people can&#39;t live a need in a key to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.520" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">open ism we did that and that had about</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.610" end="01:06:37.140" style="s2">a billion people in it yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that you had another</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.140" end="01:06:40.950" style="s2">another piece of pushback that i wanted</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:50.640" style="s2">to respond to because i thought was very</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.950" end="01:06:53.850" style="s2">good i&#39;ve lost it so there was the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.640" end="01:06:55.320" style="s2">initial contract being flexible but I</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.850" end="01:06:57.120" style="s2">suppose you&#39;ve kind of answered that in</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.320" end="01:06:59.460" style="s2">one sense by making the the value</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.120" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">proposition which is you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.460" end="01:07:06.800" style="s2">amount that people will gain should</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:09.420" style="s2">hopefully be enough to attract them but</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.800" end="01:07:17.210" style="s2">I&#39;m still wondering because people cuz</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.420" end="01:07:17.210" style="s2">game a is a trap right yeah and like</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.490" end="01:07:24.330" style="s2">some wave I suppose suppose that could</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.350" end="01:07:26.370" style="s2">be you could manage that by inviting</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.330" end="01:07:28.230" style="s2">people to come and visit it you could</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.370" end="01:07:30.390" style="s2">you could be doing and sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.230" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">thinking out loud of it here you could</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.390" end="01:07:34.320" style="s2">be go ahead yep so just in terms of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:36.210" style="s2">value proposition and making it flexible</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.320" end="01:07:40.200" style="s2">as well it&#39;s just making sure that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.210" end="01:07:41.550" style="s2">this stuff going on that&#39;s public not to</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.200" end="01:07:42.360" style="s2">public that it&#39;s gonna be bringing too</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.550" end="01:07:44.250" style="s2">much attention</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.360" end="01:07:45.420" style="s2">ah that&#39;s oh you&#39;re bringing out you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.250" end="01:07:48.840" style="s2">bringing out the risk the risk of either</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.420" end="01:07:51.540" style="s2">attacker co-optation right yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.840" end="01:07:52.500" style="s2">broadly speaking I agree we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.540" end="01:07:54.060" style="s2">discovered that we actually have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.500" end="01:07:56.730" style="s2">really interesting advantage and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.060" end="01:07:57.630" style="s2">almost like what&#39;s this called like</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.730" end="01:07:59.880" style="s2">passive</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.630" end="01:08:01.800" style="s2">camouflage in the animal world mm-hm</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.880" end="01:08:04.890" style="s2">gamy really doesn&#39;t understand what the</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.800" end="01:08:06.360" style="s2">hell I&#39;m talking about yeah it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.890" end="01:08:09.390" style="s2">like I could I could stand in front of</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.360" end="01:08:11.250" style="s2">somebody who okay I could just go into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.390" end="01:08:12.810" style="s2">boardroom and then it&#39;s act have and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.250" end="01:08:15.319" style="s2">begin the process of having this</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.810" end="01:08:17.580" style="s2">conversation and some combination of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.319" end="01:08:21.619" style="s2">either I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.580" end="01:08:24.589" style="s2">I&#39;m completely naive I&#39;m lying</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.619" end="01:08:26.270" style="s2">I&#39;m a commie whatever it is right it</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.589" end="01:08:28.790" style="s2">will tend to not reject it in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.270" end="01:08:30.139" style="s2">direction of oh that&#39;s really actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.790" end="01:08:31.609" style="s2">dangerous and therefore I need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.139" end="01:08:33.830" style="s2">cooperate destroy it right now but more</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.609" end="01:08:36.230" style="s2">than the direction of not to be paid</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.830" end="01:08:38.210" style="s2">attention to which is a really odd thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.230" end="01:08:39.560" style="s2">like it&#39;s more it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.210" end="01:08:42.560" style="s2">invisible it&#39;s almost like game B is</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.560" end="01:08:45.139" style="s2">intrinsically invisible to game a thus</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.560" end="01:08:46.849" style="s2">far and that said there is a point at</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.139" end="01:08:49.609" style="s2">which I imagine that would change so</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.849" end="01:08:51.349" style="s2">maybe needs to be on a steep exponent so</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.609" end="01:08:54.349" style="s2">that by the time it shows up to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.349" end="01:08:55.940" style="s2">brainstem no no but they think of game a</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.349" end="01:08:58.639" style="s2">gaming is that dinosaur that famous</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.940" end="01:08:59.869" style="s2">dinosaur where you know I can hit it in</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.639" end="01:09:04.069" style="s2">the tail and the brain wouldn&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.869" end="01:09:06.710" style="s2">for like ten minutes yeah so by the time</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.069" end="01:09:08.989" style="s2">the dinosaur is feeling the teeth in its</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.710" end="01:09:13.730" style="s2">rump well that actually is aware of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.989" end="01:09:16.759" style="s2">in its brain it&#39;s to eight exponential</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.730" end="01:09:18.259" style="s2">that needs to be a steep exponential and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.759" end="01:09:21.020" style="s2">this is why by the way in my in my own</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.259" end="01:09:22.580" style="s2">work I tend to focus on the components</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.020" end="01:09:27.369" style="s2">and getting the raw components together</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.580" end="01:09:29.690" style="s2">right like it&#39;s effective coherent</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.369" end="01:09:32.119" style="s2">creative collaboration there&#39;s new form</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.690" end="01:09:34.040" style="s2">of collective intelligence and being</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.119" end="01:09:37.339" style="s2">able to scale it past certain critical</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.040" end="01:09:41.020" style="s2">thresholds like if you if you get that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.339" end="01:09:43.279" style="s2">right because that core code right then</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.020" end="01:09:47.080" style="s2">implement it you begin to actually do it</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.279" end="01:09:47.080" style="s2">you begin to use it and to scale it</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.230" end="01:09:52.009" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of thing that can they</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.190" end="01:09:53.420" style="s2">can move very quickly and if it&#39;s scales</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.009" end="01:09:55.130" style="s2">whether that means is that it&#39;s stable</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.420" end="01:09:57.560" style="s2">as more energy is put into it it does</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.130" end="01:09:59.270" style="s2">not break with a million people for</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.560" end="01:10:01.040" style="s2">example you use oh we schedule</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.270" end="01:10:02.119" style="s2">million people now it doesn&#39;t work at</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.040" end="01:10:03.860" style="s2">all if that&#39;s what you want to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.119" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s the kind of thing that once</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.860" end="01:10:07.730" style="s2">you get past some minimum threshold game</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:09.349" style="s2">on like it has to go all the way to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.730" end="01:10:10.670" style="s2">end without breaking so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.349" end="01:10:14.300" style="s2">important to actually get the design</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.670" end="01:10:15.800" style="s2">work right I know a lot of folks with</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.300" end="01:10:17.389" style="s2">variety of different biases tend to</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.800" end="01:10:20.630" style="s2">critique the game be effort for being</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.389" end="01:10:22.280" style="s2">too conceptual but it&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.630" end="01:10:24.469" style="s2">about design than it is concept it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.280" end="01:10:26.030" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a design approach like how</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.469" end="01:10:27.710" style="s2">do we actually make sure that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.030" end="01:10:28.969" style="s2">thinking very clearly about all the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.710" end="01:10:32.060" style="s2">various steps that need to be in place</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.969" end="01:10:33.349" style="s2">for to actually work and and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.060" end="01:10:35.190" style="s2">actually designed with real precision</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.349" end="01:10:37.140" style="s2">the elements that must be in place</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.190" end="01:10:38.400" style="s2">to be able to to blow all the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.140" end="01:10:40.680" style="s2">through the objections let&#39;s think about</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.400" end="01:10:42.330" style="s2">the objections well in advance and not</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.680" end="01:10:44.310" style="s2">necessarily discover them in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.330" end="01:10:47.370" style="s2">yes we&#39;ve made a terrible design in his</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.310" end="01:10:48.660" style="s2"> because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.370" end="01:10:50.670" style="s2">specific lien it&#39;s like you know landing</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.660" end="01:10:52.470" style="s2">somebody on the moon you design that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.670" end="01:10:54.480" style="s2">that ship with a lot of precision</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.470" end="01:10:56.760" style="s2">because once it&#39;s in space</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.480" end="01:11:02.670" style="s2">you better got it right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.760" end="01:11:04.740" style="s2">it&#39;s got a lot like that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.670" end="01:11:08.310" style="s2">rightfully so though for exactly all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.740" end="01:11:09.870" style="s2">reasons you&#39;ve just said you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.310" end="01:11:12.410" style="s2">and just it just to say then my own</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.870" end="01:11:15.540" style="s2">lived experience is that we still have</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.410" end="01:11:18.690" style="s2">way too much game a habit so we tend to</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.540" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">cut corners take shortcuts or project</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.690" end="01:11:23.820" style="s2">gaming models to solve problems and my</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:26.610" style="s2">lived experience is that every time I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.820" end="01:11:29.370" style="s2">done that it is in fact kicked me in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.610" end="01:11:30.750" style="s2">ass so I&#39;m like okay I get it I get it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.370" end="01:11:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna work this there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.750" end="01:11:34.080" style="s2">reasons where I can&#39;t I&#39;m not just like</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.640" end="01:11:35.010" style="s2">get punched in the face and then okay I</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.080" end="01:11:36.810" style="s2">don&#39;t get punched in the face I get</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.010" end="01:11:38.070" style="s2">punched face like okay why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.810" end="01:11:40.170" style="s2">skip punched in the face what just</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.070" end="01:11:41.910" style="s2">happened there oh okay here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.170" end="01:11:43.800" style="s2">underlying basis for why this picture</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.910" end="01:11:45.330" style="s2">coverage doesn&#39;t work okay now I just</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.800" end="01:11:47.340" style="s2">got kicked in the balls the hell just</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.330" end="01:11:48.600" style="s2">happened there oh here&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.340" end="01:11:49.770" style="s2">underlying basis but if I think about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.600" end="01:11:52.290" style="s2">they&#39;re actually both tied it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.770" end="01:11:53.820" style="s2">thing which is more or less stop using</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.290" end="01:11:58.680" style="s2">gay made tools with all these problems</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.820" end="01:12:01.320" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah so the next big thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.680" end="01:12:03.150" style="s2">coming up for me and I&#39;m aware of time</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.320" end="01:12:04.590" style="s2">so maybe we&#39;re getting close we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.150" end="01:12:08.460" style="s2">getting close to the end yeah we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.590" end="01:12:10.460" style="s2">park we can park this but how that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.460" end="01:12:15.570" style="s2">next thing that&#39;s the next thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.460" end="01:12:17.160" style="s2">how proof well I assure you that if I</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.570" end="01:12:21.930" style="s2">knew the answer that I&#39;d have been done</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.160" end="01:12:23.400" style="s2">long ago Yeah right and it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.930" end="01:12:26.130" style="s2">because I actually am able to now</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.400" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">explain why I don&#39;t know the answer any</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.130" end="01:12:30.450" style="s2">kind of gesture in the direction of how</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:32.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s a good thing okay because it</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.450" end="01:12:34.490" style="s2">has to do with the same exact thing that</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.160" end="01:12:36.990" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about of innovations</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.490" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">in innovation is a mystery the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.990" end="01:12:40.920" style="s2">that this is a mysteries that have done</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:42.960" style="s2">a puzzle it&#39;s a mystery so the how is</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.920" end="01:12:45.840" style="s2">actually building our skillfulness our</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.960" end="01:12:48.940" style="s2">embodied skills our actual practical</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.840" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">wisdom in navigating mystery</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.940" end="01:12:51.730" style="s2">is a really weird thing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:54.910" style="s2">recursive because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.730" end="01:12:56.410" style="s2">underlying essence of what it means to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.910" end="01:12:58.060" style="s2">game be again d player is actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.410" end="01:13:01.540" style="s2">increasing skillfulness in navigating</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.060" end="01:13:03.880" style="s2">mystery so it&#39;s weird like to catalyser</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.540" end="01:13:05.199" style="s2">to move game b forward as the mystery so</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.880" end="01:13:06.489" style="s2">to begin to do that one of the things we</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.199" end="01:13:08.050" style="s2">have to do is we have to increase our</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.489" end="01:13:09.820" style="s2">individual collective capacity at</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.050" end="01:13:12.580" style="s2">navigating mystery like how to increase</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.820" end="01:13:14.710" style="s2">our intuitive sense how do we increase</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.580" end="01:13:16.150" style="s2">our ability to perceive that which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.710" end="01:13:17.620" style="s2">just right around the corner that we</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.150" end="01:13:19.630" style="s2">can&#39;t quite grasp with the mind that we</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.620" end="01:13:21.100" style="s2">have but it&#39;s real enough that we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.630" end="01:13:23.020" style="s2">begin the process of understanding how</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.100" end="01:13:25.239" style="s2">to build the kind of mental constructs</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.020" end="01:13:28.300" style="s2">the could grasp it without making it up</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.239" end="01:13:29.830" style="s2">them wouldn&#39;t know what it is this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.300" end="01:13:31.630" style="s2">real stuff like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not made</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.830" end="01:13:35.140" style="s2">out like we&#39;ve done this as humans many</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.630" end="01:13:38.440" style="s2">different times or this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.140" end="01:13:41.020" style="s2">many different times and it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.440" end="01:13:43.210" style="s2">it&#39;s out of that order and what&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.020" end="01:13:44.350" style="s2">though this is why I kind of always get</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.210" end="01:13:49.449" style="s2">confused so almost like topsy-turvy</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.350" end="01:13:51.130" style="s2">which is in some sense getting past a</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.449" end="01:13:54.280" style="s2">certain critical mass getting past a</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.130" end="01:13:56.650" style="s2">certain level of individual and</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.280" end="01:14:02.650" style="s2">collective skillfulness and being able</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.650" end="01:14:06.160" style="s2">to navigate the mystery is is all there</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.650" end="01:14:09.310" style="s2">is because once you&#39;ve done that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.160" end="01:14:12.610" style="s2">now in it you know the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.310" end="01:14:18.040" style="s2">racing into it&#39;s it&#39;s already landed on</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.610" end="01:14:19.570" style="s2">the moon it&#39;s very weird that there will</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.040" end="01:14:20.949" style="s2">obviously be actual real material things</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.570" end="01:14:23.469" style="s2">that will actually build in our</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.949" end="01:14:25.930" style="s2">technology would build actual ships to</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.469" end="01:14:27.580" style="s2">space will build villages but will now</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.930" end="01:14:30.070" style="s2">be doing it in a context where the</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.580" end="01:14:32.650" style="s2">capacity to do it right and well has</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.070" end="01:14:34.930" style="s2">already been embodied has already been</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.650" end="01:14:38.080" style="s2">done and I think that embodiment feels</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.930" end="01:14:39.430" style="s2">feels right and if I&#39;m getting that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.080" end="01:14:41.560" style="s2">your train of thought here which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.430" end="01:14:44.920" style="s2">actually we&#39;re working on ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.560" end="01:14:47.739" style="s2">right now it&#39;s it&#39;s like yeah each other</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.920" end="01:14:49.780" style="s2">and each other of course yes is right so</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.739" end="01:14:51.330" style="s2">there&#39;s this yeah that&#39;s what it links</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.780" end="01:14:56.710" style="s2">with your religion not religion stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.330" end="01:14:59.550" style="s2">with with with Johnny V or everybody</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.710" end="01:14:59.550" style="s2">said I was good</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.270" end="01:15:04.739" style="s2">which is that kind of what other</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.210" end="01:15:08.310" style="s2">practices that are going to get as their</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.739" end="01:15:10.320" style="s2">what do we need to do like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.310" end="01:15:12.270" style="s2">going to meditate how do we meditate if</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.320" end="01:15:14.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to meditate we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.270" end="01:15:16.260" style="s2">it alongside a bunch of other things you</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.160" end="01:15:19.110" style="s2">know what are those things um I suppose</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.260" end="01:15:22.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the focus isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.110" end="01:15:23.969" style="s2">right it&#39;s yeah how do we make how do we</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.230" end="01:15:27.000" style="s2">make how do we do this bizarre thing of</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.969" end="01:15:29.250" style="s2">making effective choices without a</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.000" end="01:15:35.010" style="s2">rulebook telling us where Twitter is to</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.250" end="01:15:36.180" style="s2">make which is called wisdom mm-hmm that</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.010" end="01:15:40.770" style="s2">would become wise that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.180" end="01:15:43.560" style="s2">saying it yeah yeah and yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.770" end="01:15:46.730" style="s2">we&#39;re back into the sovereignty thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.560" end="01:15:50.150" style="s2">aren&#39;t we and they have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.730" end="01:15:55.500" style="s2">use all of our senses</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.150" end="01:15:57.989" style="s2">organs whatever they may be to find out</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.500" end="01:16:02.450" style="s2">what the next best step is and then take</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.989" end="01:16:04.380" style="s2">it yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.450" end="01:16:06.900" style="s2">humility is another good pill to take</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.380" end="01:16:08.430" style="s2">every day yeah right right because I</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.900" end="01:16:09.960" style="s2">mean what came up for me is we were</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.430" end="01:16:11.760" style="s2">having this conversation was all right</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.960" end="01:16:14.340" style="s2">so now I need to come buy a piece of</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.760" end="01:16:16.020" style="s2">land I need to settle this thing but</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.340" end="01:16:18.989" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is I said whoa whoa</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.020" end="01:16:20.910" style="s2">whoa whoa like just chill a bit you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.989" end="01:16:26.219" style="s2">that&#39;s the impression I&#39;m game which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.910" end="01:16:30.239" style="s2">like do the work first like on you</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.219" end="01:16:33.300" style="s2">before you run away and start throwing</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.239" end="01:16:36.780" style="s2">money is that what you&#39;re saying or well</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.300" end="01:16:39.020" style="s2">more or less I mean yes right if I had</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.780" end="01:16:42.210" style="s2">to have it</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.020" end="01:16:43.469" style="s2">that would be the simplest version but</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.210" end="01:16:45.390" style="s2">this isn&#39;t really to say don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.469" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">agency it&#39;s just to say to just remember</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.390" end="01:16:49.530" style="s2">that most of what you&#39;ll be doing in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:52.110" style="s2">object which we will be doing in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.530" end="01:16:53.700" style="s2">kind of in the do it really needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.110" end="01:16:55.200" style="s2">seen as experiment it really needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.700" end="01:16:57.300" style="s2">seen as prototyping and testing and</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.200" end="01:16:58.860" style="s2">feeling like we we don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.300" end="01:17:01.350" style="s2">build those villains who just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.860" end="01:17:02.219" style="s2">we have any idea yeah but some people</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.350" end="01:17:03.960" style="s2">are going to have to start running</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.219" end="01:17:04.890" style="s2">experiments trying to do different kinds</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.960" end="01:17:07.320" style="s2">of things some people don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.890" end="01:17:10.560" style="s2">start you know building the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.320" end="01:17:12.480" style="s2">new R&amp;D kind of organization and we will</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.560" end="01:17:13.949" style="s2">learn what works and where doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.480" end="01:17:18.810" style="s2">Larr as much</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.949" end="01:17:20.429" style="s2">I doing it and failing feeling well like</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.810" end="01:17:22.800" style="s2">failing in an interesting way feeling in</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.429" end="01:17:25.260" style="s2">a direction this forward yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.800" end="01:17:27.510" style="s2">as we will by getting clear precision</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.260" end="01:17:29.820" style="s2">and more better principles of design</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.510" end="01:17:31.170" style="s2">that help us prune experiments that just</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.820" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">won&#39;t work at all and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.170" end="01:17:35.070" style="s2">that&#39;s the combination so yeah work on</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:36.570" style="s2">yourself make yourself a vessel and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.070" end="01:17:39.330" style="s2">vehicle that is more and more capable of</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.570" end="01:17:42.650" style="s2">entering into coherence with other</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.330" end="01:17:45.420" style="s2">people then seek out those particular</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.650" end="01:17:46.830" style="s2">experiments that seem most likely most</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.420" end="01:17:49.050" style="s2">like the one that you are here to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.830" end="01:17:50.820" style="s2">like what there&#39;s lost and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.050" end="01:17:52.080" style="s2">obvious strategy there&#39;s no obvious ones</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.820" end="01:17:54.989" style="s2">that are more important than others so</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.080" end="01:17:56.460" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re in most call all do and</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.989" end="01:17:57.660" style="s2">whatever your coherence like if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.460" end="01:17:59.010" style="s2">other people around you throw very</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.660" end="01:18:00.630" style="s2">connecting with and that connected group</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.010" end="01:18:03.060" style="s2">has a feeling of a particular experiment</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.630" end="01:18:04.260" style="s2">that goes like there&#39;s a dude do</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.060" end="01:18:07.140" style="s2">that but recognize you&#39;re doing an</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.260" end="01:18:09.000" style="s2">experiment so loop go in come back out</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.140" end="01:18:10.650" style="s2">look around talk to people or make apart</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.000" end="01:18:12.480" style="s2">your groups see you know cross fertilize</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.650" end="01:18:15.560" style="s2">come back in run another loop like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.480" end="01:18:19.140" style="s2">kind of thing like a living process of</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.560" end="01:18:20.850" style="s2">learning doing growing that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.140" end="01:18:22.560" style="s2">thing is that&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.850" end="01:18:24.510" style="s2">experiment Vaska witty make this thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.560" end="01:18:29.420" style="s2">move forward building wisdom that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.510" end="01:18:32.160" style="s2">you build wisdom great yep all right</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.420" end="01:18:35.310" style="s2">thank you so much pushback I love that</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.160" end="01:18:38.520" style="s2">that&#39;s all right that&#39;s okay any time if</p>
