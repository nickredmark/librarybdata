<p begin="00:04:14.599" end="00:04:21.709" style="s2">make clear to you from the inside so to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.329" end="00:04:24.530" style="s2">speak what gnosis is and how you are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.709" end="00:04:26.449" style="s2">probably at some point seeking it or</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.530" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">will be seeking it or have sought it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.449" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">your life and then once we get this</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:38.419" style="s2">existential understanding of what gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.530" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">is then through that lens I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.419" end="00:04:40.790" style="s2">more appropriate to try and understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">the history</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.790" end="00:04:46.760" style="s2">Oracle figures the the Gnostics are sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:49.250" style="s2">of I don&#39;t know what to say sexy hot</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.760" end="00:04:52.550" style="s2">right now a lot of conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.250" end="00:04:56.110" style="s2">and Dan Brown kind of crap around all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.550" end="00:04:59.380" style="s2">this and I think that&#39;s the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.110" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t really understand the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.380" end="00:05:06.920" style="s2">right as a movement unless you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">understand what gnosis is itself this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.920" end="00:05:11.450" style="s2">going to turn out to be important</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.270" end="00:05:13.160" style="s2">because I think a way we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.450" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">the Gnostics is they are the axial</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.160" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">revolution within the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">they are the attempt to take the axial</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:25.040" style="s2">revolution to its culmination to its</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:29.570" style="s2">rational culmination and they are going</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.040" end="00:05:33.050" style="s2">to provide the undercurrent to Western</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.570" end="00:05:37.250" style="s2">cultures understanding of its spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.050" end="00:05:38.540" style="s2">history and direction so for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.250" end="00:05:40.670" style="s2">you won&#39;t hear me talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.540" end="00:05:41.750" style="s2">Gnostics because like I did when I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.670" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">talking about the Buddha&#39;s enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.750" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">and we did a lot of cognitive science on</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:49.130" style="s2">higher states of consciousness I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:51.140" style="s2">try and do some significant cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.130" end="00:05:54.380" style="s2">science before we turn back to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.140" end="00:05:56.780" style="s2">history so let&#39;s let&#39;s get let&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.380" end="00:05:58.700" style="s2">work our way into what this is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.780" end="00:06:00.430" style="s2">already got some sense of what this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.700" end="00:06:02.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a lot of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.430" end="00:06:04.910" style="s2">participatory knowing and perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.630" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">knowing and gnosis has both of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.910" end="00:06:08.420" style="s2">elements in it of transformative</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:10.580" style="s2">experience we&#39;re gonna up try and draw</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.420" end="00:06:14.660" style="s2">this all together but let&#39;s work our way</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.580" end="00:06:18.620" style="s2">into this so we&#39;ve talked about a world</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.660" end="00:06:21.320" style="s2">view and a world view is when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.620" end="00:06:23.210" style="s2">way you have this deeply integrate a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.320" end="00:06:25.820" style="s2">dynamically coupled way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:27.620" style="s2">yourself your agency and seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.820" end="00:06:29.270" style="s2">world as an arena you have this</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.620" end="00:06:31.310" style="s2">bi-directional modeling it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.270" end="00:06:33.590" style="s2">simultaneously modeling the world to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:36.550" style="s2">and modeling you to shape the world this</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.590" end="00:06:42.460" style="s2">mutual conformity this reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.550" end="00:06:42.460" style="s2">revelation right so that&#39;s a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.520" end="00:06:47.270" style="s2">now this has happened to me and I hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.650" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">something similar has happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.270" end="00:06:52.130" style="s2">perhaps when you&#39;re reading a book a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:53.880" style="s2">novel or all you as an example I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.130" end="00:06:59.240" style="s2">reading the works of Appetit</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.880" end="00:07:02.610" style="s2">philosopher let&#39;s say it&#39;s Spinoza right</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.240" end="00:07:04.470" style="s2">and I&#39;ll be reading and I&#39;ll you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.610" end="00:07:06.090" style="s2">and Spinoza&#39;s are profound and deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.470" end="00:07:08.520" style="s2">thinker and you spend a lot of time and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.090" end="00:07:10.620" style="s2">you&#39;re reading the arguments and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.520" end="00:07:13.650" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to understand and you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.620" end="00:07:15.810" style="s2">come to follow the arguments you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.650" end="00:07:18.420" style="s2">come to follow the inferences you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.810" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">even come to believe some of Spinoza&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.420" end="00:07:23.850" style="s2">conclusions and so you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">beliefs and they&#39;re not they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.850" end="00:07:30.540" style="s2">have to be inchoate they can be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:33.660" style="s2">systematically related together but then</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.540" end="00:07:36.420" style="s2">something else happens sometimes not</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.660" end="00:07:39.150" style="s2">always but it&#39;s happened to me multiple</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.420" end="00:07:42.600" style="s2">occasions and it&#39;s often what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.150" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2">to convey above beyond what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.600" end="00:07:46.710" style="s2">what I&#39;m teaching other people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">reading Spinoza and there&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.710" end="00:07:56.460" style="s2">there&#39;s this change I go from seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:08:02.510" style="s2">what Spinoza is saying to seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.460" end="00:08:05.670" style="s2">the way Spinoza says that&#39;s a like right</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.510" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">but knows it goes from something I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.670" end="00:08:09.600" style="s2">know I believe but Spinoza is saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:13.170" style="s2">that and they&#39;re and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.600" end="00:08:15.330" style="s2">about the world and about right about</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.440" end="00:11:00.740" style="s2">we pay attention in such a way that our</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:20.819" style="s2">let&#39;s use Murdock&#39;s particular example</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.629" end="00:11:32.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a mother-in-law she has a she</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.120" end="00:11:34.269" style="s2">has a son the son is married to a woman</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.230" end="00:11:35.889" style="s2">and she doesn&#39;t like this woman the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.269" end="00:11:38.170" style="s2">mother-in-law doesn&#39;t like the woman</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.889" end="00:11:41.649" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously the mother-in-law to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.170" end="00:11:46.540" style="s2">daughter-in-law she doesn&#39;t like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.649" end="00:11:54.389" style="s2">woman because she finds her course finds</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.540" end="00:11:54.389" style="s2">are loud and finds her kind of uncouth</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.170" end="00:12:05.189" style="s2">therefore beneath the sort of elegance</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.060" end="00:12:08.379" style="s2">and dignity of her son and then and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.189" end="00:12:10.029" style="s2">think about agape and forgiving here</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.379" end="00:12:12.610" style="s2">think about it got be unforgiving but</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.029" end="00:12:16.029" style="s2">what happens here at some point Murdock</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.610" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">says and it happens like an insight it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.029" end="00:12:21.339" style="s2">happens like when you come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:25.990" style="s2">nine dot problem the mother now realizes</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.339" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">something now and Murdock is clear about</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.990" end="00:12:29.949" style="s2">this it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a normal</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:32.529" style="s2">insight like in a normal insight we</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.949" end="00:12:36.850" style="s2">refrain how we&#39;re looking at something i</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.529" end="00:12:38.699" style="s2">reframe how i look at the nine dots but</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.850" end="00:12:42.339" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.699" end="00:12:45.490" style="s2">mother-in-law is having a bi-directional</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.339" end="00:12:47.439" style="s2">insight she&#39;s not only reframing how she</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.490" end="00:12:49.870" style="s2">sees the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.439" end="00:12:52.379" style="s2">she&#39;s reframing how she sees herself and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:54.610" style="s2">these are happening in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.379" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">interfused manner this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.610" end="00:13:00.309" style="s2">participatory change the agent are both</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">the agent and the arena side of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:14.019" style="s2">together so it&#39;s not a reframing of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.319" end="00:13:17.379" style="s2">or that I often use this term it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.019" end="00:13:19.420" style="s2">trans framing it&#39;s not a reframing of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.379" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">particular problem it&#39;s a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:24.220" style="s2">of the whole framing process both ends</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:26.319" style="s2">because what&#39;s happening is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.220" end="00:13:28.870" style="s2">mother-in-law is seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.319" end="00:13:29.470" style="s2">daughter-in-law not as course but as</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.470" end="00:13:36.820" style="s2">not as uncouth but sincere not as</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.820" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">authenticity and then she&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.750" end="00:13:52.980" style="s2">habitually has been wrong she&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.820" end="00:13:55.510" style="s2">what we&#39;ve talked about before that</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.510" end="00:14:01.450" style="s2">here and here but there&#39;s a whole system</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.270" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">of errors that she&#39;s transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.450" end="00:14:04.690" style="s2">she&#39;s transforming she&#39;s going through</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">that kind of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.690" end="00:14:10.180" style="s2">transformation that we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:12.550" style="s2">right calls this sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.180" end="00:14:16.660" style="s2">transcendence because what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.550" end="00:14:19.720" style="s2">simultaneously is right the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.660" end="00:14:21.190" style="s2">daughter-in-law can be something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.720" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">she couldn&#39;t be before and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.190" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">mother-in-law is becoming somebody she</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:28.990" style="s2">couldn&#39;t become before she couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:32.140" style="s2">before these two things are happening</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.990" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">together her sensibility her whole way</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.140" end="00:14:39.840" style="s2">of participating in a worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:42.880" style="s2">agent arena relationship is being</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.840" end="00:14:45.220" style="s2">transformed and so both things are going</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.880" end="00:14:48.430" style="s2">through transcendence do you see this</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.220" end="00:14:51.700" style="s2">here&#39;s her self and here&#39;s right the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.430" end="00:14:55.180" style="s2">daughter the object of her attention and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.700" end="00:14:57.790" style="s2">this is going through self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.180" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">but so is this and that&#39;s happening in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.790" end="00:15:05.110" style="s2">completely conjoined way the mother</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:09.610" style="s2">right the mother-in-law is becoming what</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:19.630" style="s2">because she&#39;s coming - right see have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.740" end="00:15:21.610" style="s2">radical insight into what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.630" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">daughter-in-law could be right</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.320" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">there&#39;s knowing by loving it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:48.260" style="s2">notice what&#39;s happening here there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.880" end="00:15:50.180" style="s2">way right you can see that I can I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.260" end="00:15:53.210" style="s2">go through a process like this and enter</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.180" end="00:15:55.010" style="s2">into a world view and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.210" end="00:15:57.200" style="s2">what Christianity was offering right it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.010" end="00:15:59.630" style="s2">was offering people that metanoia of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.200" end="00:16:02.150" style="s2">they can go through this radical</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.630" end="00:16:08.440" style="s2">transformation in this way opening up</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.150" end="00:16:11.900" style="s2">the world opening up themselves etc now</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.440" end="00:16:15.800" style="s2">why is that important because now I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.900" end="00:16:18.590" style="s2">you to think of the opposite your</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.230" end="00:16:32.660" style="s2">again somebody we&#39;ve spoken before Harry</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.640" end="00:16:48.200" style="s2">much our reasoning depends on what we</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.850" end="00:17:01.340" style="s2">he brings up a notion he calls I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:03.020" style="s2">quite like this word but to be fair to</p>

<p begin="00:17:03.020" end="00:17:14.020" style="s2">calls the unthinkable so let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.890" end="00:17:14.020" style="s2">an example of this so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.220" end="00:17:20.750" style="s2">the way to think of the unthinkable is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.910" end="00:17:23.460" style="s2">although you can make thoughts images</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.750" end="00:17:26.010" style="s2">propositions run inferences you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.460" end="00:17:27.810" style="s2">actually make it viable you can&#39;t go</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.810" end="00:17:38.700" style="s2">that would bring you into living that</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:44.790" style="s2">this has been such a blessing for me I</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.790" end="00:17:51.510" style="s2">him as right as he&#39;s building his career</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.270" end="00:17:53.190" style="s2">right now I can think this thought it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.510" end="00:17:54.800" style="s2">would be great if I kicked Jason out I</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.190" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">can run this thought through my head</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.800" end="00:17:59.610" style="s2">because if I did then the apartment</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.710" style="s2">would be clean I&#39;d have more money I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.610" end="00:18:04.920" style="s2">draw I can imagine what it would look</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.710" end="00:18:10.020" style="s2">like I can run the thought right I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.920" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">draw drive all the inferences but what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.020" end="00:18:16.170" style="s2">can&#39;t do is actually make this a viable</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">alternative for me it&#39;s in that way the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.170" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">thought it&#39;s unthinkable to me my love</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:24.030" style="s2">for my son doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:28.070" style="s2">these thoughts imagine these scenes draw</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:32.070" style="s2">these inferences I can do all of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.070" end="00:18:33.420" style="s2">what I can&#39;t do is bring myself to live</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.070" end="00:18:37.650" style="s2">in that world</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.420" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">it&#39;s unthinkable to me perhaps a better</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.650" end="00:18:44.030" style="s2">way of thinking about it is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:47.640" style="s2">not viable to me it&#39;s unlivable for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.030" end="00:18:52.110" style="s2">now that&#39;s a good thing right so do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.640" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">see how I have a way right a sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.110" end="00:18:59.220" style="s2">transcendence with my son that means</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:19:01.320" style="s2">there&#39;s no effort on my part to treat</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.220" end="00:19:03.030" style="s2">him morally and I&#39;m not trying to be</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.030" end="00:19:09.060" style="s2">say is right doing that thing of kicking</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.770" end="00:19:15.270" style="s2">him out which I think would ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.060" end="00:19:16.830" style="s2">be an immoral act is not viable to me so</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.270" end="00:19:18.300" style="s2">right now this all sounds this is all</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.830" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">really great but there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.300" end="00:19:24.110" style="s2">this can be twisted now I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:24.110" style="s2">now think of the negative of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.450" end="00:19:36.419" style="s2">all right what is you&#39;re stuck you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.440" end="00:19:42.059" style="s2">stuck in a world view you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.419" end="00:19:49.109" style="s2">be in you want to go over there to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.059" end="00:19:50.820" style="s2">world view but you can&#39;t you can&#39;t go</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.820" end="00:20:01.049" style="s2">that will make that worldview viable to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:20:06.419" style="s2">you because you can run inferences in</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.049" end="00:20:08.850" style="s2">your head you can run imagine scenes you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.419" end="00:20:11.940" style="s2">can state things to yourself you could</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.850" end="00:20:16.440" style="s2">make all kinds of affirmations won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.359" end="00:20:38.999" style="s2">enter therapy for exactly this reason</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.999" end="00:20:45.239" style="s2">and what kind of world they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.279" end="00:20:47.309" style="s2">in they can imagine it they can make</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.309" end="00:20:57.809" style="s2">like if they were there they can deeply</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.230" end="00:22:47.380" style="s2">so one thing that can happen to people</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.210" end="00:22:49.480" style="s2">is they can lose their agency remember</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.380" end="00:22:52.059" style="s2">that&#39;s what suffering means because they</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.870" end="00:23:17.080" style="s2">radical existential inertia Jung used to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.740" end="00:23:21.130" style="s2">often Carl Jung used to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.080" end="00:23:23.110" style="s2">primary thing that people would have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.130" end="00:23:25.029" style="s2">get to and have to express and why they</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.110" end="00:23:29.169" style="s2">would come into therapy was precisely</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.029" end="00:23:30.519" style="s2">because they felt stuck it might not</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.370" end="00:23:51.730" style="s2">and they should be and although they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.279" end="00:23:54.370" style="s2">talk and draw images and make inferences</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.139" end="00:24:17.340" style="s2">therapy has an a gapek element into it</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.419" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">Wow this fruit is so unlike any food</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.760" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever tasted it&#39;s so wonderful I</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:00.130" style="s2">love it</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:01.210" style="s2">or they say this fruit is so unlike any</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.130" end="00:26:05.140" style="s2">food I&#39;ve ever tasted</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.210" end="00:26:08.620" style="s2">I hate it it tastes like vomit and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.140" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">thing is you don&#39;t know which reaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.620" end="00:26:14.230" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have until you bite the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">fruit and she says well do you bite the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.230" end="00:26:25.090" style="s2">fruit and you may say well I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:28.120" style="s2">the point is right you bite the fruit or</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.090" end="00:26:29.530" style="s2">not you&#39;ll typically say well what does</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.120" end="00:26:31.480" style="s2">it matter it&#39;s not there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.530" end="00:26:36.760" style="s2">significantly at risk if I have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.480" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">fruit that&#39;s true but what the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.760" end="00:26:41.200" style="s2">example points to is the following</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:45.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of knowing that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:48.130" style="s2">dependent on your state of being this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.309" end="00:26:50.650" style="s2">your perspective on knowing you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.130" end="00:26:52.360" style="s2">know what it is like coz that&#39;s the core</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.650" end="00:26:54.460" style="s2">of who you don&#39;t know what your salience</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.360" end="00:26:56.040" style="s2">landscape will be like when you eat this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:26:59.559" style="s2">fruit until you have eaten the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.040" end="00:27:01.870" style="s2">there&#39;s no way of knowing that ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.559" end="00:27:04.270" style="s2">time you have to go through the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.870" end="00:27:06.290" style="s2">experience to know what it is like to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.270" end="00:27:10.210" style="s2">have the experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.290" end="00:27:13.070" style="s2">you say okay I can sort of get that so</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.210" end="00:27:15.980" style="s2">right this is kind of what she calls an</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.070" end="00:27:17.960" style="s2">epistemic transformation but she says</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.980" end="00:27:19.250" style="s2">some of the times what we&#39;re confronting</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.960" end="00:27:21.850" style="s2">is something deeper where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.250" end="00:27:26.270" style="s2">confronting personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.850" end="00:27:28.760" style="s2">right this is where what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.270" end="00:27:31.280" style="s2">happening again is knowing not just by</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.760" end="00:27:35.620" style="s2">having a particular perspective this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.280" end="00:27:38.660" style="s2">knowing by having the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.620" end="00:27:40.549" style="s2">relationship radically transformed you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.660" end="00:27:43.309" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.549" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">person in that world because you have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.309" end="00:27:47.799" style="s2">actually be changed and the world has to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:51.950" style="s2">be changed in order for you to have that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.799" end="00:27:54.860" style="s2">participatory knowing so she talks about</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.950" end="00:27:58.010" style="s2">the fact that what she means by like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.860" end="00:28:00.610" style="s2">transformative experience is one in</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.010" end="00:28:03.620" style="s2">which you&#39;re going to undergo that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.610" end="00:28:05.540" style="s2">change in perspective of knowing in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.620" end="00:28:08.870" style="s2">change in participatory note so she</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.540" end="00:28:12.010" style="s2">gives a good Donkin experiment to bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.870" end="00:28:15.770" style="s2">that out first a thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.010" end="00:28:18.919" style="s2">she says imagine the following right she</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.770" end="00:28:21.559" style="s2">said your friends come to you and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.919" end="00:28:25.820" style="s2">revealed a secret they give you just in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.559" end="00:28:28.010" style="s2">like indubitable evidence that they can</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.820" end="00:28:30.230" style="s2">do the following they convince you that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.010" end="00:28:33.830" style="s2">they can absolutely do the following</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.230" end="00:28:40.370" style="s2">they can turn you into a vampire do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.830" end="00:28:42.020" style="s2">do it do you do you become a vampire now</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.370" end="00:28:43.640" style="s2">before you put this off as silly the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.020" end="00:28:46.340" style="s2">point of a philosophical thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.640" end="00:28:48.679" style="s2">experience that is to play with</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.340" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">something free from your own life so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.679" end="00:28:52.669" style="s2">can get clear about it what it means</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">after we&#39;ve played with it we will go</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.669" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">back to our lives but here&#39;s the issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.179" end="00:29:03.860" style="s2">you can&#39;t make any inferences about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:07.250" style="s2">because you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.860" end="00:29:09.710" style="s2">to be like to be a vampire and you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.770" end="00:29:20.150" style="s2">character everything is going to change</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.450" end="00:29:21.470" style="s2">and your salience landscape</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.150" end="00:29:23.300" style="s2">is going to radically change you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.470" end="00:29:26.660" style="s2">know what it&#39;s going to be like so</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.300" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">here&#39;s what you face I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.660" end="00:29:32.840" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna lose if I become a vampire I</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.150" end="00:41:38.770" style="s2">frivolous thing what are the disasters</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.250" end="00:41:42.090" style="s2">of our culture is we think of play as</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.770" end="00:41:42.090" style="s2">only about fun</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.180" end="00:41:49.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve trivialized it now play can be fun</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.750" end="00:41:54.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t think fun is what people are</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.930" end="00:41:56.500" style="s2">after in Jeep form so I&#39;m really fun</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.790" end="00:41:59.940" style="s2">that people are out after when they</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.940" end="00:42:05.890" style="s2">see the word play doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.680" end="00:42:07.690" style="s2">about fun because you can play music and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.890" end="00:42:10.030" style="s2">it could be heartbreaking music it could</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.690" end="00:42:13.120" style="s2">be Mahler that you&#39;re playing in Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.030" end="00:42:13.690" style="s2">you don&#39;t do Tai Chi you play Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.120" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.690" end="00:42:17.950" style="s2">about having fun it&#39;s about a deep</p>

<p begin="00:42:24.010" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">these instances they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:34.020" style="s2">transformative experience and so what</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:37.060" style="s2">they do is they have an inactive analogy</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.020" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">this isn&#39;t an analogy of word or thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.060" end="00:42:40.930" style="s2">because that&#39;s not going to work because</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:43.360" style="s2">this is about perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.930" end="00:42:50.650" style="s2">participatory change this is an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.360" end="00:42:55.270" style="s2">you enact you go through the actions now</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.650" end="00:42:57.430" style="s2">this takes a lot of skill to create an</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.270" end="00:43:03.820" style="s2">inactive analogy it creates a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.430" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">skill I got to get it right all right if</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.820" end="00:43:06.970" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the Jeep form I got to get it</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:14.950" style="s2">role reversal suddenly give me an object</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.340" end="00:43:18.310" style="s2">I got to use right the therapist will</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.950" end="00:43:19.930" style="s2">suddenly get you to talk to that pretend</p>

<p begin="00:43:22.060" end="00:43:30.190" style="s2">got to get it right because the inactive</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.960" end="00:43:32.410" style="s2">analogy has to be similar enough to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.190" end="00:43:34.120" style="s2">world and the person you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.410" end="00:43:37.480" style="s2">become in that world it has to be</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.029" end="00:47:00.099" style="s2">world view so what I need is I need not</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.259" end="00:47:08.229" style="s2">only an inactive analogy I need a way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.099" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">enacting and a gargy and that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.229" end="00:47:13.329" style="s2">what religious ritual used to do for us</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:17.079" style="s2">religious ritual was a way of playing</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.329" end="00:47:19.509" style="s2">with inactive analogies so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.079" end="00:47:24.190" style="s2">compare so I could overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.509" end="00:47:26.349" style="s2">ignorance I can write I can that see</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.190" end="00:47:29.259" style="s2">isn&#39;t even the right verb I can see be</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.349" end="00:47:32.729" style="s2">these two worlds these two ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.259" end="00:47:38.619" style="s2">these two persons within those worlds</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.729" end="00:47:41.529" style="s2">but ritual also was enacted an ACOG a it</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.619" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">was giving you the skills for it knowing</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.529" end="00:47:51.609" style="s2">how to get unstuck how to go through</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">sensibility transcendence how to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.609" end="00:47:56.140" style="s2">that world world viable so in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.959" style="s2">you&#39;re often doing this you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.140" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">people an active analogy okay so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.959" end="00:48:01.989" style="s2">having like it&#39;s coming clear that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:03.640" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck and it has to do with how</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.989" end="00:48:05.319" style="s2">you&#39;re related to your mom okay so</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.469" end="00:48:14.199" style="s2">but it&#39;s not fun it&#39;s not frivolous it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:16.779" style="s2">serious play pretend your mom is there</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.199" end="00:48:20.199" style="s2">enact that get the analogy talk to her</p>
