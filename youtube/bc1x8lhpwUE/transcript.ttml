<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:56.920" style="s2">okay well Melissa I am wondering the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.940" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">right way to begin this because you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.920" end="00:11:01.720" style="s2">a fascinating person and someone who I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.720" end="00:11:06.540" style="s2">enjoyed getting to know you and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.600" end="00:11:10.810" style="s2">you&#39;re doing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.540" end="00:11:15.670" style="s2">that can&#39;t be fully separated from your</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.810" end="00:11:17.560" style="s2">life and your experiences and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.670" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">first part of this conversation I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.560" end="00:11:25.300" style="s2">us to get to Brod places one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:28.510" style="s2">to cover what we can say about what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.300" end="00:11:31.110" style="s2">the latest in psychedelic science can</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.510" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">tell us about the efficacy of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.110" end="00:11:35.710" style="s2">psychedelic assisted therapies and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:38.730" style="s2">perhaps a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.710" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">implications for understanding the brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.730" end="00:11:44.770" style="s2">but I also want to get closer to why it</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:48.190" style="s2">is that you find yourself so impassioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.770" end="00:11:50.050" style="s2">to move this forward in Australia so</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.190" end="00:11:52.570" style="s2">where do you think the right place to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.050" end="00:11:55.180" style="s2">begin is maybe I&#39;ll start with a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.570" end="00:11:58.120" style="s2">bit on psychedelics and get into my</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.180" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">personal journey a bit after that okay I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.120" end="00:12:03.430" style="s2">guess it goes back to my first question</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:05.110" style="s2">to the audience which was how many</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.430" end="00:12:07.300" style="s2">people know someone with mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.110" end="00:12:10.510" style="s2">and I was expecting it to be everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.300" end="00:12:12.910" style="s2">because 45 percent of Australians</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.510" end="00:12:15.010" style="s2">currently well will experience mental</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.910" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">illness that in their lifetime and one</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.010" end="00:12:19.390" style="s2">in five currently suffering from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:22.450" style="s2">mental illness feels pretty staggering I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.390" end="00:12:23.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s 30 percent of men and 40</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.450" end="00:12:25.740" style="s2">percent of women will experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.950" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">depression at some point in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.740" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">so it&#39;s not the person sitting next to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">you it&#39;s you sir it&#39;s quiet affecting</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:41.170" style="s2">yes and there&#39;s many different ways to I</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:42.760" style="s2">mean how do you even one of the toughest</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.170" end="00:12:46.630" style="s2">things and I can speak to depression a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.760" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">little bit there&#39;s a feeling of a lack</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.630" end="00:12:53.350" style="s2">of a lack of options like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:57.970" style="s2">diminishment of your own agency and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.350" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">there&#39;s also at least in my case a lack</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.970" end="00:13:04.200" style="s2">of connection to something worth moving</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:07.510" style="s2">towards and now in an interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.200" end="00:13:09.660" style="s2">something worth moving towards often</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.510" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">takes its roots in something within</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.660" end="00:13:17.380" style="s2">there&#39;s an ember of life that you carry</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:19.180" style="s2">and are in relationship to that I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.380" end="00:13:20.140" style="s2">projects itself out into the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.180" end="00:13:21.660" style="s2">so you kind of whose connect</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.140" end="00:13:24.040" style="s2">into that and then you lose connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.660" end="00:13:25.630" style="s2">to what that needs to be and how you</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.630" end="00:13:31.330" style="s2">then on top of that you lose a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.180" end="00:13:35.230" style="s2">sense of options and you also lose an</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.230" end="00:13:37.890" style="s2">you&#39;re going about it from a very</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.370" end="00:13:49.780" style="s2">chemical bath of the brain or well we</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.950" end="00:13:53.020" style="s2">have this hypothesis of increasing</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:10.090" style="s2">right there is a person and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.580" end="00:14:13.480" style="s2">story Christ so we find with traditional</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.090" end="00:14:16.690" style="s2">therapies is that they do work in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.480" end="00:14:19.540" style="s2">people it&#39;s not too much for the placebo</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.690" end="00:14:21.610" style="s2">they do work in some people but when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.540" end="00:14:23.980" style="s2">withdraw them generally that person</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.610" end="00:14:26.740" style="s2">relapses and also there&#39;s a whole host</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.980" end="00:14:28.150" style="s2">of side effects with regular medications</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.740" end="00:14:30.340" style="s2">and you have to take them every single</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.150" end="00:14:33.430" style="s2">day I think one of the most striking</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.340" end="00:14:36.940" style="s2">things about psychedelic therapy is in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.430" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">the trials after just one or two doses</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.940" end="00:14:43.900" style="s2">of psilocybin people experience a relief</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:46.300" style="s2">of their depression that lasts up to all</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.900" end="00:14:50.260" style="s2">so far we&#39;ve had follow-ups for three</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.300" end="00:14:54.640" style="s2">months six months and a year yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.260" end="00:14:56.820" style="s2">seen quite a remarkable amount of study</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.640" end="00:15:00.570" style="s2">in the last 10 to 15 years into</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.820" end="00:15:03.490" style="s2">substances like psilocybin MDMA also</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.570" end="00:15:05.230" style="s2">ketamine ibogaine to a lesser extent</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.490" end="00:15:07.930" style="s2">although that&#39;s also something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.230" end="00:15:10.360" style="s2">proved very efficacious for addiction</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.930" end="00:15:12.550" style="s2">right right so yeah these different</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.360" end="00:15:16.150" style="s2">substances seem to have different niches</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.550" end="00:15:18.640" style="s2">of effect for across really a range of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.150" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">conditions from addiction to depression</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.640" end="00:15:23.860" style="s2">to PTSD also some stuff on OCD as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:28.390" style="s2">which is quite peculiar because OCD is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.860" end="00:15:31.390" style="s2">really strange as is it it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.390" end="00:15:33.320" style="s2">cognitive rigidity right yes yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.390" end="00:15:36.060" style="s2">think everything&#39;s strange so</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.320" end="00:15:38.459" style="s2">everything is both curious a normal</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.060" end="00:15:40.860" style="s2">stranger and strange it&#39;s the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.459" end="00:15:42.810" style="s2">the world I think a pattern in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.860" end="00:15:44.700" style="s2">depression anxiety in</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.810" end="00:15:48.990" style="s2">obsessive-compulsive disorder is a</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.990" end="00:15:53.910" style="s2">the mind a patterned way of behaving yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.470" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">and this goes back to Tim&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.910" end="00:16:01.980" style="s2">comment about the person and trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:03.720" style="s2">and well if you were if you were born to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.980" end="00:16:07.410" style="s2">a family where there was domestic abuse</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.720" end="00:16:09.899" style="s2">if you experienced a trauma growing up</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.410" end="00:16:13.320" style="s2">if you were a soldier on the frontlines</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.899" end="00:16:16.350" style="s2">of war the thing with the brain is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.320" end="00:16:19.980" style="s2">a wonderful learning machine but the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.350" end="00:16:23.010" style="s2">imprints of our experience live on for</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.980" end="00:16:25.260" style="s2">our neuronal connections so storylines</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.010" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">propagate that&#39;s why we see survivors of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.260" end="00:16:29.820" style="s2">childhood trauma fulfilling the same old</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:32.490" style="s2">story lines whether it be domestic abuse</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.820" end="00:16:35.089" style="s2">entering domestic entering violent or</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.490" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">abusive relationships repetitively</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.089" end="00:16:41.190" style="s2">because that&#39;s what their brain was set</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:43.649" style="s2">up to attach to to relate to to feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.190" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">familiar with so it comes down to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.649" end="00:16:50.490" style="s2">changing our storylines had early change</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:53.310" style="s2">and adapt I more consciously choose who</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.490" end="00:16:55.829" style="s2">we want to be right I feel that that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.310" end="00:16:58.500" style="s2">the opportunity and the great</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.829" end="00:17:01.230" style="s2">therapeutic power behind psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.500" end="00:17:05.390" style="s2">they&#39;re shown to increase cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.230" end="00:17:10.199" style="s2">flexibility and we see in brain studies</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.390" end="00:17:11.370" style="s2">brain imaging using fMRI we see an area</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.199" end="00:17:14.520" style="s2">the brain called the default mode</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.370" end="00:17:18.689" style="s2">Network issues along the midline which</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.520" end="00:17:21.449" style="s2">is correlated to our rumination our</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.689" end="00:17:23.550" style="s2">sense of self our storyline we find it</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.449" end="00:17:25.260" style="s2">active when people are daydreaming or</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.260" end="00:17:30.809" style="s2">chop them past we find disintegration</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.040" end="00:17:33.170" style="s2">within this neuro with this network</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.809" end="00:17:36.390" style="s2">right so when the psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.170" end="00:17:38.670" style="s2">kicks in acutely yes what were the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.390" end="00:17:40.830" style="s2">digression so I know these studies</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.670" end="00:17:43.020" style="s2">largely come out of Imperial College</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.830" end="00:17:45.179" style="s2">London is that right for the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.020" end="00:17:46.890" style="s2">show the increased intra entropic state</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.179" end="00:17:47.820" style="s2">of the brain that&#39;s right right</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.890" end="00:17:50.460" style="s2">and what was they were they using</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.820" end="00:17:52.290" style="s2">psilocybin or LSA well they&#39;ve used LSD</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.460" end="00:17:56.310" style="s2">and psilocybin was your memorized</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.290" end="00:17:59.010" style="s2">studies okay okay so to synthesize that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.310" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">is it if I&#39;m i right in saying something</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.010" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">like psilocybin and LSD certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:09.540" style="s2">thresholds create a state of entropy in</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">the brain at the diminishment of is that</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.290" end="00:18:23.310" style="s2">of view is it&#39;s kind of like a removal</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.620" end="00:18:25.800" style="s2">of the the rigidity that you yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.310" end="00:18:29.610" style="s2">move through the world and experience</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.950" end="00:18:40.350" style="s2">your self storyline right right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.440" end="00:18:42.950" style="s2">something that jumps out to me still</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.350" end="00:18:49.290" style="s2">saying in the therapeutic realm there is</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.710" end="00:19:03.450" style="s2">something about approaching those in a</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.710" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">alternative way well what way should we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.200" end="00:21:15.389" style="s2">choose this is a very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:18.059" style="s2">question and it&#39;s one of those questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.389" end="00:21:20.009" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.059" end="00:21:22.049" style="s2">generic answer can only get you so far</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.009" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">and then you start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.049" end="00:21:27.960" style="s2">philosophy quite quickly because we all</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:30.840" style="s2">have individual lives and while there</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.960" end="00:21:34.980" style="s2">are in an important way like deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.840" end="00:21:38.009" style="s2">patterns that we all have within us are</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.980" end="00:21:39.990" style="s2">in relation to and we share those how</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.009" end="00:21:42.740" style="s2">they actually manifest out in all our</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.990" end="00:21:46.710" style="s2">individual lives are quite different so</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.740" end="00:21:50.549" style="s2">here then we get to a point where maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.710" end="00:21:53.720" style="s2">we can talk about why I&#39;m interested to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.549" end="00:21:56.879" style="s2">know how you would tell me now how have</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.720" end="00:21:59.850" style="s2">psychedelics been of benefit to you I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.879" end="00:22:01.769" style="s2">guess that first of all they were the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.850" end="00:22:04.249" style="s2">concept the psychedelic was inspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.769" end="00:22:07.830" style="s2">me and I guess I came across them in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.249" end="00:22:11.110" style="s2">not not the most typical way it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.830" end="00:22:15.070" style="s2">actually in my first</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.139" end="00:22:40.059" style="s2">lecturer would put music and</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:50.769" style="s2">of university was it was a really nice</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.289" end="00:22:56.679" style="s2">treat for getting out of bed so early</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.769" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">and yeah but that was his character and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.679" end="00:23:01.029" style="s2">then he would proceed with the lecture</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:03.129" style="s2">and one of the recommended readings was</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.029" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">out as Huxley&#39;s the doors of perception</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.129" end="00:23:10.179" style="s2">as anyone read yep who&#39;s read the doors</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:13.389" style="s2">a couple reluctant hands yeah there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.929" end="00:23:22.950" style="s2">psychedelic compounds started from</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:27.730" style="s2">peyote and he described in this book</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.730" end="00:23:33.669" style="s2">chemical he also said that psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:36.220" style="s2">and the experience was of the plane of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.669" end="00:23:38.919" style="s2">art and a perpetual creation and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.220" end="00:23:42.759" style="s2">one day they may serve to heal mental</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.919" end="00:23:45.100" style="s2">illness and at the time I was caught</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.759" end="00:23:48.340" style="s2">between the crossroads of wanting to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.100" end="00:23:50.909" style="s2">a visual artist but quite attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.340" end="00:23:55.809" style="s2">philosophy and science and here was this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.909" end="00:23:57.879" style="s2">field this chemical this medicine we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.809" end="00:24:01.119" style="s2">say that now the back then it was less</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.879" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">clear this medicine they had the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.119" end="00:24:09.460" style="s2">potential to connect one both to art</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:12.820" style="s2">meaning and also heal and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.460" end="00:24:16.119" style="s2">spellbound by this interesting word I</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.820" end="00:24:18.990" style="s2">hadn&#39;t heard before I was Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.119" end="00:24:21.460" style="s2">actually was involved in the naming of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.990" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">psychedelics we the psychiatrist</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.580" end="00:24:36.730" style="s2">a little short poem something along the</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.669" end="00:24:49.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s the name was chosen and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.679" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">strange new word did inspire me I</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.119" end="00:24:54.730" style="s2">transferred from arts to science</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:56.980" style="s2">decidedly to study neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.730" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">somehow become a psychedelic research</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.980" end="00:25:03.700" style="s2">even though there was no such field in</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:05.409" style="s2">Australia and there were few studies</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.700" end="00:25:06.789" style="s2">well there actually were quite another</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.409" end="00:25:09.399" style="s2">but there were a few universities that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.789" end="00:25:10.929" style="s2">had cyclic research programs so I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.399" end="00:25:13.690" style="s2">frequently told this was quite the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.929" end="00:25:15.369" style="s2">aspirational if not absurd dream where</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.690" end="00:25:18.909" style="s2">it was brave enough to share it with</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.369" end="00:25:20.919" style="s2">somebody but I went on and I loved</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.909" end="00:25:24.850" style="s2">nearest science I loved learning about</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.919" end="00:25:28.059" style="s2">the undercurrents the biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.850" end="00:25:29.559" style="s2">undercurrents of consciousness of close</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.059" end="00:25:32.049" style="s2">as we can get anyway because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.559" end="00:25:33.820" style="s2">such a gap there obviously with the hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.049" end="00:25:35.769" style="s2">problem and easy problem consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.820" end="00:25:39.869" style="s2">is to science and your correlates versus</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.769" end="00:25:43.779" style="s2">the experience but I love this field and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.869" end="00:25:45.399" style="s2">I had an aspiration of being a doctor so</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.779" end="00:25:48.629" style="s2">I was doing all the all the correct</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.629" end="00:25:55.899" style="s2">unfortunately in my last semester of uni</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.119" end="00:25:59.259" style="s2">I had a traumatic experience occur which</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.899" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">was quite a shock to my system and I</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.409" end="00:26:23.769" style="s2">and I had not really known anyone even</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.340" end="00:26:25.899" style="s2">though I was tempted I was aware of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.359" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">inspired I had to take in psychedelics</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.370" end="00:26:43.190" style="s2">and I was able to receive some guidance</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:46.850" style="s2">from overseas because there are places</p>

<p begin="00:28:59.320" end="00:29:06.580" style="s2">with care and with maturity this brings</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.620" end="00:29:09.070" style="s2">us I think neatly to the concepts of set</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.580" end="00:29:10.510" style="s2">and setting now I know that as we saw</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.070" end="00:29:12.100" style="s2">from the hands before a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.510" end="00:29:14.440" style="s2">here are familiar with psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.100" end="00:29:16.390" style="s2">so you know I don&#39;t want to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.440" end="00:29:19.090" style="s2">banal in talking about some things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.390" end="00:29:21.460" style="s2">maybe many of you already feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.090" end="00:29:24.010" style="s2">know quite well but the thing is certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.460" end="00:29:25.540" style="s2">setting are really quite deep concepts</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.010" end="00:29:28.150" style="s2">actually when you consider what they</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">mean because life is very strange and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.150" end="00:29:33.220" style="s2">the context we live in is also well very</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:37.090" style="s2">strange and constantly of our own making</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.220" end="00:29:41.470" style="s2">we&#39;re involved in how we show up and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.090" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">also come from a long lineage of culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.470" end="00:29:48.700" style="s2">and evolutionary processes which show us</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:52.180" style="s2">various settings that are helpful or not</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.700" end="00:29:55.570" style="s2">so with that vague kind of introduction</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.180" end="00:29:58.060" style="s2">there Melissa can you tell me what set</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.570" end="00:30:00.250" style="s2">and setting are from at least how</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.060" end="00:30:03.640" style="s2">they&#39;re understood from us from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.250" end="00:30:06.400" style="s2">scientific perspective definitely and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.640" end="00:30:08.530" style="s2">want to restate there was really</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.400" end="00:30:10.600" style="s2">interesting Journal article that came</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.530" end="00:30:12.790" style="s2">out I think last year from again from</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.600" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">the imperial college team and the title</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.790" end="00:30:17.260" style="s2">was psychedelics the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.650" end="00:30:21.820" style="s2">context because certain setting really</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.260" end="00:30:23.380" style="s2">is key set being the mental mindset you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.820" end="00:30:27.100" style="s2">come to with the experience your</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.380" end="00:30:28.870" style="s2">expectations the preparation work the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.100" end="00:30:32.290" style="s2">story what you want out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.870" end="00:30:35.410" style="s2">experience and setting being the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.290" end="00:30:38.050" style="s2">environment was one thing that is true</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.410" end="00:30:40.810" style="s2">about psychedelics as they increase your</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.050" end="00:30:43.030" style="s2">receptivity to the environment your</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.810" end="00:30:45.220" style="s2">receptivity yeah which is which is one</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.030" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">of the ways they facilitate change and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.220" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">this is your internal environment your</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:52.780" style="s2">set and your external environment the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">setting your flexibility and your and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.780" end="00:30:59.530" style="s2">newfound way to relook and receive</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:00.890" style="s2">reinterpret these things is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.530" end="00:31:05.029" style="s2">hallmarks</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.890" end="00:31:09.559" style="s2">but because of that in a dangerous or in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.029" end="00:31:12.919" style="s2">a unsafe or anxiety-inducing or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.559" end="00:31:15.320" style="s2">even an aesthetic environment these</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.919" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">features are enhance and your experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.320" end="00:31:22.580" style="s2">of them is enhanced which is why both</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:24.200" style="s2">preparation work integration work hosts</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.580" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">the experience and the environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.200" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">itself is really important as in trials</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">I collect therapy occurs in a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:34.309" style="s2">different environment to standard</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:38.120" style="s2">doctor&#39;s office or hospital room it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.309" end="00:31:41.750" style="s2">a room that is often full of art comfy</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.120" end="00:31:43.940" style="s2">seats and male and female therapists</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.750" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">pair you close your eyes you have your</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.940" end="00:31:49.130" style="s2">favorite music on so it&#39;s really key to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:52.279" style="s2">create an environment that facilitates</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.130" end="00:31:55.510" style="s2">the changes you want to see in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.279" end="00:31:58.669" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.510" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">crucially an environment that enables</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.669" end="00:32:06.769" style="s2">you to attend to your inner life without</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:11.380" style="s2">fear that the external world or your</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.769" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">sort of baseline physiological concerns</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.380" end="00:32:16.850" style="s2">sort of not taken care of is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:19.130" style="s2">problematic environment to say that in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.850" end="00:32:20.659" style="s2">way that&#39;s not so convoluted you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.130" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">to have your sorted out about you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.659" end="00:32:28.130" style="s2">to engage with your experience mmm I</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:30.260" style="s2">think Tim&#39;s experience with trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.130" end="00:32:31.880" style="s2">truffles in Amsterdam it&#39;s a good case</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.260" end="00:32:33.830" style="s2">in point of what we don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.880" end="00:32:35.980" style="s2">have happen in Australia I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.830" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">necessarily think it&#39;s wise to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.980" end="00:32:40.789" style="s2">psilocybin available at do but I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">been to Amsterdam and it looks like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.789" end="00:32:44.149" style="s2">equivalent of a 7-eleven mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">definitely think that they should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.149" end="00:32:48.740" style="s2">available for people who want to create</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:50.750" style="s2">change in their lives which what</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.740" end="00:32:53.720" style="s2">transformative experiences where people</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.750" end="00:32:56.750" style="s2">move and grow in their existence and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.720" end="00:32:59.059" style="s2">their well-being and talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.750" end="00:33:01.730" style="s2">therapy and well-being I think another</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.059" end="00:33:04.850" style="s2">point related to certain setting to set</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.730" end="00:33:08.539" style="s2">is the work or the positive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.850" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">field such as if you familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.539" end="00:33:14.050" style="s2">concepts of flow mm-hmm lowers interest</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:15.670" style="s2">hello is interesting flow is written by</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.050" end="00:33:18.070" style="s2">a psychologist called me hey chick</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.670" end="00:33:20.260" style="s2">semi-high and it&#39;s quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.070" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">when you look at high performers which</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.260" end="00:33:24.580" style="s2">he did he study the lives of high</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:28.300" style="s2">performers creatives and kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.580" end="00:33:31.300" style="s2">backwards and noted what the condition</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.300" end="00:33:32.830" style="s2">of their lives what traits they have in</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.300" end="00:33:34.120" style="s2">common what were their traits when they</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.830" end="00:33:35.590" style="s2">were working psychological traits</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.120" end="00:33:37.870" style="s2">environmental traits what was that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.590" end="00:33:40.050" style="s2">certain setting that allowed them to</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.870" end="00:33:43.540" style="s2">flourish in the ways that they did and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.050" end="00:33:48.910" style="s2">he observed three key transformative</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.540" end="00:33:52.620" style="s2">skills and they are unconscious self</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.910" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">assurance and this is this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.620" end="00:33:56.890" style="s2">feeling like you are connected to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:33:59.050" style="s2">something feeling like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.890" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">trajectory you can walk and I&#39;ll hope</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.050" end="00:34:04.330" style="s2">that things can get better and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:06.460" style="s2">done in preparation work that&#39;s done in</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.330" end="00:34:08.710" style="s2">your intention setting before a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.460" end="00:34:11.770" style="s2">psychedelic experience so is this like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.710" end="00:34:13.750" style="s2">belief in your own competence do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.770" end="00:34:16.810" style="s2">degree and particularly I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.750" end="00:34:21.310" style="s2">context of therapy to heal or to recover</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.810" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">mm-hmm so that without that vision of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.310" end="00:34:25.630" style="s2">the trajectory that we&#39;re heading</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:28.750" style="s2">towards how are we really going to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.630" end="00:34:30.550" style="s2">there mm-hmm that&#39;s a key one so</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.750" end="00:34:32.580" style="s2">establishment of goals sounds really</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.550" end="00:34:36.070" style="s2">goals like goals that are like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.580" end="00:34:40.510" style="s2">reasonably attainable yes right or even</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.070" end="00:34:44.159" style="s2">and or even just a belief that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.510" end="00:34:46.810" style="s2">change okay and then there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.159" end="00:34:48.820" style="s2">interconnectedness to the world so not</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.810" end="00:34:50.890" style="s2">seeing yourself is separate from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.820" end="00:34:53.730" style="s2">world noticing it you&#39;re part of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.890" end="00:34:56.890" style="s2">ecosystem a social ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.730" end="00:34:58.990" style="s2">environmentally kosis tuned and it can</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.890" end="00:35:01.990" style="s2">even probably go further than that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.990" end="00:35:05.830" style="s2">we are if we start speaking the Carl</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.990" end="00:35:07.360" style="s2">Sagan sense of same heavens that we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.830" end="00:35:09.400" style="s2">made from once came from stars that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.360" end="00:35:11.320" style="s2">things are interconnected mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.400" end="00:35:14.530" style="s2">human beings are not it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.320" end="00:35:16.650" style="s2">coherent concept that you can have of</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.530" end="00:35:19.960" style="s2">all the human being without</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.650" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">simultaneously like recognizing our</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.960" end="00:35:24.070" style="s2">embeddedness in everything I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:26.870" style="s2">there are no plants to attend to our</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.070" end="00:35:28.850" style="s2">atmosphere then we&#39;re in big trouble</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.870" end="00:35:31.070" style="s2">there&#39;s no separate you it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.850" end="00:35:34.190" style="s2">can&#39;t can&#39;t be as a thing you have your</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.070" end="00:35:36.910" style="s2">own influence in your space but as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.190" end="00:35:39.770" style="s2">separate fixed thing entirely</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.910" end="00:35:42.140" style="s2">conceptually divorced it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.770" end="00:35:43.790" style="s2">can&#39;t that can&#39;t be sustained that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.140" end="00:35:46.670" style="s2">is links between you and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.790" end="00:35:47.840" style="s2">and awareness so how you are connected</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.670" end="00:35:51.140" style="s2">who you&#39;re connected to and our</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.840" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">willingness to connect and this Orient</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.140" end="00:35:55.490" style="s2">is called this trait an orientation to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:35:59.060" style="s2">the world and it&#39;s quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.490" end="00:36:01.850" style="s2">because psychedelics have been noted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.060" end="00:36:04.550" style="s2">increase the classic romantic trait</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.850" end="00:36:07.340" style="s2">called nature relatedness which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.550" end="00:36:10.040" style="s2">pretty much an awareness that you are</p>

<p begin="00:36:15.700" end="00:36:20.060" style="s2">psychedelics tend to increase this this</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.690" end="00:36:44.110" style="s2">solutions so three transformative skills</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.140" end="00:36:49.190" style="s2">are in an orientation towards the world</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a really important one yeah the</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.650" end="00:40:27.590" style="s2">interested to know where where do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.140" end="00:40:30.320" style="s2">think we are with respect to how much</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.590" end="00:40:32.750" style="s2">movement can be made to put some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.320" end="00:40:35.480" style="s2">like put more studies together to figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.750" end="00:40:39.260" style="s2">out some of this stuff and also where do</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.480" end="00:40:42.290" style="s2">you aim to try and get that well I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.260" end="00:40:44.210" style="s2">it&#39;s often we talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.290" end="00:40:47.720" style="s2">psychedelic field that there&#39;s this this</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.210" end="00:40:49.180" style="s2">Boulder and when is it going to start</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.720" end="00:40:52.370" style="s2">moving down the hill</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.180" end="00:40:55.040" style="s2">when is the momentum going to kick in I</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.370" end="00:40:55.670" style="s2">do think that momentum is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:57.200" style="s2">kick in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.670" end="00:41:00.680" style="s2">luckily I&#39;m not sure if everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.200" end="00:41:02.570" style="s2">aware that both MDMA and psilocybin have</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.680" end="00:41:04.580" style="s2">been declared breakthrough therapies by</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.570" end="00:41:07.580" style="s2">the American FDA or Food and Drug</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.580" end="00:41:10.040" style="s2">Administration which is a really</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.580" end="00:41:14.600" style="s2">important step because not only will the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.040" end="00:41:17.600" style="s2">FDA be supporting the movement of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.600" end="00:41:20.540" style="s2">drugs from unknown or illicit to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.600" end="00:41:22.760" style="s2">medicines they provide feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.540" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">advice more quickly to the group the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.760" end="00:41:29.270" style="s2">research groups achieving these studies</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:32.260" style="s2">so it&#39;s a really exciting step and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.270" end="00:41:35.540" style="s2">something that I feel the research and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.260" end="00:41:38.060" style="s2">regulatory environment in Australia has</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.540" end="00:41:41.030" style="s2">listened to and really has to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.060" end="00:41:44.180" style="s2">because as these drugs are reclassified</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.030" end="00:41:46.280" style="s2">as medicines overseas of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.180" end="00:41:48.110" style="s2">Australia will want to have the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.280" end="00:41:50.630" style="s2">cutting-edge treatments because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.110" end="00:41:53.300" style="s2">that we are ultimately an innovative</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.630" end="00:41:55.790" style="s2">country and psychedelics are truly</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.300" end="00:41:57.950" style="s2">innovation in mental health treatment</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.790" end="00:42:00.950" style="s2">they are next-generation mental health</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.950" end="00:42:03.800" style="s2">treatment so that I guess a limiting</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.950" end="00:42:05.650" style="s2">factor is still bridging this gap</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.800" end="00:42:07.809" style="s2">between a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.650" end="00:42:09.849" style="s2">Kodama conservatism or a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.809" end="00:42:12.039" style="s2">knowledge which is definitely why my</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.849" end="00:42:14.650" style="s2">medicine Australia was conceived to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.039" end="00:42:16.990" style="s2">educate and to share and to create a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.650" end="00:42:20.619" style="s2">bridge or nexus between the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.990" end="00:42:25.270" style="s2">environment academics clinicians and</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.619" end="00:42:28.059" style="s2">culture the other really important thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.270" end="00:42:32.410" style="s2">is funding because and probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.059" end="00:42:35.319" style="s2">difficult part but also a freeing aspect</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.410" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">perhaps about cyclic research is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.319" end="00:42:42.309" style="s2">Big Pharma is not interested because of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:46.029" style="s2">patents on the substances of Lon Lon the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.309" end="00:42:50.380" style="s2">also there&#39;s the factor of between 1 and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.029" end="00:42:53.770" style="s2">2 when MDMA 1 2 3 2 2 3 treatments and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.380" end="00:42:58.660" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna experience huge increases</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.770" end="00:43:02.970" style="s2">in freedom from whatever condition you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.660" end="00:43:07.510" style="s2">were previously imprisoned within so</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.970" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack therefore of profit drive</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.510" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">behind psychedelics which means that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:15.250" style="s2">MDMA will be a second medicine ever to</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:19.589" style="s2">be brought to market through</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.799" end="00:43:37.089" style="s2">psilocybin will be the third right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.970" end="00:43:39.880" style="s2">so in Australia what are the which are</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.089" end="00:43:41.859" style="s2">the substances you&#39;re targeting has the</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.869" end="00:44:02.910" style="s2">we need to have trials for psilocybin</p>

<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:22.490" style="s2">now psychedelics in lots of ways I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.049" end="00:45:26.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.490" end="00:45:28.910" style="s2">who recognize that the tides are turning</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.540" end="00:45:30.799" style="s2">there are topics in society today that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.910" end="00:45:32.569" style="s2">are also controversial the relationship</p>

<p begin="00:45:44.210" end="00:45:48.740" style="s2">a difficult thing to do and having</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.740" end="00:45:53.619" style="s2">dinner table can be a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.970" end="00:45:58.940" style="s2">thing to do is vital and it&#39;s vital and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.619" end="00:46:02.150" style="s2">a practical thing that helps in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.940" end="00:46:06.470" style="s2">regard is to be able to differentiate a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.150" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">psychedelic from other drugs so how</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.470" end="00:46:10.700" style="s2">would you a lot of things there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:12.920" style="s2">things I want to touch on but bar being</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.700" end="00:46:15.859" style="s2">one of the first thing was you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.920" end="00:46:17.930" style="s2">being honest with yourself I do think</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.859" end="00:46:19.490" style="s2">that one of the great things about</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.930" end="00:46:22.130" style="s2">psychedelics is they kind of force you</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.490" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">to be honest with yourself right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.130" end="00:46:27.380" style="s2">often being said that they sort of put</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.839" end="00:46:29.720" style="s2">up a mirror to who you are right now so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.380" end="00:46:32.329" style="s2">there is that aspect I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.720" end="00:46:33.330" style="s2">important idea of self confrontation I</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.329" end="00:46:34.920" style="s2">think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.330" end="00:46:37.860" style="s2">one of the reasons people can be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.920" end="00:46:39.360" style="s2">trepidatious or anxious I also because</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.860" end="00:46:41.610" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily a clear mirror</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.360" end="00:46:43.980" style="s2">right the message you might get back is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.610" end="00:46:47.100" style="s2">one not you should take with great</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.980" end="00:46:48.870" style="s2">importance but it&#39;s often not going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.100" end="00:46:50.700" style="s2">be a message where it&#39;s like oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.870" end="00:46:52.530" style="s2">got that I can just translate that into</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.700" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">my life immediately it&#39;s all very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.530" end="00:47:00.380" style="s2">clear and the experience of course is</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:47:00.380" style="s2">taking place largely imagistic alee and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:07.800" style="s2">like I suppose growth and development in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.380" end="00:47:09.960" style="s2">life being honest with yourself is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.800" end="00:47:11.730" style="s2">something that takes time and so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.960" end="00:47:14.280" style="s2">feedback you get is something that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.730" end="00:47:18.300" style="s2">have to work with yeah so I&#39;m coming to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.280" end="00:47:19.430" style="s2">a point of responsibility as well going</p>

<p begin="00:50:07.770" end="00:50:12.300" style="s2">thought I might lose them and so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.620" end="00:50:14.520" style="s2">thought okay well maybe at night time</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.300" end="00:50:15.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll write my book on covers with Ashley</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.520" end="00:50:19.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a scratching noise of the pen</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.910" end="00:50:29.250" style="s2">right well person&#39;s breaking the rules</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.920" end="00:50:34.950" style="s2">what does that mean for me so I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.250" end="00:50:36.180" style="s2">writing in the shower a partner I tell</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.950" end="00:50:38.220" style="s2">this story because it made me realize</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.180" end="00:50:41.820" style="s2">the responsibility of the rule breaker</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.220" end="00:50:43.320" style="s2">and that is if you break rules you</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.820" end="00:50:46.220" style="s2">better break them like they didn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.320" end="00:50:46.220" style="s2">to be there in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.490" end="00:50:52.590" style="s2">well and on that note then we&#39;re going</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.590" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">evening we started a little late but</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">we&#39;ll still do a 15 20 minute in to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll come back where I invite</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:04.190" style="s2">anyone who wants to to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:08.390" style="s2">and then also I want to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.190" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">a forum type component which involves if</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.390" end="00:51:12.290" style="s2">any of you guys want to answer a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:14.510" style="s2">question then</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.510" end="00:51:17.540" style="s2">and share something it&#39;s that&#39;s the sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.339" end="00:51:21.740" style="s2">of thing that can go disastrously wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.540" end="00:51:24.230" style="s2">I suppose and so Melissa and I will like</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.740" end="00:51:27.079" style="s2">answer I suppose a fair chunk of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.230" end="00:51:28.700" style="s2">but if someone does feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.079" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">really resonate with a particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.700" end="00:51:33.050" style="s2">question has something to add then I</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:34.040" style="s2">welcome you to come and share that so</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.050" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">anyway thank you so much for your</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.190" end="00:51:55.220" style="s2">done here is set up a microphone there</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.030" end="00:51:56.329" style="s2">and somehow looks off in like us in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.220" end="00:51:58.550" style="s2">strange I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.329" end="00:52:01.819" style="s2">particularly how it should look by it</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.550" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">works and so if you have a question to</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.819" end="00:52:08.630" style="s2">ask about anything at all ask it and if</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:12.710" style="s2">we can&#39;t answer it we can&#39;t answer it</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.630" end="00:52:14.859" style="s2">but if we can we will try so anytime</p>

<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:24.290" style="s2">thank you for the chat this this evening</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.740" end="00:52:25.910" style="s2">my question is so you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.290" end="00:52:28.190" style="s2">before about the phase 2 and phase 3</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.910" end="00:52:30.440" style="s2">studies and how it&#39;s looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.190" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">future but I&#39;d like to know less less</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.440" end="00:52:34.460" style="s2">science more your opinion when do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:36.230" style="s2">think well the day will come that people</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.460" end="00:52:38.680" style="s2">can actually go to a trained</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.230" end="00:52:41.210" style="s2">psychotherapist and have access to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.680" end="00:52:42.440" style="s2">psilocybin or MDMA or ketamine or if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.210" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">want to answer them individually based</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.440" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">on where they&#39;re at and phase 2 or 3</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:47.990" style="s2">trials remember not science more just</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:49.940" style="s2">your opinion your intuition well with</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.990" end="00:52:54.530" style="s2">MDMA it&#39;s likely to be a medicine in</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.940" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">2021 and with the question about therapy</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.530" end="00:52:58.130" style="s2">a trained therapist so that also brings</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:00.200" style="s2">into questions and need to train</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.130" end="00:53:02.450" style="s2">therapists and that&#39;s actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.200" end="00:53:04.670" style="s2">the focuses of my medicine Australia</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.450" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of here to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.670" end="00:53:07.970" style="s2">got the clinical outcomes look at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:09.799" style="s2">clinical research and find ways of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.970" end="00:53:12.829" style="s2">translating that the therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.799" end="00:53:14.390" style="s2">practice so in the next year we hope to</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.829" end="00:53:17.240" style="s2">start creating a therapist training</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.390" end="00:53:20.030" style="s2">program these therapists initially will</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.240" end="00:53:22.339" style="s2">be able to practice in the trials also</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.030" end="00:53:24.760" style="s2">bake at they may just have the extra</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.339" end="00:53:26.750" style="s2">knowledge so they could be integration</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.760" end="00:53:28.940" style="s2">psychologists may not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.750" end="00:53:31.490" style="s2">immediately practice psychedelic therapy</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.940" end="00:53:34.819" style="s2">until regulatory approval has occurred</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.490" end="00:53:39.109" style="s2">in terms of a timeline I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.819" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">sure I feel that if we&#39;re able to get a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.109" end="00:53:44.390" style="s2">frickin concept study friend email so</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">ground in Australia we won&#39;t be that far</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.390" end="00:53:49.010" style="s2">behind the u.s. so they&#39;re expecting</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:51.589" style="s2">Maps is expecting 2021 as the release</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.010" end="00:53:54.349" style="s2">for MDMA so maybe a year or two after</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.589" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">that Australia can follow behind we hope</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.349" end="00:53:58.579" style="s2">to get everything lined up behind the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.760" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">scenes for a pretty quick follow up on</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.579" end="00:54:03.140" style="s2">the American deadline and as for</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:05.990" style="s2">psilocybin I imagine it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.140" end="00:54:08.329" style="s2">few more years after that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.990" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">breakthrough therapy status is a really</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.329" end="00:54:14.180" style="s2">positive sign but we do need to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:16.910" style="s2">phase 3 trials moving forward to star be</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.180" end="00:54:19.730" style="s2">maybe a five-year mark you know that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.910" end="00:54:21.559" style="s2">that&#39;s very ballpark that&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.730" end="00:54:23.180" style="s2">psilocybin and these are also only four</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.559" end="00:54:26.450" style="s2">particular indications which is one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.180" end="00:54:29.540" style="s2">the complications for each indication or</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.450" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">treatment or mental illness or disease</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.540" end="00:54:33.950" style="s2">that we&#39;re treating you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:38.690" style="s2">studied it so we need to have support to</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.950" end="00:54:41.480" style="s2">treat OCD with psilocybin we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.690" end="00:54:43.190" style="s2">phase 3 trials phase 2 trials for OCD</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.480" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">there will be a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.190" end="00:54:48.079" style="s2">treatment protocol after all as well so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:51.079" style="s2">first of all MDMA is gonna be treating</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:52.790" style="s2">PTSD the Phase two trials in through</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.079" end="00:54:56.150" style="s2">psilocybin a treatment resistant</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.790" end="00:54:58.010" style="s2">depression and then I know that max has</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.150" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">plans think is a really exciting one</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.010" end="00:55:03.230" style="s2">also a really sweet one the couples</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:05.569" style="s2">therapy in the future or conjoint</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.230" end="00:55:08.089" style="s2">partner therapy because an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.569" end="00:55:09.650" style="s2">thing about PTSD and trauma is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.089" end="00:55:11.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just affect the individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.650" end="00:55:14.420" style="s2">affects the ecosystem and the people</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:16.520" style="s2">around their individual so currently</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.420" end="00:55:17.670" style="s2">they have been looking at trials where</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.520" end="00:55:21.180" style="s2">not only the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.670" end="00:55:24.359" style="s2">Sothis from Troma is being treated with</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.180" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">MDMA but their partner is too and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.359" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">therefore that partnership can find</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:32.280" style="s2">better ways better solutions of healing</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:34.619" style="s2">and growing in the face of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.280" end="00:55:36.119" style="s2">difficulties that occur and you are in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.619" end="00:55:37.650" style="s2">relationship with somebody who does have</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.119" end="00:55:40.740" style="s2">a history of trauma they get ones a</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.650" end="00:55:43.829" style="s2">really lovely one another indication so</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.740" end="00:55:46.589" style="s2">when you say 20 21 for maps would that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.829" end="00:55:52.020" style="s2">come under the rubric of PTSD PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.589" end="00:55:53.849" style="s2">complex PTSD PTSD anything that has a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.020" end="00:55:54.660" style="s2">history of trauma and so do you have two</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.849" end="00:55:57.119" style="s2">would you have to get a prescription</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.660" end="00:55:59.099" style="s2">from your local doctor onwards to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.119" end="00:56:03.299" style="s2">it would be to their discretion with</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.099" end="00:56:06.150" style="s2">PTSD yeah and then it would be there</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.299" end="00:56:07.500" style="s2">would be cyclic therapist trained and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.150" end="00:56:09.990" style="s2">they currently in America there is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.500" end="00:56:11.549" style="s2">quite a few training programs ones by</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.990" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">the California Institute of integral</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.549" end="00:56:15.960" style="s2">studies CI is and also Maps has their</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:18.359" style="s2">training programs are currently training</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.960" end="00:56:20.130" style="s2">set up therapists in America and also in</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.359" end="00:56:21.450" style="s2">Europe there&#39;s actually a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.130" end="00:56:23.309" style="s2">Australian psychologists who have</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.450" end="00:56:26.609" style="s2">already done the training with maps in</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.309" end="00:56:28.740" style="s2">Europe so they can help us in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.609" end="00:56:31.349" style="s2">creation of our own therapy training</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.740" end="00:56:35.299" style="s2">program mm-hmm yeah that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.349" end="00:56:39.510" style="s2">it does raise this might be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.299" end="00:56:41.940" style="s2">unnecessary concern but it&#39;s frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.510" end="00:56:45.000" style="s2">still and as good as the movement for it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.940" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">is it is still frustrating that one</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.000" end="00:56:51.720" style="s2">would have to be diagnosed with PTSD if</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">say some of their issues were not ets D</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.720" end="00:56:54.950" style="s2">related but still other issues that</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:58.950" style="s2">could be helped whether it&#39;s depression</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.950" end="00:57:01.170" style="s2">some other affliction so obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.950" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">want to get things moving across all</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.170" end="00:57:08.579" style="s2">fronts where there looks like it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:12.020" style="s2">know it&#39;s relevant to do so but PTSD is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.579" end="00:57:17.069" style="s2">obviously a real thing and trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.020" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">obviously a real thing but recognising</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.069" end="00:57:24.140" style="s2">oneself as a victim treating oneself as</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.599" end="00:57:27.450" style="s2">a victim can be something that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.140" end="00:57:29.099" style="s2">problematic when when it&#39;s overdone I</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.450" end="00:57:31.340" style="s2">don&#39;t have a great point to make here</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.099" end="00:57:36.620" style="s2">rather than to just potentially point to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.340" end="00:57:39.650" style="s2">a problem with having people look to</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.620" end="00:57:41.090" style="s2">recognize you want people to take on an</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.650" end="00:57:42.920" style="s2">issue that they maybe didn&#39;t have as</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.090" end="00:57:44.210" style="s2">much to try and help with another issue</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.920" end="00:57:47.720" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of frustrating that you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.210" end="00:57:49.520" style="s2">to still go through different hoops but</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.720" end="00:57:52.580" style="s2">go through there&#39;s a few things there</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:55.400" style="s2">first thing is these labels that we use</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.580" end="00:57:57.860" style="s2">classify mental illness or categories of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.400" end="00:58:04.070" style="s2">behavior that are necessarily always</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.860" end="00:58:08.090" style="s2">accurately given or diagnosed and or the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.070" end="00:58:11.120" style="s2">sense of taking on a role after</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.090" end="00:58:13.820" style="s2">receiving a diagnosis I am a depressed</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.120" end="00:58:16.120" style="s2">person I have depression I am a victim I</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.820" end="00:58:19.610" style="s2">have PTSD Allah that&#39;s a storyline and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.120" end="00:58:21.530" style="s2">there it&#39;s also in terms of experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.610" end="00:58:23.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a cluster of behaviors it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.530" end="00:58:24.680" style="s2">cluster of behaviors I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.150" end="00:58:26.750" style="s2">important to recognize that we only</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.680" end="00:58:28.550" style="s2">develop all these labels these clusters</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.750" end="00:58:30.320" style="s2">of these clusters of behaviors in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.550" end="00:58:35.240" style="s2">last century in fact probably more like</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.320" end="00:58:37.970" style="s2">in the last 60 years or so and so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.240" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">started a definitive bucket that someone</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:42.770" style="s2">should write really I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:45.860" style="s2">super important message call themselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.770" end="00:58:48.800" style="s2">is that identity it&#39;s a useful clusters</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.860" end="00:58:51.220" style="s2">okay so if I have this these clusters of</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.800" end="00:58:54.830" style="s2">a few of these clusters of behavior I</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.220" end="00:58:59.420" style="s2">have symptoms I had behaviors there</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.830" end="00:59:02.360" style="s2">relate to OCD or ADHD and then with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.420" end="00:59:04.850" style="s2">bucket leave now most closely associated</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.360" end="00:59:06.890" style="s2">yourself with there are treatments there</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.850" end="00:59:10.130" style="s2">are particular observations in</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.890" end="00:59:12.530" style="s2">proactivity so you can say is maybe my</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.130" end="00:59:15.320" style="s2">category that&#39;s not a definitive label</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.530" end="00:59:19.480" style="s2">it so it is useful still it&#39;s useful I</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.320" end="00:59:22.370" style="s2">think that this this movement from</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.480" end="00:59:24.380" style="s2">calling oneself with PTSD via the shift</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.370" end="00:59:26.510" style="s2">from victim to survivor is really a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.380" end="00:59:29.540" style="s2">really important one know unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.510" end="00:59:32.390" style="s2">calls themself or wants to have a victim</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.540" end="00:59:35.450" style="s2">based mentality but it is a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.390" end="00:59:38.270" style="s2">of a certain neurochemical changes it</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.450" end="00:59:39.860" style="s2">occur after trauma as I said before this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.270" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">soft repeating self-fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.860" end="00:59:45.890" style="s2">storylines yes that&#39;s no doubt true</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:46.930" style="s2">this will take us off topic a bit but</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.890" end="00:59:51.640" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.930" end="00:59:55.520" style="s2">it is the case that quite a pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.640" end="00:59:58.940" style="s2">lens people use to view the world at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.520" end="01:00:01.640" style="s2">moment is one that divides the world up</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.940" end="01:00:05.420" style="s2">into groups where some of those groups</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.640" end="01:00:09.890" style="s2">are inherently oppressed by other groups</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.420" end="01:00:13.420" style="s2">and so one&#39;s identity becomes similarly</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.890" end="01:00:16.220" style="s2">why do I use that word one&#39;s identity is</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.420" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">taken to be that group identity of an</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.220" end="01:00:22.820" style="s2">oppressed group when there may be real</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:25.100" style="s2">individual trauma that&#39;s occurred in</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.820" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">their lives and that&#39;s all entirely</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.100" end="01:00:30.830" style="s2">relevant but it is an unfortunate case</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:35.060" style="s2">that there are ways of viewing the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.830" end="01:00:40.100" style="s2">that box people up into these categories</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.060" end="01:00:44.120" style="s2">before they engage with their individual</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.100" end="01:00:45.170" style="s2">experience to the extent required for</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.120" end="01:00:48.500" style="s2">the kind of growth and transformation</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.170" end="01:00:50.810" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about yeah I hear that</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.500" end="01:00:53.330" style="s2">and I have a few thoughts on that and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.810" end="01:00:56.120" style="s2">think or one point is if there is such a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.330" end="01:00:58.580" style="s2">thing as multi generational trauma and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.120" end="01:01:00.410" style="s2">my first thought also is with trauma on</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.580" end="01:01:04.310" style="s2">a neurological level it traps that</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.410" end="01:01:05.930" style="s2">person in the past it traps that person</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.310" end="01:01:09.290" style="s2">at the point at which the trauma</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.930" end="01:01:11.990" style="s2">occurred they lose a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.290" end="01:01:15.110" style="s2">themselves in the present moment and in</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.990" end="01:01:18.230" style="s2">the future I think this can occur from</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.110" end="01:01:21.260" style="s2">an incident it can occur from multiple</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.230" end="01:01:24.080" style="s2">incidents say a domestic abuse something</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.260" end="01:01:28.460" style="s2">like that it can also occur occur I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.080" end="01:01:31.670" style="s2">not on a generational level of passed</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.460" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">down emotional habits of parents and</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.670" end="01:01:36.050" style="s2">things like that so the first thing we</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:37.430" style="s2">need to do in it whatever it when it if</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.050" end="01:01:41.720" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to strike up a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.430" end="01:01:44.180" style="s2">which is present and forward orientated</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.720" end="01:01:45.800" style="s2">is try and help people to build that</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.180" end="01:01:48.710" style="s2">relationship with themselves in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.800" end="01:01:53.180" style="s2">present and in the future quite</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.710" end="01:01:56.690" style="s2">interesting neurologically the place</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.180" end="01:01:59.059" style="s2">that we store our self-concept</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.690" end="01:02:00.680" style="s2">as it is now and in the past it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.059" end="01:02:03.140" style="s2">located in one area at the default mode</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.680" end="01:02:06.049" style="s2">Network which we discussed before where</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.140" end="01:02:08.630" style="s2">is the future self before moving Souls</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.049" end="01:02:10.270" style="s2">is actually located somewhere else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.630" end="01:02:13.400" style="s2">located in the dorsolateral prefrontal</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.270" end="01:02:15.829" style="s2">cortex further forward and more lateral</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.400" end="01:02:18.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually the area that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.829" end="01:02:20.359" style="s2">generally associated with other people</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.200" end="01:02:24.349" style="s2">so when we&#39;re thinking about our future</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.359" end="01:02:27.430" style="s2">self on a near logical level it looks</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.349" end="01:02:30.549" style="s2">like we&#39;re thinking about somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.430" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">so that really is a relationship then</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.549" end="01:02:35.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what really is a relationship I</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:40.700" style="s2">was also interesting is that in</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.660" end="01:02:44.150" style="s2">depression and in trauma our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.700" end="01:02:47.720" style="s2">access the alberene area of the brain is</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.150" end="01:02:50.750" style="s2">diminished and in trauma even the car</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.720" end="01:02:52.760" style="s2">itself is diminished so if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.750" end="01:02:54.170" style="s2">know yourself in the present or in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.760" end="01:02:56.210" style="s2">future happen you build a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.170" end="01:02:59.329" style="s2">or a trajectory of where you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.210" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">which is one of the powers of these</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.329" end="01:03:02.900" style="s2">medicines mm-hmm under the influence of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:06.349" style="s2">psychedelics acutely</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.900" end="01:03:09.109" style="s2">we see increased communication between</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.349" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">these two regions in the brain mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.109" end="01:03:15.319" style="s2">and we also see that after a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:18.049" style="s2">experience participants were more</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.319" end="01:03:20.809" style="s2">accurate about their future projections</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.049" end="01:03:23.029" style="s2">in terms of outcomes in their lives and</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.809" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">this was measured in the psilocybin</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.029" end="01:03:29.539" style="s2">study by Imperial this is the same study</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:32.920" style="s2">that showed that with one large one</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.539" end="01:03:35.690" style="s2">small dose of psilocybin for two doses</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.920" end="01:03:37.279" style="s2">patients who had treatment resistant</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.690" end="01:03:40.520" style="s2">depression so this is de precios being</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.279" end="01:03:43.400" style="s2">treated by multiple antidepressants and</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.520" end="01:03:44.059" style="s2">other forms of therapy and all attempts</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.400" end="01:03:47.599" style="s2">have failed</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.059" end="01:03:50.270" style="s2">I had a 67 percent rate of alleviation</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.599" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">of being free from their depression</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.270" end="01:03:53.420" style="s2">either one week follow up at a</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:55.400" style="s2">three-month follow-up it started to</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.420" end="01:03:58.369" style="s2">decrease slightly around that point but</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.400" end="01:04:00.170" style="s2">it was still significant so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.369" end="01:04:03.630" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting developing the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.170" end="01:04:04.829" style="s2">relationship with your future self</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.630" end="01:04:07.170" style="s2">and therefore having more accurate</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.829" end="01:04:09.630" style="s2">prediction about your own behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.170" end="01:04:14.059" style="s2">who you can be I think they&#39;re beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.630" end="01:04:17.369" style="s2">thoughts and so just in closing to tie</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.059" end="01:04:19.710" style="s2">why I mentioned just before what&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.369" end="01:04:23.029" style="s2">think most important is that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.710" end="01:04:27.289" style="s2">recognize every individuals capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.029" end="01:04:30.269" style="s2">take ownership of their own lives as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.289" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">essentially divine of fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.269" end="01:04:35.309" style="s2">capacity now it&#39;s difficult because</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:38.999" style="s2">there are some individuals who are</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.309" end="01:04:42.710" style="s2">particularly embattled by life by their</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.999" end="01:04:46.829" style="s2">experiences such that they cannot find</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.710" end="01:04:49.349" style="s2">they cannot access that space to move</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.829" end="01:04:54.089" style="s2">from agency and those people of course</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.349" end="01:04:58.710" style="s2">require care right they require care but</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.089" end="01:05:02.869" style="s2">it is a frustration of mine that we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.710" end="01:05:06.539" style="s2">be too ready to define ourselves as</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.869" end="01:05:09.329" style="s2">victims or oppressed due to our</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.539" end="01:05:11.759" style="s2">membership in a group whatever minority</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.329" end="01:05:15.630" style="s2">group that is sometimes a group as large</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.759" end="01:05:17.940" style="s2">as women it&#39;s so necessary to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.630" end="01:05:22.369" style="s2">your own experience and to recognize the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.940" end="01:05:24.930" style="s2">agency you have in your life to become</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.369" end="01:05:26.759" style="s2">to make your life work I totally agree</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.930" end="01:05:29.309" style="s2">and in fact I had a conversation during</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.759" end="01:05:31.559" style="s2">the break with a another woman here who</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.309" end="01:05:32.969" style="s2">is really pleased so another woman who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.559" end="01:05:35.729" style="s2">really interested in the science of</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.969" end="01:05:38.359" style="s2">psychedelics and followers researches</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.729" end="01:05:40.890" style="s2">and organizations on Facebook Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.359" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">podcasts whatever it is she remark how</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.890" end="01:05:47.910" style="s2">few female speakers there are in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:51.119" style="s2">academic world of psychedelics so it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.910" end="01:05:54.239" style="s2">recognizing your capacity and I did</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:55.920" style="s2">recognize my capacity to become the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.239" end="01:05:58.739" style="s2">person and contribute in the way that I</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.920" end="01:06:01.019" style="s2">wanted to be I wanted to be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.739" end="01:06:04.589" style="s2">but there&#39;s also important to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.019" end="01:06:08.910" style="s2">the current state of affairs and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.589" end="01:06:11.390" style="s2">there is a there is clearly a agenda</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.910" end="01:06:14.069" style="s2">disbalance in psychedelic science and</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.390" end="01:06:16.229" style="s2">well I think that that&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.069" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">the problem was psychedelic science I</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.229" end="01:06:20.580" style="s2">think is probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:24.210" style="s2">more reflective on a pattern in society</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.580" end="01:06:27.030" style="s2">at large and I do think this self</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.210" end="01:06:30.930" style="s2">awareness in this agency to move</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.030" end="01:06:33.390" style="s2">forwards regardless of the current</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.930" end="01:06:35.730" style="s2">conditions regardless of the patterns</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.390" end="01:06:38.130" style="s2">that you see you can you can be and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.730" end="01:06:41.220" style="s2">contribute in any way that appeals to</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.130" end="01:06:43.710" style="s2">you personally yes I think a message of</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.220" end="01:06:46.740" style="s2">individual empowerment ISM is is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.710" end="01:06:49.140" style="s2">appropriate and the point is only the</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.740" end="01:06:51.570" style="s2">frustration when an individual doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.140" end="01:06:55.620" style="s2">recognize their own power and capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.570" end="01:06:58.470" style="s2">due to a different set of ideas about</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.620" end="01:06:59.280" style="s2">their skin color or agenda or</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.470" end="01:07:02.940" style="s2">what-have-you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.280" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">no it is partially defined by experience</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.940" end="01:07:09.450" style="s2">and partially defined by as a self story</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:12.600" style="s2">and these are stories that that are</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.450" end="01:07:15.240" style="s2">underpinned in society well yes I mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.600" end="01:07:17.430" style="s2">which we currently become aware of by</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.240" end="01:07:19.800" style="s2">noticing the patents like noticing this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.430" end="01:07:23.670" style="s2">disparity of female voices in</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.800" end="01:07:26.160" style="s2">psychedelic sites noticing the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.670" end="01:07:29.730" style="s2">of intergenerational trauma in our</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.160" end="01:07:31.290" style="s2">native people&#39;s communities I think all</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.730" end="01:07:34.920" style="s2">this stuff is important to notice I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.290" end="01:07:37.110" style="s2">going to say that it&#39;s not self-evident</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.920" end="01:07:39.390" style="s2">to me that the absence of women in</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.110" end="01:07:42.300" style="s2">psychedelic science is due to something</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.390" end="01:07:44.850" style="s2">one would call a pressure that may well</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.300" end="01:07:48.210" style="s2">be a factor I don&#39;t know we see</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.850" end="01:07:50.160" style="s2">differences in where men and women pop</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.210" end="01:07:53.400" style="s2">up in the world and the professions they</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.160" end="01:07:54.870" style="s2">choose for many different reasons this</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.400" end="01:07:57.330" style="s2">is a conversation that has been had a</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.870" end="01:07:59.730" style="s2">lot online and there&#39;s some really good</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.330" end="01:08:05.040" style="s2">stuff out there and it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.730" end="01:08:07.580" style="s2">there is a strong biological and</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.040" end="01:08:11.400" style="s2">psychological argument to be made for</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.580" end="01:08:13.350" style="s2">differences in temperamental proclivity</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.400" end="01:08:16.230" style="s2">between men and women that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.350" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">entirely due to social construction if</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.230" end="01:08:20.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the case then you would expect</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:23.190" style="s2">differences in the number of people that</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.940" end="01:08:26.029" style="s2">go towards different professions this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.190" end="01:08:29.400" style="s2">not to say that we should oppress people</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.029" end="01:08:30.720" style="s2">into choosing one or another thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.400" end="01:08:33.030" style="s2">just a recognition</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.720" end="01:08:34.770" style="s2">sometimes we make different choices so</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.030" end="01:08:38.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not self-evident to me that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.770" end="01:08:41.670" style="s2">would expect a 50/50 split across every</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.430" end="01:08:43.110" style="s2">area in society this is really an absurd</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.670" end="01:08:45.230" style="s2">thought when you think about it there</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.110" end="01:08:49.170" style="s2">are some professions that are entirely</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.230" end="01:08:50.580" style="s2">male-dominated that I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.170" end="01:08:52.140" style="s2">why the hell you&#39;d want to go into at</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.580" end="01:08:55.230" style="s2">all the ones where you&#39;re more likely to</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.140" end="01:08:56.970" style="s2">die doing outside hard manual labor like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.230" end="01:08:58.410" style="s2">climbing telephone wires and</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.970" end="01:09:00.180" style="s2">what-have-you and is that partially</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.410" end="01:09:03.900" style="s2">because there is narrow differences in</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.180" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">society that men ought to be brave and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.900" end="01:09:10.860" style="s2">more reckless and more strong and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:13.800" style="s2">their lives in some sense because they</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.860" end="01:09:15.930" style="s2">don&#39;t bear children are worth less on a</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.800" end="01:09:17.250" style="s2">protective level is this one is this the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.930" end="01:09:19.830" style="s2">reason why because there is this</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.250" end="01:09:23.790" style="s2">narrative I think this narrative plays</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.830" end="01:09:26.390" style="s2">some role but I don&#39;t think that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.790" end="01:09:30.510" style="s2">think that all narratives are</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.390" end="01:09:34.680" style="s2">arbitrarily constructed and not grounded</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.510" end="01:09:37.860" style="s2">in some adaptive reality and some</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.680" end="01:09:39.840" style="s2">adaptive evolutionary don&#39;t play some</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.860" end="01:09:45.180" style="s2">adaptive evolutionary function and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.840" end="01:09:47.490" style="s2">our physiology bears our are better</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.180" end="01:09:50.160" style="s2">suited nurse to one kind of thing or</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.490" end="01:09:53.870" style="s2">another so I think both things are going</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.160" end="01:09:57.050" style="s2">on and when there is a narrative that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.870" end="01:09:59.880" style="s2">preventative of an individual from</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.050" end="01:10:02.370" style="s2">taking the agency towards what they want</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.880" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">to be in their lives this is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.370" end="01:10:06.390" style="s2">the only point I&#39;m making is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.320" end="01:10:09.240" style="s2">far from self-evident and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.390" end="01:10:11.970" style="s2">extremely unlikely and even unnecessary</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.240" end="01:10:14.820" style="s2">why we want to see a 50/50 split in</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.970" end="01:10:16.560" style="s2">anything we don&#39;t see if you see a 50/50</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.820" end="01:10:21.600" style="s2">split in things very very rarely like</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.560" end="01:10:25.560" style="s2">not asking for a 50% split right no in</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.600" end="01:10:28.050" style="s2">every I&#39;m not ask you for that but I am</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.560" end="01:10:32.160" style="s2">highly aware of my own experience as a</p>

<p begin="01:10:44.430" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">thanks guys</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.880" end="01:10:51.330" style="s2">my questions are same topic but a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:55.780" style="s2">different because of the efficacy of</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.330" end="01:11:01.080" style="s2">mushrooms and MDMA my question is about</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.780" end="01:11:03.670" style="s2">mescaline because from my understanding</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.080" end="01:11:07.470" style="s2">experientially and from the chemical</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.670" end="01:11:10.420" style="s2">structure it&#39;s a little bit of both so</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.470" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">can you explain like dude have they done</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.420" end="01:11:15.070" style="s2">any studies what it actually does to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:17.650" style="s2">brain and like would that be a more</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.070" end="01:11:20.140" style="s2">useful tool combining them or for like</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.650" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">different treatments if you care to</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.140" end="01:11:25.240" style="s2">elaborate yeah I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:29.590" style="s2">great question a very Stute observation</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.240" end="01:11:32.200" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a deeply felt topic of</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.590" end="01:11:34.780" style="s2">mine for multiple reasons mescaline is</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.200" end="01:11:36.100" style="s2">is a very interesting psychedelic and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.780" end="01:11:37.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have just the affection purely</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.100" end="01:11:38.470" style="s2">because it was the first one I heard of</p>

<p begin="01:11:41.530" end="01:11:49.390" style="s2">you say the pharmacological level it has</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.030" end="01:11:51.100" style="s2">traits that do compared to MDMA in fact</p>

<p begin="01:15:35.400" end="01:15:40.739" style="s2">was going it&#39;s going much faster for</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.409" end="01:15:43.590" style="s2">psilocybin I think because a lot of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.739" end="01:15:46.020" style="s2">academic conservatism is now worn down</p>

<p begin="01:15:54.239" end="01:15:57.780" style="s2">expensive it is in that ballpark it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.610" end="01:15:59.580" style="s2">very expensive to bring a truck to</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.780" end="01:16:02.040" style="s2">market but it&#39;s a very rational</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.580" end="01:16:05.610" style="s2">observation AMD that mescaline could be</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.040" end="01:16:07.830" style="s2">a really profound target and something I</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.610" end="01:16:10.710" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard tonight you talk about is</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.830" end="01:16:14.340" style="s2">Emma ayahuasca and I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.710" end="01:16:16.860" style="s2">about that and also perhaps and the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.340" end="01:16:19.290" style="s2">practices of shamanism of what the</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.860" end="01:16:22.139" style="s2">indigenous tribes people use in addition</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.290" end="01:16:25.830" style="s2">and to the psychedelic so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.139" end="01:16:27.690" style="s2">smudging the ocurro&#39;s I haven&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.830" end="01:16:29.730" style="s2">I saw they did the clinical start and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.690" end="01:16:31.770" style="s2">trial in Brazil with ayahuasca which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.730" end="01:16:33.449" style="s2">very promising for depression but I just</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.770" end="01:16:35.940" style="s2">thought I&#39;d be interesting to comment on</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.449" end="01:16:37.699" style="s2">ayahuasca and and shamanism in general</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.940" end="01:16:41.849" style="s2">and if you think maps might incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.699" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">some shamanism into their studies yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.849" end="01:16:47.460" style="s2">think that it&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.000" end="01:16:50.639" style="s2">perspective to look at the past and see</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.460" end="01:16:53.429" style="s2">how these medicines have been used and</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.639" end="01:16:57.060" style="s2">in fact had been used for a very long</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.429" end="01:16:59.250" style="s2">time by both different cultures and even</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.060" end="01:17:02.000" style="s2">our own cultures if you somehow relate</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.250" end="01:17:05.219" style="s2">to the European greco-roman tradition</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.000" end="01:17:07.349" style="s2">where the Alison Ian mysteries existed</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.219" end="01:17:08.619" style="s2">and was likely fuelled by something very</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.349" end="01:17:10.599" style="s2">similar to LSD</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.619" end="01:17:13.360" style="s2">that&#39;s within our own tradition Plato</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.599" end="01:17:15.940" style="s2">was quoted as saying that it was one of</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:16.780" style="s2">the most important parts of ancient</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.940" end="01:17:19.599" style="s2">Greek culture</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.780" end="01:17:21.489" style="s2">Cicero a Roman scholar was quoted as</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.599" end="01:17:23.290" style="s2">saying that it was a civilizing aspect</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.489" end="01:17:24.760" style="s2">of 18th Greek culture so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.290" end="01:17:26.920" style="s2">interesting so there was traditions even</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.760" end="01:17:28.989" style="s2">that we can look at from back then well</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.920" end="01:17:31.349" style="s2">you have some records of what they did</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.989" end="01:17:34.540" style="s2">for their seven-day Ellis Tinian mystery</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.349" end="01:17:36.610" style="s2">ceremony ritual I&#39;d only have cultures</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.540" end="01:17:39.790" style="s2">such as the Peruvian culture with</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.610" end="01:17:45.040" style="s2">ayahuasca for centuries have been using</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.790" end="01:17:47.170" style="s2">the brood gaining both DMT and Tomales</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.040" end="01:17:50.260" style="s2">the Chur mio eyes which inhibit the</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.170" end="01:17:51.489" style="s2">breakdown of DMT in the stomach so DMT</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.260" end="01:17:55.150" style="s2">can last much longer</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.489" end="01:17:57.040" style="s2">I definitely think looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.150" end="01:18:00.489" style="s2">setting that they use is really valuable</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.040" end="01:18:04.420" style="s2">we have lessons to learn such as the</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.489" end="01:18:05.889" style="s2">music such as group work</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.420" end="01:18:07.840" style="s2">I think group work is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.889" end="01:18:12.969" style="s2">and something it hasn&#39;t really been</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.840" end="01:18:16.300" style="s2">explored as much in studies yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.969" end="01:18:20.310" style="s2">quite a solo journey so I definitely</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.300" end="01:18:24.570" style="s2">think that there is multiple ways to</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.310" end="01:18:26.860" style="s2">combine therapy with psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.570" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll have to decide and look out for</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.860" end="01:18:35.409" style="s2">each indication for each treatment what</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:37.989" style="s2">is most suitable for example with OCD</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.409" end="01:18:40.330" style="s2">maybe with it what a degree of exposure</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.989" end="01:18:43.150" style="s2">therapy but it would a combination of</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.330" end="01:18:45.280" style="s2">psychotherapy with virtual reality where</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.150" end="01:18:47.650" style="s2">they&#39;re faced with whatever certain</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.280" end="01:18:49.929" style="s2">things that trigger the responses and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.650" end="01:18:51.310" style="s2">then would that be useful so in that and</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.929" end="01:18:52.570" style="s2">you okay so mentioned virtual reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.310" end="01:18:55.210" style="s2">from shamanism and you can so you can</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.570" end="01:18:58.420" style="s2">tell I&#39;m not at all restricted to where</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.210" end="01:19:00.130" style="s2">this comes from I think that ancient</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.420" end="01:19:02.010" style="s2">traditions certainly have value but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.130" end="01:19:05.050" style="s2">also think we can make our own</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.010" end="01:19:08.139" style="s2">traditions and we can combine technology</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.050" end="01:19:11.849" style="s2">you can combine things like biomarkers</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.139" end="01:19:15.520" style="s2">with and feedback live biofeedback</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.849" end="01:19:17.889" style="s2">things like so for OCD when I think of</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.520" end="01:19:19.389" style="s2">instantly is being aware that persons if</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.889" end="01:19:21.140" style="s2">we&#39;re going to combine virtual reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.389" end="01:19:23.480" style="s2">really checking in with that person</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.140" end="01:19:25.840" style="s2">heart rate and breath right to know when</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.480" end="01:19:29.210" style="s2">they&#39;ve reached that point of I discard</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.840" end="01:19:34.100" style="s2">verses I&#39;m still able to process and</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.210" end="01:19:35.840" style="s2">engage so a combination of Athena parson</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.100" end="01:19:39.560" style="s2">looking at the future and looking</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.840" end="01:19:42.800" style="s2">holistically at the body not just the</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.560" end="01:19:44.360" style="s2">mind and ayahuasca yeah is this a really</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.800" end="01:19:46.250" style="s2">powerful substance and there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.360" end="01:19:49.940" style="s2">interesting trials and how it alleviates</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.250" end="01:19:53.120" style="s2">depression also I think that it was with</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.940" end="01:19:55.250" style="s2">ayahuasca that we were shown that after</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.120" end="01:19:57.800" style="s2">ayahuasca a certain mindfulness traits</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.250" end="01:20:01.760" style="s2">were found to be increased like a lack</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.800" end="01:20:04.670" style="s2">of activity acceptance and knowing the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.760" end="01:20:07.060" style="s2">profound effects that we do observe from</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.670" end="01:20:09.710" style="s2">frequent mindfulness meditation practice</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.060" end="01:20:13.220" style="s2">scientifically I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.710" end="01:20:14.800" style="s2">interesting comparison if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.220" end="01:20:18.050" style="s2">predicting that in twenty twenty one</p>

<p begin="01:22:38.529" end="01:22:43.639" style="s2">start using spiritual language very</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.819" end="01:22:45.229" style="s2">quickly to encapsulate the quality of</p>

<p begin="01:23:08.229" end="01:23:15.289" style="s2">good answers for we are in a process of</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.599" end="01:23:17.539" style="s2">I believe building the forums for</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.289" end="01:23:19.359" style="s2">discussion about just what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.539" end="01:23:22.969" style="s2">with this kind of stuff to take place</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.359" end="01:23:26.629" style="s2">the difference between regulatory</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.969" end="01:23:32.529" style="s2">approved therapy using psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.629" end="01:23:35.329" style="s2">the availability of substances to aid</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.529" end="01:23:37.219" style="s2">spiritual development those two things</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.329" end="01:23:40.369" style="s2">in some in some ways are so close</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.219" end="01:23:43.139" style="s2">together but from a legal perspective so</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.369" end="01:23:46.699" style="s2">far apart what is what is</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.139" end="01:23:49.639" style="s2">spiritual and I definitely even still</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.699" end="01:23:52.619" style="s2">coming from a scientific background</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.639" end="01:23:54.929" style="s2">sometimes give a strange taste in my</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.619" end="01:23:56.519" style="s2">mouth when I say the word but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.929" end="01:23:59.459" style="s2">think it&#39;s a dirty word even for a</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.519" end="01:24:03.269" style="s2">scientist because we can we can map that</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.459" end="01:24:05.459" style="s2">territory there are qualities of it and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.269" end="01:24:07.139" style="s2">I think what underwrites it is a sense</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.459" end="01:24:09.510" style="s2">of connection to something greater than</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.139" end="01:24:12.209" style="s2">yourself and that definitely doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.510" end="01:24:16.320" style="s2">have to be any kind of day stick god it</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.209" end="01:24:19.649" style="s2">can just be nature or the universe or</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.320" end="01:24:23.070" style="s2">whatever it is that drives you to want</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.649" end="01:24:25.739" style="s2">to reach out connect grow and be part of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.070" end="01:24:27.389" style="s2">something so I think that this spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.739" end="01:24:30.260" style="s2">is very intimately tied with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.389" end="01:24:34.050" style="s2">therapeutic so there guess also</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.260" end="01:24:37.849" style="s2">referring to recreational I want to</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.050" end="01:24:39.539" style="s2">define the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.849" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">recreational if we go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.539" end="01:24:45.599" style="s2">etymology of the word recreate</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:47.280" style="s2">recreational that says that say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.599" end="01:24:49.289" style="s2">kind of a fueling that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.280" end="01:24:51.449" style="s2">growing it&#39;s a kind of a stopping and</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.289" end="01:24:53.639" style="s2">pausing and seeing where we want to go</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.449" end="01:24:56.489" style="s2">it&#39;s a time for reflection</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.639" end="01:24:58.199" style="s2">I think the recreational unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.489" end="01:24:59.489" style="s2">has a lot of negative connotations and</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.199" end="01:25:01.349" style="s2">the negative connotations I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.489" end="01:25:04.099" style="s2">advocate for anything to do with</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.349" end="01:25:06.719" style="s2">psychedelics being there for escape for</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.099" end="01:25:09.179" style="s2">that this attitude they sometimes see</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.719" end="01:25:13.949" style="s2">and Dinkley other drugs that drug</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.179" end="01:25:16.709" style="s2">culture of getting messed up or getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.949" end="01:25:19.079" style="s2">locked or whatever they whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.709" end="01:25:22.189" style="s2">that people say I definitely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.079" end="01:25:25.439" style="s2">resonate with that I think that</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.189" end="01:25:26.760" style="s2">recreation stopping and pausing and</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.439" end="01:25:31.019" style="s2">looking at where you want to go is</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.760" end="01:25:34.260" style="s2">something different and the spaces</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.019" end="01:25:36.860" style="s2">should be built for people who want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.260" end="01:25:39.599" style="s2">improve themselves in a therapeutic way</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.860" end="01:25:42.510" style="s2">even if they don&#39;t have a very defined</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.599" end="01:25:44.789" style="s2">label just because they want to become a</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.510" end="01:25:46.889" style="s2">better person I think that I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.789" end="01:25:50.010" style="s2">that&#39;s all reasonable and beautifully</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.889" end="01:25:53.579" style="s2">put from the perspective of legality I</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.010" end="01:25:56.159" style="s2">think they&#39;re different issues and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.579" end="01:25:57.030" style="s2">would imagine that I push towards that</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.159" end="01:26:00.570" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.030" end="01:26:02.430" style="s2">idea being allowed I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.570" end="01:26:03.030" style="s2">kind of approach that&#39;s going to take in</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.430" end="01:26:05.130" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.030" end="01:26:07.260" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s there&#39;s gonna be a different</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.130" end="01:26:10.950" style="s2">flavor it will have to be a different</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.260" end="01:26:14.040" style="s2">point of collective awareness and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.950" end="01:26:17.430" style="s2">think that has to take place at an</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.040" end="01:26:20.520" style="s2">individual level and it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.430" end="01:26:23.280" style="s2">point in the turning of the tide where</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.520" end="01:26:26.310" style="s2">it won&#39;t be weather</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.280" end="01:26:28.140" style="s2">well research into therapy will have</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.310" end="01:26:31.320" style="s2">played a massive role to begin with but</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.140" end="01:26:34.410" style="s2">we&#39;ll have to see some other kind of set</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.320" end="01:26:37.890" style="s2">of ideas a different kind of front of</p>

<p begin="01:26:37.890" end="01:26:42.150" style="s2">to this place well I what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.620" end="01:26:43.740" style="s2">say what I am saying is well I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.150" end="01:26:46.140" style="s2">defining what I think is a therapeutic</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.740" end="01:26:48.510" style="s2">context that&#39;s all I&#39;m advocating for a</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.140" end="01:26:52.320" style="s2">therapeutic context right now I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.510" end="01:26:54.420" style="s2">that as people see the results of phase</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.320" end="01:26:57.120" style="s2">you know where the point now where not</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.420" end="01:27:00.330" style="s2">everything is confirmed but why we do</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.120" end="01:27:01.650" style="s2">have phase 3 trials completed I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.330" end="01:27:04.860" style="s2">that they&#39;ll be able interesting point</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.650" end="01:27:06.390" style="s2">to stop and reflect about what is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.860" end="01:27:11.160" style="s2">ideal therapeutic context of</p>

<p begin="01:27:15.780" end="01:27:20.430" style="s2">this sort of medicinal work with a</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.760" end="01:27:24.000" style="s2">shaman there have been some research</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.430" end="01:27:28.050" style="s2">that had said that this can indeed bring</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.000" end="01:27:29.880" style="s2">up trauma and can help integrate pop</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.050" end="01:27:32.400" style="s2">that trauma bubble so to speak so you</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.880" end="01:27:35.400" style="s2">can integrate the lessons and make you a</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.400" end="01:27:38.190" style="s2">new you but there&#39;s also arguments that</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.400" end="01:27:39.780" style="s2">say that people who have dabbled in</p>

<p begin="01:27:39.780" end="01:27:45.090" style="s2">seen a part of themselves ie the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.570" end="01:27:48.600" style="s2">side that has traumatized them even more</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.090" end="01:27:49.800" style="s2">and has not allowed them to go down the</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.600" end="01:27:51.480" style="s2">path of self development and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.800" end="01:27:54.660" style="s2">blocked them as a matter of fact sir</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.480" end="01:27:56.310" style="s2">what I my question really is because</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.660" end="01:27:59.570" style="s2">having been in these circles a few times</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.310" end="01:28:01.920" style="s2">and witnessing many Apple lettera of</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.570" end="01:28:03.930" style="s2">healing and also detrimental work that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.920" end="01:28:07.440" style="s2">has been done from just being too</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.930" end="01:28:09.600" style="s2">infused with the energies around you can</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.440" end="01:28:13.470" style="s2">you walk us through the correct process</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.600" end="01:28:16.140" style="s2">of how to process drama in the state of</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.470" end="01:28:18.180" style="s2">such a heightened psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.140" end="01:28:20.250" style="s2">so you can bring that down and integrate</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.180" end="01:28:23.940" style="s2">it into your reality and making the new</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.250" end="01:28:26.370" style="s2">you because being at that state is so</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.940" end="01:28:27.660" style="s2">tender it can actually be such a</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.370" end="01:28:29.430" style="s2">detriment that you can walk away from</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.660" end="01:28:32.070" style="s2">this going I&#39;m never going to touch any</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.430" end="01:28:33.720" style="s2">kind of psychedelic ever again or you</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.070" end="01:28:35.250" style="s2">would want to delve even deeper into</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.720" end="01:28:36.540" style="s2">your psyche and your shadow and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.250" end="01:28:38.790" style="s2">wanted to devote they even more</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.540" end="01:28:41.700" style="s2">whichever way it goes but I&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.790" end="01:28:45.030" style="s2">to the experts now what is the correct</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.700" end="01:28:47.550" style="s2">and most safest approach to being in</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.030" end="01:28:50.100" style="s2">that state of mind discovering that</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.550" end="01:28:51.960" style="s2">trauma and then integrating that back</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.100" end="01:28:53.670" style="s2">into your reality and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.960" end="01:28:56.880" style="s2">possible way but you and I get to that</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.670" end="01:28:59.640" style="s2">question I also want to touch on like</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.880" end="01:29:02.550" style="s2">this is this is why we&#39;re doing one</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.640" end="01:29:05.670" style="s2">indication at a time why it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.550" end="01:29:08.100" style="s2">to find the therapeutic context the dose</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.670" end="01:29:10.950" style="s2">for each treatment because we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.100" end="01:29:15.420" style="s2">researched classical psychedelics like</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.950" end="01:29:18.320" style="s2">psilocybin or ayahuasca with PTSD yet</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.420" end="01:29:21.120" style="s2">because of this risk of retraumatization</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.320" end="01:29:25.290" style="s2">which is one of the reasons that PTSD s</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.120" end="01:29:28.230" style="s2">notoriously difficult to treat so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.290" end="01:29:30.810" style="s2">why it&#39;s important to follow we have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.230" end="01:29:33.050" style="s2">wait for each indication to be put</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.810" end="01:29:36.330" style="s2">through the rigor of a clinical trial</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.050" end="01:29:39.570" style="s2">before we sort of jumped the gun we want</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.330" end="01:29:42.720" style="s2">to create the systems that best treat</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.570" end="01:29:45.000" style="s2">and best plan for each kind of</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.720" end="01:29:47.580" style="s2">experience of the person may have which</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.000" end="01:29:51.000" style="s2">is why I want to I do want to clarify as</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.580" end="01:29:53.310" style="s2">well that this idea of the betterment of</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.000" end="01:29:57.660" style="s2">well people has to happen very slowly</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.310" end="01:30:00.840" style="s2">and with trials and with practice</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.660" end="01:30:03.600" style="s2">protocols being developed and when it</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.840" end="01:30:06.020" style="s2">comes to PTSD it is really hard because</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.600" end="01:30:09.030" style="s2">of this really narrow window of</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.020" end="01:30:11.070" style="s2">therapeutic tolerance that&#39;s why things</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.030" end="01:30:12.960" style="s2">like exposure therapy are really</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.070" end="01:30:15.440" style="s2">difficult and particularly with certain</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.960" end="01:30:18.570" style="s2">types of trauma like sexual assault</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.440" end="01:30:22.380" style="s2">there is exposure therapy of the 30%</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.570" end="01:30:22.920" style="s2">dropout rate and only 50 I think 49% of</p>

<p begin="01:30:26.250" end="01:30:31.290" style="s2">very good</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.470" end="01:30:36.260" style="s2">whereas MDMA there is generally in the</p>

<p begin="01:30:42.480" end="01:30:48.030" style="s2">I think it does a lot at play he has</p>

<p begin="01:30:48.030" end="01:30:53.510" style="s2">arousal going on so I think the first</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.580" end="01:30:58.860" style="s2">our first step is to become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.510" end="01:31:01.080" style="s2">your biology find practice slowly ways</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.860" end="01:31:04.590" style="s2">of noticing when your heart rate is</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.080" end="01:31:07.200" style="s2">going up this is this is just for</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.590" end="01:31:09.630" style="s2">general PTSD advices is gonna be applied</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.200" end="01:31:11.780" style="s2">to any situation whether it be seeing a</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.630" end="01:31:15.060" style="s2">trigger on the street a loud noise</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.780" end="01:31:17.640" style="s2">becoming aware of the body through</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.060" end="01:31:20.280" style="s2">slowly training in an awareness based</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.640" end="01:31:22.620" style="s2">practice with particularly PTSD with a</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.280" end="01:31:24.450" style="s2">good teacher we&#39;re the psychologist this</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.620" end="01:31:27.000" style="s2">is not something it should be done by</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.450" end="01:31:29.550" style="s2">yourself because even meditation can</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.000" end="01:31:32.190" style="s2">retrigger people with PTSD it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.550" end="01:31:34.380" style="s2">delicate condition so having someone who</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.190" end="01:31:36.060" style="s2">can help you become aware of your own</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.380" end="01:31:37.560" style="s2">body and when you&#39;re starting to go into</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.060" end="01:31:39.570" style="s2">a trauma state so I see things people</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.560" end="01:31:42.390" style="s2">cramping up there changing your position</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.570" end="01:31:45.060" style="s2">movie becoming small protecting yourself</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.390" end="01:31:47.070" style="s2">slowly noticing these physical symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.060" end="01:31:50.760" style="s2">and being able to shift out of them</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.070" end="01:31:53.100" style="s2">first awareness then every opening also</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.760" end="01:31:55.470" style="s2">the way we talk to ourselves is really</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.100" end="01:31:57.780" style="s2">is really important noticing what kind</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.470" end="01:31:59.610" style="s2">of voices are occurring as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.780" end="01:32:03.870" style="s2">noticing yourself entering a trauma</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.610" end="01:32:05.600" style="s2">state is there someone in your head part</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.870" end="01:32:09.120" style="s2">of you putting you down</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.600" end="01:32:12.780" style="s2">can you talk to them that seems a bit</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.120" end="01:32:15.180" style="s2">strange I know but one of the increasing</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.780" end="01:32:17.070" style="s2">popularity is as their there&#39;s a poetic</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.180" end="01:32:19.080" style="s2">protocol called internal family systems</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.070" end="01:32:21.540" style="s2">which is particularly relevant for</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.080" end="01:32:24.960" style="s2">trauma because we see in trauma there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.540" end="01:32:27.390" style="s2">a fractioning of the psyche often that</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.960" end="01:32:29.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of the person that was</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.390" end="01:32:31.650" style="s2">present at the moment of trauma that</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.550" end="01:32:33.810" style="s2">becomes really stuck there</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.650" end="01:32:35.639" style="s2">then there&#39;s the protector who tried to</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.810" end="01:32:37.499" style="s2">come in and be the savior and said</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.639" end="01:32:40.139" style="s2">lock off all your emotions we&#39;ll be fine</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.499" end="01:32:42.419" style="s2">dissociate I&#39;ll be here holding the fort</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.139" end="01:32:44.099" style="s2">and then so there&#39;s that that part that</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.419" end="01:32:45.179" style="s2">was wounded there&#39;s a protector and</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.099" end="01:32:47.459" style="s2">there&#39;s a part that just wants to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.179" end="01:32:49.550" style="s2">distracted there are actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.459" end="01:32:52.949" style="s2">patterns in the way the psyche becomes</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.550" end="01:32:55.590" style="s2">fractured and sometimes these programs</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.949" end="01:32:57.899" style="s2">these parts can become really really</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.590" end="01:33:01.050" style="s2">entrenched and can end up putting that</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.899" end="01:33:04.469" style="s2">person down or taking them back to the</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.050" end="01:33:06.780" style="s2">moment of trauma very at times where</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.469" end="01:33:09.110" style="s2">they are triggered but it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.780" end="01:33:11.459" style="s2">obvious where the trigger is coming from</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.110" end="01:33:13.709" style="s2">going back to that idea of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.459" end="01:33:15.780" style="s2">and creating a relationship with these</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.709" end="01:33:18.570" style="s2">different aspects of yourself talking it</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.780" end="01:33:21.809" style="s2">through with yourself slowly in your own</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.570" end="01:33:24.439" style="s2">mind or even out loud in a point of PTSD</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.809" end="01:33:28.499" style="s2">crisis I think is really valuable and</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.439" end="01:33:30.449" style="s2">having a meditation background slowly</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.499" end="01:33:33.059" style="s2">trained really carefully with somebody I</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.449" end="01:33:36.419" style="s2">think is a really really important and</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.059" end="01:33:40.769" style="s2">valuable tool for anyone but for</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.419" end="01:33:43.769" style="s2">particularly with PTSD and when it comes</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.769" end="01:33:46.349" style="s2">to confronting parts of ourselves that</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.769" end="01:33:50.969" style="s2">we find unsavory</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.349" end="01:33:55.199" style="s2">I guess it&#39;s always a if you attach</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.969" end="01:33:58.880" style="s2">yourself to another part of you you can</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.199" end="01:34:01.619" style="s2">go there more easily if you call on your</p>

<p begin="01:34:01.619" end="01:34:05.909" style="s2">that you know had the capacity to grow</p>

<p begin="01:34:49.050" end="01:34:53.940" style="s2">a relationship with that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.420" end="01:34:55.410" style="s2">really helpful that&#39;s a stunning answer</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.940" end="01:34:58.320" style="s2">really really beautiful minute so I</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.410" end="01:35:01.830" style="s2">think I&#39;m not really going to add to</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.320" end="01:35:04.770" style="s2">that but I&#39;m interested at the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.830" end="01:35:09.030" style="s2">philosophical level or how - there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.770" end="01:35:11.730" style="s2">another level of categorizing your own</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.030" end="01:35:14.730" style="s2">inner relationship with yourself when</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.730" end="01:35:17.580" style="s2">what you encounter can be so confronting</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.730" end="01:35:23.990" style="s2">anomalous Drive you into a state of fear</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.580" end="01:35:26.780" style="s2">or chaos I think there&#39;s some mixture of</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.990" end="01:35:29.670" style="s2">paying attention to that in a</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.780" end="01:35:32.850" style="s2">challenging way and then paying</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.670" end="01:35:35.300" style="s2">attention to that in a way of release or</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.850" end="01:35:39.570" style="s2">acceptance that seems to be at play</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.300" end="01:35:43.230" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s a time to wake up and</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.570" end="01:35:45.330" style="s2">identify with a particular content of</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.230" end="01:35:48.720" style="s2">experience and live that out and feel it</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.330" end="01:35:50.940" style="s2">and other times you sort of at least in</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.720" end="01:35:57.570" style="s2">my experience perhaps to just breathe</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.940" end="01:35:59.220" style="s2">and watch but this integration of what</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.570" end="01:36:03.900" style="s2">you can encounter in yourself that is</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.220" end="01:36:09.150" style="s2">scary or anomalous to you or disgusting</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.900" end="01:36:12.270" style="s2">is so key recognizing the different</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.150" end="01:36:17.160" style="s2">valence is the positive and negative</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.270" end="01:36:19.740" style="s2">feelings all part of one adaptive system</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.160" end="01:36:21.660" style="s2">but then yeah I mean though that the</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.740" end="01:36:24.180" style="s2">point about voluntary exposure I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.660" end="01:36:26.370" style="s2">is super crucial and that&#39;s why a</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.180" end="01:36:28.230" style="s2">certain setting and doing this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.370" end="01:36:30.270" style="s2">with as much responsibility and</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.230" end="01:36:33.360" style="s2">awareness as possible is so appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.270" end="01:36:37.410" style="s2">because there&#39;s no help whatsoever in</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.360" end="01:36:40.680" style="s2">throwing a baby into an ocean so gotta</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.410" end="01:36:42.600" style="s2">give that thing swimming lessons you one</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.680" end="01:36:43.530" style="s2">more question please and then one more</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.600" end="01:36:46.050" style="s2">question then we&#39;ll end</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.530" end="01:36:48.150" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ve heard of maps prism</p>

<p begin="01:36:53.130" end="01:36:58.110" style="s2">assuming that&#39;s based here Melbourne can</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.160" end="01:36:59.670" style="s2">you tell us a bit more about that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.110" end="01:37:02.670" style="s2">so my medicine Australia</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.670" end="01:37:05.730" style="s2">was first conceived of it it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.670" end="01:37:09.540" style="s2">last year or so and officially we opened</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.730" end="01:37:12.500" style="s2">as a charity like late last year and so</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.540" end="01:37:15.239" style="s2">we&#39;re a charity for health promotion for</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.500" end="01:37:19.199" style="s2">investigating communicating better</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.239" end="01:37:21.900" style="s2">understanding the potential of regulated</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.199" end="01:37:25.080" style="s2">and research back cyclic medicines and</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.900" end="01:37:29.070" style="s2">we seek to act as the hub or the nexus</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.080" end="01:37:31.620" style="s2">between academia between clinicians</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.070" end="01:37:34.650" style="s2">between the government regulatory bodies</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.620" end="01:37:37.260" style="s2">and also culture and to create real</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.650" end="01:37:42.719" style="s2">shifts in the perception and awareness</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.260" end="01:37:45.600" style="s2">of how these medicines may help a large</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.719" end="01:37:49.730" style="s2">proportion of our population who are</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.600" end="01:37:52.199" style="s2">currently experiencing mental illness so</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.730" end="01:37:54.989" style="s2">my medicine Australia I was actually a</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.199" end="01:37:57.090" style="s2">funding partner in the first Australian</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.989" end="01:38:00.090" style="s2">research trial with prism it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.090" end="01:38:02.489" style="s2">Vincents and we also seek to create a</p>

<p begin="01:38:02.489" end="01:38:09.210" style="s2">in a regulatory accredited environment</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.340" end="01:38:12.239" style="s2">for professionals we also will be</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.210" end="01:38:13.679" style="s2">running events a conference a</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.239" end="01:38:16.140" style="s2">large-scale international conference</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.679" end="01:38:18.840" style="s2">hopefully in the next year or so and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.140" end="01:38:21.840" style="s2">guess we are born of the fact that we</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.840" end="01:38:25.800" style="s2">are entering a new paradigm for mental</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.840" end="01:38:28.980" style="s2">health and that psychedelics are</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.800" end="01:38:31.980" style="s2">definitely a key aspect of this new</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.980" end="01:38:35.370" style="s2">paradigm and we also seek to incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.980" end="01:38:38.400" style="s2">other things like technology biomarkers</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.370" end="01:38:40.679" style="s2">virtual reality in time we&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.400" end="01:38:43.949" style="s2">innovation in mental health were not</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.679" end="01:38:46.890" style="s2">we&#39;re not our only focus on psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.949" end="01:38:49.230" style="s2">it is our key interest area because</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.890" end="01:38:52.140" style="s2">there&#39;s so much potential but in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.230" end="01:38:53.820" style="s2">future we want to see how do we treat</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.140" end="01:38:55.560" style="s2">the patient holistically I say</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.820" end="01:38:57.420" style="s2">holistically how do I treat how I treat</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.560" end="01:39:00.960" style="s2">both the body and the mind because</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.420" end="01:39:03.560" style="s2">they&#39;re so intimately related so we hope</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.960" end="01:39:06.270" style="s2">to have in the future when there is a</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.560" end="01:39:08.280" style="s2">regulatory approved psychedelic medicine</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.270" end="01:39:11.270" style="s2">we would like to have treatment centers</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.280" end="01:39:13.920" style="s2">that have a combination of psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.270" end="01:39:16.670" style="s2">classes both for</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.920" end="01:39:19.040" style="s2">being and psychological awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.670" end="01:39:23.190" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s a really exciting</p>

<p begin="01:39:34.410" end="01:39:38.940" style="s2">of volunteers helping us and this is</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.230" end="01:39:41.250" style="s2">something that we really need anyone</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.940" end="01:39:44.489" style="s2">who&#39;s interested in change in Australia</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.250" end="01:39:47.570" style="s2">to get on board with and a team</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.489" end="01:39:50.190" style="s2">statement earlier this is a great dinner</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.570" end="01:39:53.160" style="s2">conversation this is this is a great</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.190" end="01:39:55.830" style="s2">conversation starter and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.160" end="01:39:59.699" style="s2">surprised by the reception that you get</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.830" end="01:40:03.719" style="s2">I wear I&#39;m a cyclic compound around my</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.699" end="01:40:07.080" style="s2">neck and that&#39;s mainly to practice that</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.719" end="01:40:10.100" style="s2">first conversation about something that</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.080" end="01:40:13.170" style="s2">some people might see is impertinent but</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.100" end="01:40:15.660" style="s2">by the end as often the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.170" end="01:40:18.480" style="s2">scientific questions have been first</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.660" end="01:40:21.300" style="s2">impertinent it becomes pertinent when</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.480" end="01:40:25.100" style="s2">you communicate it I have my dad in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.300" end="01:40:30.110" style="s2">audience he&#39;s been a great supporter of</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.100" end="01:40:33.900" style="s2">my chosen career path and of my healing</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.110" end="01:40:35.820" style="s2">with psychedelics and that first</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.900" end="01:40:40.110" style="s2">conversation was a little scary for me</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.820" end="01:40:43.800" style="s2">my dad&#39;s a lawyer also a scientist</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.110" end="01:40:45.420" style="s2">thankfully and I&#39;ve noticed for example</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.800" end="01:40:47.429" style="s2">my mom is less of a scientist she&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.420" end="01:40:48.449" style="s2">of a feeler more of a heart centered</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.429" end="01:40:50.850" style="s2">person so I had a different conversation</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.449" end="01:40:53.190" style="s2">with her with my dad I spoke of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.850" end="01:40:55.320" style="s2">research studies I focused on the</p>

<p begin="01:40:57.210" end="01:41:02.370" style="s2">with PTSD with my mom it was more of a</p>

<p begin="01:41:02.370" end="01:41:08.580" style="s2">and a story of lateral thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.520" end="01:41:09.690" style="s2">could change lives so there&#39;s many ways</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.580" end="01:41:12.929" style="s2">to go about it</p>
