<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">here hi elizabeth how are you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">hi great thanks thanks for having me</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">back brett appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">so uh i thought i&#39;ve had this thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">it&#39;s been hovering just</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">outside of consciousness for some time</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">but i&#39;ve been thinking that in light of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">the fact that we have chosen</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">the campfire metaphor and for those who</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">are joining us for the first time let me</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">just say that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">we speak of campfire is that human</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">beings for millions of years have</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">gathered around fires and presumably as</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">our capacity to discuss difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">situations grew</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">people will have spent time around the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">campfire exchanging ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">what is going wrong and what might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">done about it so it seems the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">for for unity</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">so anyway what i had been thinking was</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">that perhaps there should be some fire</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">involved just sort of ceremonially</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">now i think i have suggested this too</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">late for greg to be able to get candles</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:43.039" style="s2">his studio but as it happens greg i have</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">an extra one</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.039" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">here for you elizabeth i think you were</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">able</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">to procure a candle we do not need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">know how you went about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">we assumed that it was for a good cause</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">and therefore your means</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">were surely justified so what i think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">should do is just light these candles</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">i can say elizabeth you&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">california are you oh you are in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">california</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">can you do us a favor please light these</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">candles very</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">carefully all right i will all right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna light a candle uh this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">for you greg</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">thank you brett i appreciate that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">no problem and uh i would just say</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">it is not an absolute requirement but</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">for people joining in the campfires</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">uh at home that it would be good</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">in the future if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">had a little fire you could bring to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">bear yourself um</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">all right good i tried to use a match</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">but it didn&#39;t work so i&#39;m using the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">barbecue lighter instead as a backup yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">just in case it gets cold around the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">campfire i did bring uh i did bring a</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">ways better than a lot of american candy</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">this is something that uh the english</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">thing for us to do is to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">where we are with respect to unity</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">uh what you all are seeing and uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">what it means so i i&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">this uh experience which i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">to some extent is being shared by both</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">of you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">where there are a small number of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:45.920" style="s2">that really get it they understand why</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">unity is necessary and they&#39;re on board</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.920" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">as elizabeth is seeing close-up there</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">literally hundreds of people working</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">tremendous numbers of hours to make this</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">and then we get a lot of interest from</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">people outside who</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">seem to be waiting for some indication</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">from the universe that</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">concerned about where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">with these two lesser evil choices</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">and to your point i&#39;m sorry for</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">but to your point i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">labels are often what are preventing us</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">from really</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">finding the collective spirit um we</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">we put these boxes around ourselves and</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">get out of them and then we surround</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">ourselves with people who also are</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">with those boxes and i think that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">of what we&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">in american society is</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">is a tie to some sort of some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">greater purpose and some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">american mythology</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">mythology to really live by and to and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">to aspire to the hero&#39;s journey is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">so important</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">for that kind of ability to see other</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">people in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">and to and to break down the walls that</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">i agree with you it&#39;s this it&#39;s the sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">of polarizing thing that we aren&#39;t able</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">to really get through because we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">of a known type to them it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">i&#39;m constantly facing being dismissed on</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">the basis that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">if i&#39;m not supporting biden for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">then that means i am supporting trump</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">and that i am doing so out of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">of defect of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">character right that this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">this is about making money somehow or i</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.919" style="s2">don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">but that that&#39;s such a small-minded way</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">of viewing things</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">and it blinds us to what i think is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">irony of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:45.880" style="s2">uh of the present moment at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">on the left side is there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.880" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">that if you love your country that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">don&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">right so it&#39;s as if people imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">there&#39;s an inconsistency betw</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">between being a progressive and being a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">patriot and i see no contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">whatsoever i want the country to to live</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">up to its</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">immense promise and that means both</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">seeing what&#39;s wonderful about it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">seeing where it hasn&#39;t quite gotten</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">there or where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">fallen backwards and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">so i wish people would just</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">leave open a space for discovering that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">that isn&#39;t of some type they&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">with but that has some</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">meaning that they should be should be</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s funny when we settled</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">on the idea of unity as a concept</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">you know it immediately resonated for us</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">for for very obvious reasons</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">but the number of other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">thinking about the same thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">number of places in history you know you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">point to these</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">these books um that have a lot to tell</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">us and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">this concept is resonant for so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">reasons at so many moments</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">so the final thing i&#39;ll say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">i think that people are missing</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">something very basic about</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">it is much easier to see what the nation</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">is not doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">for you than see what it is doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">for you and so this desire to tear the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">down is predicated on viewing</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">only one of those two categories if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">think all it is doing for you</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">is uh mistreating you then the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">well you would lose nothing by tearing</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">it down</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">but the problem is the stuff that works</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">really well</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">is more or less invisible right</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">the the bad interaction with police is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">and uh you know spreads like wildfire</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">the normal interactions with police are</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">uninteresting and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:54.799" style="s2">so i i wish there were some</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">mechanism there of course many literary</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.799" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">tropes about teleporting people into</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">some alternate reality where they get to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">see what would happen if their wishes</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:04.559" style="s2">were fulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">i wish that the people who are so eager</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.559" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">to tear the country down</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">could see what the world would look like</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">in its absence and just have some</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">that it would just give them some pause</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">about what it is that they are inviting</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly a disaster and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">need to make it happen in order to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">discover that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">and to that point i would say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">it&#39;s much more of a reactive</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">behavior than a responsive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">because if something</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">offends you or something triggers you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">then then</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re immediately upset and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s really difficult to actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">address the problem and to see through</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">to the end of a logical conclusion um</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">you know you get sort of like blind rage</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">or it just becomes very upsetting and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.159" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">instead i think that that that moment to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">respond</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">that breath is something that we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">time for i mean the world is just such a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">busy place how many notifications do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">get on your phone a day how many</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">scrolls do you do do you do on your</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">phone you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">um and there&#39;s and there&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">little time</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">to reflect and to and to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">what&#39;s going on around you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">i wholeheartedly agree with that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">that you know i&#39;ve mentioned to brett</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">before the reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">one of the themes of the respondent is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">how to be less reactive and more</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:28.400" style="s2">responsible we are all response able</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s no one person&#39;s fault no one is</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">to blame we are all responsible</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">and how can we come together um to tend</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:37.919" style="s2">i think you know to brett&#39;s point uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:37.919" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">the being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">uh into the future if you will um</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">or teleport into a time and place to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">able to see</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">where this is is leading um maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">wound</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">you know that those wounds the wound is</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">the place where the light enters you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">and the scar is the heel where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:04.640" style="s2">darkness leaves so perhaps there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">um it&#39;s a pre</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.640" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">cursor to what there may be some event</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">horizon</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">um you know i think we</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">when i first became aware of the word</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">woke</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">and when i started to see the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">the in a sense we&#39;re living in this era</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">of woke</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">capitalism in which companies pretend to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">care about</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:29.919" style="s2">pretend to care about social justice to</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">and you you just see it you see it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">everywhere you turn on the tv</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t watch network television</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">seen network television news maybe five</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">or six times in the last five years</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">it&#39;s sensational it&#39;s fear-based um</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">each side whether it be fox news or cnn</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">they&#39;re really missing two things</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a vision</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know whether to call it a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">slow motion train wreck but it&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">this faulty drama um it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a false fight and i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">uh the other aspect of it is that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:49.279" style="s2">parties</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:51.120" style="s2">all of the people who are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.279" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">the fight the one that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">at the top greg where when somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">something that just doesn&#39;t fit with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">script that you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">then you know they are the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">and you fight them as if they were</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">you know a pathogen or or a predator or</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">that that polarization</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">is it is turning everyone into useful</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">idiots</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">and if unity is something it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">a movement of people who are opting out</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">of the useful idiot category</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">and you know this is um it&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">thing to do because you will be</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">portrayed as out of touch</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">or worse you&#39;ll be portrayed as doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">the bidding of the greater evil as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">certainly talked about at length and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">not at all what the movement is like on</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">the inside</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:44.399" style="s2">on the inside it&#39;s decent people and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">people who are highly diverse and who</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">roughly</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">share a sense for where the country</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">should go it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">uh the same in any precise detail but</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">i i have the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">we cannot seem to escape the problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">that we are being demonized for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">and the reason is so that we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">heard and the reason that we mustn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">heard</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">is that if we were hearable it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">intuitive that you would want to be part</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">of the unity movement that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">even for selfish reasons that which one</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">has to gain</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">by being part of a movement that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">resisting the nation being torn apart</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">in this partisan battle is immense</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">so of course you would as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">get it you want to be on board with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">it is very important that it be</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">ungettable and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">um i guess there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.679" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">there is a fight that you might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">having with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">and then there is a fight that you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">induced to have with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">for their purpose and not yours and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">and the people you&#39;re fighting with</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">are actually not antagonists but you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">placed in that role because it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">necessary for somebody else&#39;s well-being</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">and i really wish there was some way</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">unfortunately i think that message will</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">be all too easily understood</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">of the content</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">we know why people who don&#39;t get it are</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">so hard to reach with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">so how do we escape that is there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">there an out</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">gosh really good question how how</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">is there an hour</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know is the honest answer i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:36.320" style="s2">there&#39;s doubt there isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">and from from my view what i see is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.320" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">this polarization and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">mainstream and social media</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">is so seems to be so ideologically</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">fixated around</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">how we might do more of it that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">i&#39;m here is to just kind of lend my</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">voice and see how i can help</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">i also do not know the answer um</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.960" style="s2">but i think i think part of part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.360" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">issue that i see especially when i talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.960" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">to people about unity</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">is that we&#39;re not ready or it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s something that i&#39;ve reflected</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">on a lot um</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:51.519" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that we&#39;re ever really</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">ready for the things that are most</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.519" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">important to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">our lives and to the like fulfillment of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">our lives</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">you know one of the most um impactful</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">things that either you</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">do or happen to you um you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">ready for</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">but there are you do have the skills and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">you have other other tools in your</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">toolbox that can help you get there and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">that can help you</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">make it through that and so i think a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">the readiness is or the the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">feeling ready</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">is the is a fear at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why fear-mongering works</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">so well</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">is because it preys on that lack of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.840" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">readiness around that lack of perceived</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">unreadiness</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">and it you know it has its way in it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t let you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">feel capable um to do the things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">and to join you know to to make a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">so i i agree with these things but i i</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">watching a tragedy and i don&#39;t mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">watching a tragedy unfold i mean i feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">almost watching a scripted tragedy where</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">i know what happens what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">people become</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">motivated to do the thing that they must</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">do when it&#39;s too late</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">people will get it they will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">get it but they will get it when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">too late</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">and so at some level how do you say</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:12.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as not ready</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">because what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">is coming at a rate right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">question about whether</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">you will act and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">be able to alter what&#39;s coming or</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">you won&#39;t act and then you will</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">experience the downstream consequences</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">of whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">and people don&#39;t get the rate the rate</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">incredibly fast and i mean you know just</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">even what we saw last night in wisconsin</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">right this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">we&#39;re watching something that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">a civil war now it&#39;s happening very</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">locally</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">it&#39;s happening as a result of an event</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">but um it does give us a hint</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">of what&#39;s down the road if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">figure out how to recognize each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">and so really the point is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">there is no ready or not ready you are</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">equally ready for both outcomes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">question is which</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:16.079" style="s2">path do you want to take it&#39;s a fork in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">the road and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.079" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">to take the standard fork is to allow</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">that you&#39;ve now had a chance to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">unfolding continue</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">and to take the other fork is to risk</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">the unknown definitely</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">but given what you know is progressing</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">why wouldn&#39;t you risk the unknown right</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense that you would um</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">you know that you would</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">uh head off the cliff because</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid that if you take the road</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t head off the cliff</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:49.359" style="s2">the answer might be worse and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">is it could be worse but</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.359" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">falling off a cliff is a terrible thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">right the chances that the other road</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:34:56.879" style="s2">actually goes somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">is enough that you should take that risk</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">have the guaranteed uh falling off a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">cliff phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:07.119" style="s2">this this reminds me of an old adage</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">that my my father used to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.119" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">um when you come to a fork in the road</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:14.839" style="s2">pick it up</p>

<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">um anyway yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">i mean the other thing is look uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">i think those of us on screen here</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">and those who have been on previous</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">campfires begin to tell another part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">the story</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">because i think we&#39;re facing the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">disaster as everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">but i feel like um</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">we actually are doing okay we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">you know other than the plan that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">have deployed we don&#39;t have some secret</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">escape mechanism from a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">where the nation comes apart</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.599" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s scary but i&#39;ve got to tell</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">you i think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">to the sense of stability</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">that arises from just simply discovering</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">that there are a lot of people who see</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">the same picture</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:14.400" style="s2">and that they are actually interested in</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">doing something about it rather than</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.400" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">spectating the disaster so i i wish that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">one of the things people would grasp</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">is we may not be able to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">right that&#39;s a fact on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">who do you want to be with as this</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">do you want to be with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">actually interested in taking a risk and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:36.480" style="s2">trying to do something new and different</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">averting a disaster or do you want to be</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">disaster</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">uh as you know a group of useful idiots</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">of one side or the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">right to me it&#39;s just a slam dunk</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">i agree i think uh i think planting your</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:39.119" style="s2">and i think you know people have said to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.720" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">it&#39;s been tried before and the third</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">party or the third ticket</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">i think we refer to it as so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">and they&#39;ve also worked it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">third parties have never worked i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying this is a party</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">it isn&#39;t it could become one but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">what it is it&#39;s a plan um but</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">third parties have succeeded and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">the thing is it&#39;s also true that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">are lots of patterns that you can find</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">where something has no precedent</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:12.000" style="s2">and then it happens and it does have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">precedent so</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.000" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">given the unusualness of the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">fact that this doesn&#39;t sound like</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:20.880" style="s2">something you&#39;ve seen work before</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean a damn thing yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.880" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">i agree and i think you know that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">is a lot of fear that you know i keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">coming back to the fear there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">fear i think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">um uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">fear-mongering a lot i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">lot of depression i think many people</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">are suffering right now everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">everyone suffers with something whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">um and many people living lives are</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">quiet desperation</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">um i see the the suicide rates rising</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s divorce rates rising there is just</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">and conversely at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:58.839" style="s2">we&#39;re actually i think you know in terms</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">of in general</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.839" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve i i hesitate to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve been living through uh peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">for the lasso but relatively speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">the stories that i heard from my</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">grandparents and parents growing up</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">um you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know there&#39;s this the sense i</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">people have mentioned to me recently</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:24.079" style="s2">depression there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">there&#39;s this almost like this depression</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.079" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">of america&#39;s personality</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">and that deep rest of depression this</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">dis-ease</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">of of america and um the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">the how do we address our national unity</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:42.800" style="s2">um you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">and that might be a touchstone for</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.800" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">reversing common feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">depression in the common collective and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">making people feel more positive and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">and moving away from from hateful to</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">grateful</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">and i think this virtual space is moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.280" end="00:40:01.760" style="s2">businesses from gray to green from</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">suburban metropolis and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.760" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">urban environments to to the nature and</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">wilderness and the countryside so i</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.440" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">think there are there are obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">positive things going</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">on but um all i&#39;ve seen of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">conventions</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">literally on both sides was a simple</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">simple message of vote for us</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">or die they&#39;ll kill you oh they&#39;ll kill</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">or you&#39;ll be dead they didn&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">covert we would handle it better and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">just goes</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it just goes up and up and up and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">what what good is that and it&#39;s fueled</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">by the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">it&#39;s fueled by no go ahead no please go</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:45.359" style="s2">ahead brother</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">i was just going to say um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.359" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">really unpatriotic it&#39;s anti-patriotic</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">and this is the thing that is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">get that all of the flags</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">involved and all of the claims of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:00.319" style="s2">patriotism are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">hollow because anybody who wishes to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">demonize another american right</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">now are there american demons there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s a small</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">number right most of the people who are</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">throats</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">that want to use your hatred of other</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">americans as the reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">that you should put them in power so</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">that they can then sell that power they</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">can pedal it to the highest bidder</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">that is unpatriotic and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">somehow it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">impossible to make that point because</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">these parties have branded patriotism</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve co-opted the idea of patriotism</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:57.839" style="s2">i think people have lost touch with what</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">it actually looks like</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.839" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">right and that that&#39;s what you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what unity is about and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">um we must hang together</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">or surely we will all hang separately</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:11.839" style="s2">right we&#39;re not talking about a literal</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">hanging in this case but we are talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.839" end="00:42:15.280" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">the same phenomenon and um</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.280" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just if only there was a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">to get people to just step out of their</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">mindset</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">long enough to listen with fresh ears</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">we&#39;d have a much better shot</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.839" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">so brett you said this earlier in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:34.240" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">that patriotism doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.240" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">love america without any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">uh qualms or that you know you just</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">patriotism so greg i&#39;d be really</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">did i realistically know that he had a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">realistic chance of winning no</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">did i believe he would win no if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">honest i didn&#39;t believe he would win</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">given the current system</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">did i believe in him and was i willing</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">to take</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:00.720" style="s2">take a stand for him and support him and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">speak for him</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.720" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">and plant my flag and say even though we</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">may be defeated</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">uh this is who i stand with yes and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">willing to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">every single time now and if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">cancelled if we</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t succeed who defines what</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">success is anyway</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">so i want to address a couple points</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:23.760" style="s2">that you raise</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">one i think we&#39;re a little bit confused</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.760" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">about the collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">aspect of the the woke</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">movement because there&#39;s nothing really</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:35.119" style="s2">wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">collectivism right not there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.119" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">collective aspect in fact unity</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">appeals to a certain collective desire</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">the problem is the de-individuation in</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">other words</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">we have a collective nature and we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">an individual nature and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">very real and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">very important and any movement that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">negates either one of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re so died in the wool</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:58.480" style="s2">libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">that all you see is the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.480" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand that there you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">you believe that self you&#39;re a self-made</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">person and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">the people you respect are all self made</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">well then you&#39;re not understanding</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">how we actually got where we are so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">the tension between these two things</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">and the de-individuated one is</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">particularly frightening</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">you know the most frightening movements</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">in history have been</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.760" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">predicated on a de-individuation that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">turns people into</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">cogs in a machine in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:31.040" style="s2">extremely dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">the other thing i wanted to say is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.040" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">i think that this</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">issue of you know patriotism isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:39.119" style="s2">nationalism i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">you said elizabeth i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.119" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">actually a very clean</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">distinction we can draw and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2">whether it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">what he had on his mind but i think jfk</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">actually did this one very</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.839" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">uh clearly ask not what your country can</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">do for you</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">ask what you can do for your country and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:01.599" style="s2">what your country can do for you you may</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">love your country because it does such</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.599" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">wonderful things for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s nationalism and your</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">willingness to sacrifice or to take</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">risks on behalf of your country that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">patriotism</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s where we are is at</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">this moment</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">the country desperately needs us to take</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">risks and to pay costs on its behalf so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">that it can continue</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">why would we do that because so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">depends on its continuing i mean in fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not just americans that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">depending on it it&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:35.680" style="s2">right the role america plays in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">world is vitally important which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.680" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">that we always get it right in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">have gotten it wrong many times</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">but the overarching impact</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">has been very positive and so many</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">nations have</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">followed us right the constitution which</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">you mentioned greg</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:58.000" style="s2">was a model for the free world and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:52:00.880" style="s2">um to undervalue</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.000" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">what was accomplished here and then to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.880" end="00:52:05.599" style="s2">destroy it</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.000" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">because of uh what isn&#39;t right about it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">either what actually isn&#39;t right about</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">it or what is perceived to not be right</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just such a gargantuan waste</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">i agree i i agree with you too</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">and i think though about</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">people who this country hasn&#39;t served</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:27.920" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:30.839" style="s2">when i do get into arguments or</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.920" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">discussions about patriotism and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.839" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">loving america and whatever way that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">it is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:42.559" style="s2">try to put myself in the shoes of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.559" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">have really not been served um by this</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">country at all and to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">and to and to appeal to them in a way</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:53.359" style="s2">that that really gets to them because</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">i think that that&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.359" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">profound that needs to be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:01.520" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">well i think the thing is we do know how</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.520" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">to do it and we were on the path</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:08.240" style="s2">and i believe progress stalled which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:08.960" style="s2">part of where the frustration is coming</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">from but</p>

<p begin="00:56:12.079" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">well um you know it&#39;s funny when the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.200" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">situation was happening i had this</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">student</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:23.280" style="s2">who you know as the thing was unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">she</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">had been there in fact she&#39;s in uh one</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">of the videos the first video that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">became famous from that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">that whole incident standing with me</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.839" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">this is a black woman</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">and anyway as the whole thing was</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:39.040" style="s2">unfolding she</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">said you know there&#39;s this kurt vonnegut</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.040" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">story you have to read it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">and i was of course not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">to things i had to read at all and she</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">was very persistent you have to read it</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">and um finally she persuaded me that</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">there was something in it i needed to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">read and so i did the story is harrison</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:59.440" style="s2">bergeron</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">and it is basically just simply a</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.440" end="00:57:02.160" style="s2">thought experiment about a quality of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">outcome and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.160" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">the absolute dystopia that</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">it produces right and she was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">right that this was</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">this was the core question um</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.839" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">so i think the thing is people are just</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">they&#39;re not thinking and they</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">detect that something is wrong but they</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">have understood</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">what is wrong incorrectly and so that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">they are having kind of an allergic</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">reaction against the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">um against a</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">fiction and unfortunately they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">credibly</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:42.480" style="s2">going to tear the country apart and even</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.480" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">i think unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">the the woke</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">side is actually very likely to drive</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">country into the arms of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">other party which is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">dragged towards its worst impulses by</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">the fact that we are now going to see</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">each other as</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">racially defined in other words that was</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.559" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">something that never went away</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:17.839" style="s2">but it was going away over long periods</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">of time it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.839" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">back with such a vengeance that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:25.119" style="s2">you know people have been told that they</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">are uh they&#39;re demonic because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.119" end="00:58:28.799" style="s2">white</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">they&#39;re white it&#39;s a kind of uh sin that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.799" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">they inherit it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">dispelled and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">um they are gonna begin to see</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">themselves as white first</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:40.960" style="s2">too and you know it&#39;s not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">there weren&#39;t people who saw it that way</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.960" end="00:58:43.839" style="s2">all along but</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:45.280" style="s2">the question is the mainstream is going</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.839" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">to start seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.280" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">in those terms and um</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">it&#39;s dystopias either way</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">yeah go ahead yeah greg you&#39;re so your</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">question also</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:02.400" style="s2">took me back to university um so no i</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">didn&#39;t go to evergreen but</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:08.400" style="s2">i definitely my university was um</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">this is what we learned we misdiagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.400" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:13.440" style="s2">and everyone got really upset about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.440" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">thing it seems uh looking back and i</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">mean i personally subscribed</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">to um very far left ideology for</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">quite some time uh i have some good</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:48.079" style="s2">when we get rid of trump the country&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:51.359" style="s2">fixed well that&#39;s absolutely false</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.079" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">um but it works because it&#39;s immediate</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.359" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">it&#39;s immediate gratification and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">like this is what you do and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:58.839" style="s2">outcome and it&#39;s a b</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="01:00:01.839" style="s2">c but there are many more letters in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.839" end="01:00:01.839" style="s2">alphabet</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.079" end="01:00:08.480" style="s2">so um oh go ahead greg</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2">no no i was i i was i&#39;m curious um</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.480" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">you know when we when we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">patriotism</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">you know what you said brett is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">that really</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.359" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">speaks to me in terms of um this</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:25.599" style="s2">the difference between patriotism and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.599" end="01:00:29.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m not going to suggest what the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:32.160" style="s2">difference is but to me</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.040" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">patriotism is that combination of</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.160" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">different feelings relating to and when</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">i say different they can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">you know aspirational and advocational</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">they can also be disappointed and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:45.680" style="s2">and let down in in your country but that</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.680" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">that that ethnic cultural political</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">historical</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">all of those those myriad of areas that</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:56.559" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">you can you know you can speak up about</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">and to and say look this this i have an</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">issue with this</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a real problem with this and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">right now i have a real problem with</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">america and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s the both the political parties</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the issue i have</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:11.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to speak out about it well</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:12.640" style="s2">how am i going to speak about it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.280" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">going to go on here i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.640" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">now some people may say he&#39;s got nothing</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:18.799" style="s2">to say i&#39;m not interested in it</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">so what um you know get involved</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.799" end="01:01:24.720" style="s2">have have a voice uh i think there is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">there is something to you know someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">once said the world we perceive as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:30.319" style="s2">dream we learn to have from a script we</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">have not written</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.319" end="01:01:37.760" style="s2">and and and perhaps that ideology is so</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:40.160" style="s2">extremely rooted um</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.760" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">you know to your point elizabeth i have</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.160" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">a friend of mine who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">ceo of a very successful company and she</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">was very</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">radical and extreme and woke and it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">conversation and discourse</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">over a long period of time that um</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">we conversed and she began to</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:02.640" style="s2">come back from the extreme and and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.799" end="01:02:04.720" style="s2">much so that she started to go towards</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.640" end="01:02:07.920" style="s2">the other extreme and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.720" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">be mindful to go the other way he just</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.920" end="01:02:11.359" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have to go the pendulum</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t swing too big</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.359" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">you know all right i think i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.599" end="01:02:18.240" style="s2">something it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">obvious really but uh it feels right to</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.240" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.000" end="01:02:25.920" style="s2">the question is which of uh you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">what the the wrinkle is here in a second</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.920" end="01:02:29.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:30.079" style="s2">the feeling of patriotism that we are</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.440" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">hunting</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.079" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">around here is very close kin</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:37.520" style="s2">with the love that one has for their</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.240" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.520" end="01:02:42.640" style="s2">right you can be livid at your children</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">right for something that they have done</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.640" end="01:02:45.599" style="s2">that is terribly wrong it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t love them doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.599" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.160" end="01:02:49.440" style="s2">jump in front of a train to save them</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:52.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.440" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">but the point is those things are</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.079" end="01:02:56.079" style="s2">completely consistent</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:57.119" style="s2">right you want your children to do well</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.079" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">you want them</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.119" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">to shine you want them to be the best</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">people they possibly can be</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">and if they&#39;re being the best people</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">they possibly can be then you can be</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:09.520" style="s2">proud as hell and if they&#39;re screwing up</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">you can be angry as hell but the point</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.520" end="01:03:12.799" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:15.039" style="s2">these are they&#39;re different axes right</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.799" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">your love for your country is not the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.039" end="01:03:18.319" style="s2">same thing as your belief that it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">doing everything right and in fact this</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.319" end="01:03:22.559" style="s2">is one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s i i find</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.559" end="01:03:25.839" style="s2">trump one of the most difficult</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">presidents</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.839" end="01:03:29.520" style="s2">in history to listen to right because</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">he&#39;s constantly telling</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.520" end="01:03:33.760" style="s2">us how everything we do is the best as</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">if the fact that it&#39;s us doing it</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.760" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">makes it the best right which is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:40.720" style="s2">non-sequitur at best</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:42.400" style="s2">um and anyway i i just</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.720" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">so the idea is there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.400" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">the familial love</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">that has the exact characteristic where</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">your your love for</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:55.200" style="s2">your family does not change because</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">you&#39;re disappointed in them right i love</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:03:57.760" style="s2">that</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:03.200" style="s2">ago about that notion that</p>

<p begin="01:07:04.240" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.960" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">in even having to have that thought like</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.440" end="01:07:15.839" style="s2">in a past year but we&#39;ve come to a place</p>

<p begin="01:07:15.839" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">in any way part of the same story</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.880" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">on the same team whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:23.839" style="s2">causes</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:26.079" style="s2">strangers to be able to smile at each</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.839" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">other and have a positive interaction</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.079" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">and know that there was no subtext right</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">that thing is being lost at an</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.640" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">incredible rate and</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">frankly i&#39;m angry about it right we have</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">even even if they&#39;re perceived to be</p>

<p begin="01:08:55.199" end="01:09:02.239" style="s2">you know i when i saw in my own country</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.239" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">and people urinating on it and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.199" end="01:09:08.960" style="s2">tear it down</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:09.759" style="s2">this is a man who it could be argued and</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.960" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">i know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.759" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">his his history has been rewritten in</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">the last few years</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:20.159" style="s2">apparently um that he single-handedly</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:22.960" style="s2">or at least led the he was the voice of</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.159" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">england during the second world war and</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.960" end="01:09:26.960" style="s2">really was that leader that stepped in</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:30.159" style="s2">love him into work but he had his issues</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.960" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">and he had like like most men all men</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.159" end="01:09:34.400" style="s2">he helped save the nation and and helped</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">bring together the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.400" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">the allied forces to help defeat true</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.920" end="01:09:42.799" style="s2">nazism not the neo-nazis we refer to</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.719" end="01:09:45.040" style="s2">today as the alt-right and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.799" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">um you know anyone who isn&#39;t radical</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.040" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">so i i&#39;ve been more perplexed</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:53.040" style="s2">than angry but there have been times</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:56.719" style="s2">when i&#39;ve been angry</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">um and what&#39;s so surprising about</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.719" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">those events and when that happens is</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:02.159" style="s2">why are we</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">why are we taking down churchill instead</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.159" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">of diving deeper into</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:07.760" style="s2">who else was there that made that happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:09.520" style="s2">because you know it wasn&#39;t just that one</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.760" end="01:10:11.199" style="s2">man he had a whole team of people there</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.520" end="01:10:12.159" style="s2">were so many people doing so many other</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.199" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.159" end="01:10:15.679" style="s2">that allowed for that to happen let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">tell more stories</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.679" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">instead of taking down one and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:21.280" style="s2">silencing the others</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:23.199" style="s2">well i would say i would say it a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.280" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">differently i would say that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.199" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2">the key thing is warts and all</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">right like let me confess i have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:34.640" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:35.600" style="s2">with the celebration of christopher</p>

<p begin="01:10:35.600" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">this one gets me i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">resonate with it and let me tell you why</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:49.280" style="s2">the fact of christopher columbus</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">is an absolute catastrophe for</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.280" end="01:10:54.640" style="s2">american indians right</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.400" end="01:10:56.800" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t all belong on</p>

<p begin="01:10:56.800" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">but some of it does and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:03.920" style="s2">the fact that we would celebrate</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.000" end="01:11:04.560" style="s2">christopher columbus as if he discovered</p>

<p begin="01:12:54.640" end="01:12:57.760" style="s2">strengths together that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.239" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">only picture that makes sense it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.760" end="01:13:02.719" style="s2">only one you would want to teach because</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:03.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the only one that gives anybody any</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.719" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">basis to know</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.760" end="01:13:09.760" style="s2">what to do with the information right so</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:11.360" style="s2">i think the thing is is history a matter</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.760" end="01:13:13.199" style="s2">of self-serving myths</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.360" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">or is history a description of what</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.199" end="01:13:16.159" style="s2">happened that has</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:18.719" style="s2">nuance and complexity that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.159" end="01:13:21.520" style="s2">grapple with it has to be the second</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.719" end="01:13:23.360" style="s2">right the former if we treat it as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.520" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">mythological space that we are allowed</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.360" end="01:13:26.640" style="s2">to paint</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:27.920" style="s2">uh in a way that reflects well on us and</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.640" end="01:13:30.800" style="s2">badly on others</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">then it just ends in a war of all</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.800" end="01:13:33.040" style="s2">against all which is where i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.040" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">headed</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.440" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about mythology is in</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.920" end="01:13:44.640" style="s2">in greek and roman times is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:47.199" style="s2">it is good and bad and a lot of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.640" end="01:13:47.760" style="s2">really gnarly and it&#39;s not just people</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.199" end="01:13:50.000" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.760" end="01:13:51.040" style="s2">who are doing the best in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.000" end="01:13:52.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t know they&#39;re like doing all</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.040" end="01:13:55.199" style="s2">these great things it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.239" end="01:13:56.400" style="s2">really crazy stories of people</p>

<p begin="01:13:56.400" end="01:14:02.000" style="s2">and failing epically and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.159" end="01:14:03.520" style="s2">maybe redeeming themselves maybe not but</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.000" end="01:14:05.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what we learn from we learn from</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.520" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">the mistakes and we can&#39;t be perfect</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.520" end="01:16:50.719" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to pretend anything</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.880" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen right</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.719" end="01:16:54.719" style="s2">but that the things we celebrate should</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:58.400" style="s2">be things that we can all</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.719" end="01:17:00.080" style="s2">celebrate right and um</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.400" end="01:17:02.159" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that that&#39;s the correct</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.080" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">resolution but it feels</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.159" end="01:17:07.280" style="s2">it feels right to me and</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:09.280" style="s2">you know i mean i think in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.280" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">this is built into the fabric of this</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.280" end="01:17:12.000" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.840" end="01:17:13.600" style="s2">why do i celebrate benjamin franklin</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.000" end="01:17:16.800" style="s2">he&#39;s not my ancestor</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.600" end="01:17:19.920" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly be right but</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:22.080" style="s2">he is my cultural ancestor</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.920" end="01:17:22.960" style="s2">right what benjamin franklin represents</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.080" end="01:17:25.679" style="s2">is something</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.960" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">that has descended through history to me</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.679" end="01:17:29.760" style="s2">and something that</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:31.040" style="s2">is laudable and something that i believe</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.760" end="01:17:32.719" style="s2">should be universal</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.040" end="01:17:34.960" style="s2">we should all feel ben franklin doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.719" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">matter your skin color doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.960" end="01:17:39.360" style="s2">you know what your faith might be ben</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">franklin was a great thinker and he was</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.360" end="01:17:43.199" style="s2">a great american thinker and</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.880" end="01:17:45.199" style="s2">we americans are in some sense descended</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.199" end="01:17:45.520" style="s2">from him irrespective of when we arrived</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.199" end="01:17:48.719" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.520" end="01:17:51.040" style="s2">by what mechanism and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.719" end="01:17:52.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i want i want a vision of</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.040" end="01:17:55.840" style="s2">unity in which</p>

<p begin="01:17:55.840" end="01:18:00.000" style="s2">that can truly be celebrated by us all</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.080" end="01:18:01.679" style="s2">and where all of us recognize the</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:04.159" style="s2">horrors of those</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.679" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">features of our history that you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.159" end="01:18:08.159" style="s2">were a win for some and a loss for</p>

<p begin="01:38:29.040" end="01:38:33.040" style="s2">percentage agreement</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.080" end="01:38:34.239" style="s2">from our audience using democracy ai is</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.040" end="01:38:37.520" style="s2">an interesting one</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.239" end="01:38:39.360" style="s2">um what key</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.520" end="01:38:40.800" style="s2">campaign finance and voting process</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.360" end="01:38:44.000" style="s2">reforms</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.800" end="01:38:46.080" style="s2">um not i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.000" end="01:38:49.199" style="s2">i understand this not first past the</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.080" end="01:38:51.119" style="s2">post are essential to save our democracy</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.199" end="01:38:53.280" style="s2">can you guys shed any light on that one</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.119" end="01:38:57.040" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re asking for</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.280" end="01:38:59.920" style="s2">what kinds of structural alterations we</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.040" end="01:39:01.920" style="s2">would want in order to fix the</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.920" end="01:39:02.960" style="s2">democratic process so that it is less</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.920" end="01:39:06.000" style="s2">prone to</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.960" end="01:39:09.600" style="s2">capture and to polarization</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.000" end="01:39:11.840" style="s2">things like that and so um i&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.600" end="01:39:12.639" style="s2">hesitant to be specific here and i would</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.840" end="01:39:16.719" style="s2">just point</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.639" end="01:39:19.760" style="s2">to the fact that the unity 2020</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.719" end="01:39:22.719" style="s2">proposal itself demonstrates</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.760" end="01:39:24.480" style="s2">that there is a way within the confines</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.719" end="01:39:26.159" style="s2">of our existing structure</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.480" end="01:39:27.679" style="s2">to do something that functions</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.159" end="01:39:31.199" style="s2">differently the</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.679" end="01:39:34.080" style="s2">fact of creating a an agreement</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.199" end="01:39:35.199" style="s2">a power sharing agreement under which</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.080" end="01:39:38.800" style="s2">our candidates</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.199" end="01:39:40.320" style="s2">will be drafted that demonstrates that</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.800" end="01:39:41.119" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually need to alter the</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.320" end="01:39:43.280" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.119" end="01:39:44.400" style="s2">structure of the constitution in order</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.280" end="01:39:47.520" style="s2">to change the way</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.400" end="01:39:49.440" style="s2">it functions so how many such</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.520" end="01:39:50.480" style="s2">alterations are there that one can</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.440" end="01:39:53.920" style="s2">envision</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.480" end="01:39:57.040" style="s2">where one doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.920" end="01:39:59.119" style="s2">take a scalpel to the</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.040" end="01:40:01.119" style="s2">structuring of the the rules of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.119" end="01:40:02.639" style="s2">nation in order to</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.119" end="01:40:04.880" style="s2">to alter where we end up i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.639" end="01:40:06.480" style="s2">how clear that is but my point is i</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.880" end="01:40:09.520" style="s2">don&#39;t want us</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.480" end="01:40:10.960" style="s2">to limit ourselves to thinking that what</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.520" end="01:40:14.560" style="s2">has to happen here</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.960" end="01:40:17.040" style="s2">is some kind of uh constitutional</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.560" end="01:40:17.520" style="s2">convention or its equivalent in order to</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.040" end="01:40:19.440" style="s2">fix</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.520" end="01:40:23.840" style="s2">how things work sometimes a little</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.440" end="01:40:23.840" style="s2">imagination is what it takes</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.040" end="01:40:29.440" style="s2">thanks um the next question that we have</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.520" end="01:40:33.520" style="s2">is i think we should move</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.440" end="01:40:35.600" style="s2">up sorry i think we should move</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.520" end="01:40:36.639" style="s2">i think we should move this movement off</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.600" end="01:40:39.119" style="s2">the internet</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.639" end="01:40:41.600" style="s2">how do we engage locally should we start</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.119" end="01:40:44.960" style="s2">crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.600" end="01:40:48.639" style="s2">um those seem to be two very different</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.960" end="01:40:51.040" style="s2">questions the movement can&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.639" end="01:40:52.639" style="s2">off the internet it can begin to do</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.040" end="01:40:54.719" style="s2">things that are not on the internet and</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.639" end="01:40:56.880" style="s2">i very much hope that will happen</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.719" end="01:40:57.920" style="s2">obviously kovid makes that really</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.880" end="01:41:00.719" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.920" end="01:41:01.920" style="s2">um because gathering in person is</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.719" end="01:41:03.920" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.920" end="01:41:05.679" style="s2">something that carries a certain amount</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.920" end="01:41:06.960" style="s2">of peril hopefully that clears up soon</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.679" end="01:41:08.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know when it will</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.960" end="01:41:10.800" style="s2">in the meantime we may be stuck with</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.960" end="01:41:14.320" style="s2">various kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.800" end="01:41:16.719" style="s2">internet phenomena um i&#39;m not sure why</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.320" end="01:41:20.239" style="s2">the funding question is linked</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.719" end="01:41:21.760" style="s2">to that all i can say about the funding</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.239" end="01:41:24.560" style="s2">is that there is</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.760" end="01:41:26.480" style="s2">um a world of possibilities that is</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.560" end="01:41:27.199" style="s2">opened up by substantial funding and</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.480" end="01:41:30.880" style="s2">then there are</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.199" end="01:41:32.560" style="s2">a great many regulations and</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.880" end="01:41:34.320" style="s2">hazards that accompany having the</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.560" end="01:41:37.679" style="s2">funding and that one should not</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.320" end="01:41:40.800" style="s2">plunge into it without looking</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.679" end="01:41:44.159" style="s2">first at the sum total of phenomena that</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.800" end="01:41:46.800" style="s2">you&#39;ll engage with if you do so</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.159" end="01:41:47.520" style="s2">but anyway yes engage with people</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.800" end="01:41:49.360" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.520" end="01:41:50.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it this is not supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.360" end="01:41:52.719" style="s2">a top-down</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.560" end="01:41:54.239" style="s2">movement this is you know campfire is</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.719" end="01:41:56.239" style="s2">chosen as a metaphor because people</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.239" end="01:41:58.320" style="s2">gather around campfires and</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.239" end="01:42:00.000" style="s2">you should take embers from our campfire</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.320" end="01:42:02.719" style="s2">and start your own and</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.000" end="01:42:04.400" style="s2">gather people and help them see what you</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.719" end="01:42:05.760" style="s2">can see and figure out what they have to</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.400" end="01:42:08.560" style="s2">teach you</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.760" end="01:42:10.080" style="s2">and sing songs of unity are we supposed</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.560" end="01:42:13.679" style="s2">to sing around a campfire</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.080" end="01:42:15.600" style="s2">we get later after a few toddies right</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.679" end="01:42:17.360" style="s2">well that&#39;s another thing that we i</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.600" end="01:42:18.719" style="s2">wondered whether or not it would set the</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.360" end="01:42:20.880" style="s2">right or the wrong tone if we were to</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.719" end="01:42:23.360" style="s2">share drinks around a campfire probably</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.880" end="01:42:25.040" style="s2">it would be uh an appropriate thing to</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.360" end="01:42:26.880" style="s2">do and we should consider it for future</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.040" end="01:42:29.760" style="s2">campfires</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.880" end="01:42:31.199" style="s2">but yes songs definitely yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.760" end="01:42:32.159" style="s2">maybe we just don&#39;t don&#39;t drink the</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.199" end="01:42:35.360" style="s2">kool-aid</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.159" end="01:42:37.600" style="s2">um in terms of uh in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.360" end="01:42:38.560" style="s2">for me campaign finance reform that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.600" end="01:42:40.480" style="s2">huge thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.560" end="01:42:43.119" style="s2">i think the system has a real conflict</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.480" end="01:42:45.280" style="s2">of interest right now real and perceived</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.119" end="01:42:46.560" style="s2">and it results when members seek and</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.280" end="01:42:48.320" style="s2">receive uh</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.560" end="01:42:50.239" style="s2">campaign contributions one of my</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.320" end="01:42:53.679" style="s2">particular areas</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.239" end="01:42:57.040" style="s2">of agitation or advocation is</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.679" end="01:42:59.760" style="s2">in marriage and family breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.040" end="01:43:01.679" style="s2">when i found out that the default shared</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.760" end="01:43:03.600" style="s2">parenting</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.679" end="01:43:06.560" style="s2">law which has been introduced in</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.600" end="01:43:09.679" style="s2">minnesota and arizona and kentucky</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.560" end="01:43:10.080" style="s2">to reform family law had only been</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.679" end="01:43:11.679" style="s2">passed</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.080" end="01:43:13.280" style="s2">in kentucky and the reason it was passed</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.679" end="01:43:15.520" style="s2">was because in kentucky the state</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.280" end="01:43:17.199" style="s2">legislature cannot be lobbied by law</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.520" end="01:43:18.320" style="s2">firms and attorneys and family law</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.199" end="01:43:20.480" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.320" end="01:43:22.239" style="s2">i think uh personally i i think the</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.480" end="01:43:24.239" style="s2">breakdown of the family is the</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.239" end="01:43:26.719" style="s2">single biggest civilizational</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.239" end="01:43:28.320" style="s2">catastrophe we might be facing today</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.719" end="01:43:29.840" style="s2">and perhaps the greatest indicator at</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.320" end="01:43:32.239" style="s2">the root of america&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.840" end="01:43:33.280" style="s2">torn familial tapestry is marriage and</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.239" end="01:43:35.920" style="s2">family breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.280" end="01:43:37.040" style="s2">social ills and public policy stem from</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.920" end="01:43:39.199" style="s2">the health and well-being of</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.040" end="01:43:42.239" style="s2">relationships and family formation</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.199" end="01:43:44.960" style="s2">and that personality um of</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.239" end="01:43:45.920" style="s2">america which seems to be disordered uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.960" end="01:43:49.760" style="s2">somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.920" end="01:43:53.840" style="s2">is um it&#39;s rooted in that</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.760" end="01:43:57.360" style="s2">that lack of cross-partisan um</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.840" end="01:43:58.080" style="s2">relational ships and relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.360" end="01:44:00.080" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.080" end="01:44:01.600" style="s2">people talk and discourse across the</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.080" end="01:44:05.040" style="s2">aisle so</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.600" end="01:44:08.239" style="s2">i think taking some of the money out of</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.040" end="01:44:11.520" style="s2">um family of promoting</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.239" end="01:44:13.040" style="s2">family breakdown it would be huge</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.520" end="01:44:14.560" style="s2">and i think uh obviously the</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.040" end="01:44:16.080" style="s2">pharmaceutical industry there were so</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.560" end="01:44:19.679" style="s2">many industries and</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.080" end="01:44:20.800" style="s2">um campaign finance reform for me is is</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.679" end="01:44:24.239" style="s2">a big one</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.800" end="01:44:26.880" style="s2">well so uh campaign finance reform</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.239" end="01:44:27.760" style="s2">has long been a signature issue for me</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.880" end="01:44:31.040" style="s2">but i</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.760" end="01:44:34.560" style="s2">almost wonder if we</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.040" end="01:44:35.679" style="s2">uh it is important but insufficient at</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.560" end="01:44:37.199" style="s2">this point there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.679" end="01:44:38.880" style="s2">earlier moment in our history where</p>

<p begin="01:44:38.880" end="01:44:42.400" style="s2">sufficient to</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.840" end="01:44:43.280" style="s2">to right the ship of state but i i think</p>

<p begin="01:44:43.280" end="01:44:48.239" style="s2">time has passed but i would point out</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.600" end="01:44:50.560" style="s2">that this is actually a good example of</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.239" end="01:44:52.080" style="s2">something that could be dealt with by</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.560" end="01:44:53.920" style="s2">structural reform</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.080" end="01:44:55.520" style="s2">one that is actually hard to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.920" end="01:44:56.800" style="s2">because there is so much money in our</p>

<p begin="01:44:56.800" end="01:45:00.320" style="s2">but it could also be dealt with in some</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.880" end="01:45:01.440" style="s2">other way that doesn&#39;t involve the</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.320" end="01:45:04.800" style="s2">formality</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.440" end="01:45:05.360" style="s2">which is to say people could stop</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.800" end="01:45:07.199" style="s2">electing</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.360" end="01:45:08.639" style="s2">politicians that take money from</p>

<p begin="01:45:08.639" end="01:45:14.320" style="s2">and this is something you uh</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.080" end="01:45:16.159" style="s2">do not require anyone&#39;s permission to do</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.320" end="01:45:19.199" style="s2">and we&#39;ve in fact seen</p>

<p begin="01:45:23.520" end="01:45:28.159" style="s2">so there are many ways to uh to get</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.000" end="01:45:30.480" style="s2">there the necessity of taking</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.159" end="01:45:32.080" style="s2">money out of politics is absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.480" end="01:45:33.360" style="s2">clear i would say it is a corrosive</p>

<p begin="01:47:08.400" end="01:47:11.520" style="s2">uh well below the level of governance</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.480" end="01:47:15.280" style="s2">there&#39;s something</p>

<p begin="01:47:15.280" end="01:47:20.159" style="s2">seeking to induce desires in young</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.560" end="01:47:21.040" style="s2">people because it gets them to spend</p>

<p begin="01:47:31.119" end="01:47:35.520" style="s2">emerging as you point out elizabeth is a</p>

<p begin="01:47:35.520" end="01:47:38.560" style="s2">may have something to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.040" end="01:47:41.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.560" end="01:47:42.880" style="s2">a force for its own economic reasons</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.280" end="01:47:44.400" style="s2">interfering</p>

<p begin="01:47:53.679" end="01:47:57.199" style="s2">political objectives but um but</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.000" end="01:48:00.400" style="s2">certainly it&#39;s something that needs to</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.199" end="01:48:02.000" style="s2">be thought of in the larger context</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.400" end="01:48:03.520" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s a really good point</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.000" end="01:48:06.639" style="s2">that you make elizabeth</p>

<p begin="01:57:09.760" end="01:57:15.360" style="s2">and accuse it of inviting danger or</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.199" end="01:57:16.320" style="s2">you know being implausible or being</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.360" end="01:57:19.440" style="s2">about something else</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.320" end="01:57:21.679" style="s2">but the parties announced to us</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.440" end="01:57:23.280" style="s2">that they are ready to roll the dice on</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.679" end="01:57:24.880" style="s2">the future of this country they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="02:02:25.040" end="02:02:28.239" style="s2">this is the tragedy of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.719" end="02:02:31.199" style="s2">is we are actually</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.239" end="02:02:32.560" style="s2">losing that and we are defaulting to an</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.199" end="02:02:35.760" style="s2">ancient mode</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.560" end="02:02:37.920" style="s2">that is detestable a mode in which</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.760" end="02:02:39.599" style="s2">we fight people because of something</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.920" end="02:02:41.760" style="s2">they had no choice about</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.599" end="02:02:43.679" style="s2">right who they who they are at the level</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.760" end="02:02:45.360" style="s2">of their immutable characteristics</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.679" end="02:02:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s such a stupid thing to fight over</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.360" end="02:02:49.840" style="s2">that that&#39;s your genes in charge</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.840" end="02:02:51.760" style="s2">and if there&#39;s one thing i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.840" end="02:02:53.119" style="s2">from studying evolution</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.760" end="02:02:54.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t want your genes to be in</p>

<p begin="02:02:54.800" end="02:03:00.560" style="s2">is uh arbitrary a lot of it&#39;s immoral</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.239" end="02:03:01.760" style="s2">and the fact that america aspires to</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.560" end="02:03:04.800" style="s2">something better</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.760" end="02:03:06.960" style="s2">and that the free world followed us</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.800" end="02:03:08.960" style="s2">because what it aspired to was so</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.960" end="02:03:11.920" style="s2">beautiful and so desirable</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.960" end="02:03:13.920" style="s2">that it was irresistible how can we lose</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.920" end="02:03:16.960" style="s2">the courage of our convictions now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.920" end="02:03:16.960" style="s2">just a terrible error</p>

<p begin="02:04:24.000" end="02:04:28.560" style="s2">i absolutely categorically reject i</p>

<p begin="02:04:41.760" end="02:04:46.079" style="s2">i resonate with that is just the one</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.679" end="02:04:47.840" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.079" end="02:04:49.440" style="s2">it was that one word i&#39;m i&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.840" end="02:04:51.599" style="s2">to be able to get past it you know that</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.440" end="02:04:53.360" style="s2">may be a personal defect i would accept</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.599" end="02:04:54.960" style="s2">that interpretation but nonetheless i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.360" end="02:04:57.360" style="s2">not going to budge</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.960" end="02:04:58.320" style="s2">well i&#39;ve come out with a few different</p>

<p begin="02:05:19.360" end="02:05:24.880" style="s2">couples to protect their marijuana with</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.119" end="02:05:28.560" style="s2">ar-15s if that makes them happy</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.880" end="02:05:31.199" style="s2">it&#39;s powerful the ar-15s are powerful</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.560" end="02:05:32.000" style="s2">as is marijuana now that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.199" end="02:05:35.840" style="s2">concentrated</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.000" end="02:05:35.840" style="s2">i&#39;m getting high or i&#39;ll shoot</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.400" end="02:05:41.840" style="s2">yeah um yeah that&#39;s a look i don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="02:05:41.840" end="02:05:49.360" style="s2">but otherwise i&#39;m on board</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.280" end="02:05:49.360" style="s2">with that view um shouldn&#39;t have to um</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.639" end="02:05:54.960" style="s2">um and we can we can close this question</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.840" end="02:05:56.400" style="s2">with this answer</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.960" end="02:05:58.560" style="s2">uh that we don&#39;t come from the same</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.400" end="02:06:00.320" style="s2">place literally or metaphorically but we</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.560" end="02:06:01.280" style="s2">agreed to work together to be in a place</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.320" end="02:06:04.159" style="s2">worth living in</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.280" end="02:06:04.159" style="s2">and dying for</p>

<p begin="02:06:13.040" end="02:06:16.320" style="s2">maybe two years ago i said something</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.880" end="02:06:19.679" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.320" end="02:06:22.159" style="s2">patriotism on twitter and</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.679" end="02:06:24.079" style="s2">i got this pushback that there was</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.159" end="02:06:26.000" style="s2">disbelief that there was any patriotism</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.079" end="02:06:27.679" style="s2">on the left</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.000" end="02:06:29.840" style="s2">and i know what it was about because i</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.679" end="02:06:32.880" style="s2">see a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.840" end="02:06:34.639" style="s2">tearing down of america and minimizing</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.880" end="02:06:36.079" style="s2">its accomplishments and things like that</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.639" end="02:06:38.639" style="s2">on the left but i</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.079" end="02:06:40.960" style="s2">also come from a tradition that is</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.639" end="02:06:43.440" style="s2">patriotic and does</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.960" end="02:06:44.880" style="s2">want to see the country live up to its</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.440" end="02:06:48.880" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.880" end="02:06:51.280" style="s2">and i feel like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.880" end="02:06:52.960" style="s2">hopefully the unity movement has had</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.280" end="02:06:54.560" style="s2">something to do with it but i hear</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.960" end="02:06:57.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.560" end="02:06:59.040" style="s2">wrestling with their own subconscious</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.760" end="02:07:02.320" style="s2">and discovering</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.040" end="02:07:06.000" style="s2">that they actually are comfortable with</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.320" end="02:07:09.360" style="s2">this um this patriotic</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.000" end="02:07:11.280" style="s2">collective view of what we are as a</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.360" end="02:07:15.199" style="s2">nation and what we might be</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.280" end="02:07:16.320" style="s2">and you know i hope we accomplish more i</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.199" end="02:07:19.760" style="s2">hope we</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.320" end="02:07:22.000" style="s2">find a way to recapture the white house</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.760" end="02:07:25.119" style="s2">but whether we do that or not</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.000" end="02:07:26.320" style="s2">seeing people find each other and look</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.119" end="02:07:28.079" style="s2">each other in the eye</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.320" end="02:07:29.360" style="s2">on the basis of this shared</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.079" end="02:07:32.400" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.360" end="02:07:35.760" style="s2">of what we are um is</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.400" end="02:07:36.400" style="s2">very heartening so i&#39;m enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.760" end="02:07:38.239" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.400" end="02:07:39.920" style="s2">about the fact that we you can even hear</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.239" end="02:07:42.960" style="s2">that in the responses to these questions</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.920" end="02:07:42.960" style="s2">very clearly i think</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.880" end="02:07:50.560" style="s2">yeah go ahead</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.400" end="02:07:51.840" style="s2">oh um i was just gonna move on to the</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.560" end="02:07:54.320" style="s2">next question that i think</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.840" end="02:07:56.000" style="s2">uh brett asked what do friends and</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.320" end="02:07:57.199" style="s2">family say when you talk to them about</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.000" end="02:08:00.639" style="s2">unity</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.199" end="02:08:04.159" style="s2">and unfortunately it&#39;s a little less</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.639" end="02:08:07.040" style="s2">positive than we might have hoped um but</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.159" end="02:08:08.000" style="s2">uh the top answer was that most people</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.040" end="02:08:09.760" style="s2">say it won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.000" end="02:08:11.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve been able to get through a few and</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.760" end="02:08:13.840" style="s2">they joined the movement</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.599" end="02:08:15.599" style="s2">um so people are also looking at this</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.840" end="02:08:16.480" style="s2">like a movement which i think is good</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.599" end="02:08:18.159" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.480" end="02:08:20.800" style="s2">you know sort of the long-term vision of</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.159" end="02:08:24.000" style="s2">what what we deserve as americans</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.800" end="02:08:24.880" style="s2">um there&#39;s a lot of skepticism that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.000" end="02:08:26.719" style="s2">seeing here</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.880" end="02:08:28.320" style="s2">in in the answers they don&#39;t feel safe</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.719" end="02:08:31.440" style="s2">with the idea</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.320" end="02:08:33.440" style="s2">um and yeah a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.440" end="02:08:34.639" style="s2">it won&#39;t work and i think that this</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.440" end="02:08:36.480" style="s2">speaks to</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.639" end="02:08:38.960" style="s2">sort of the frames and mental models</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.480" end="02:08:41.679" style="s2">that we that we create</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.960" end="02:08:42.480" style="s2">and that are and that we live in um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.679" end="02:08:44.480" style="s2">really hard</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.480" end="02:08:45.920" style="s2">to to walk outside of those and to</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.480" end="02:08:47.679" style="s2">imagine something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.920" end="02:08:49.280" style="s2">never happened before that we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.679" end="02:08:52.159" style="s2">seen um</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.280" end="02:08:52.960" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s possible i mean it has</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.159" end="02:08:56.880" style="s2">to be possible</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.960" end="02:08:59.840" style="s2">right well the other thing to say is um</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.880" end="02:09:01.360" style="s2">the self-fulfilling aspect of saying</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.840" end="02:09:03.119" style="s2">that it&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.360" end="02:09:04.159" style="s2">is a little bit hard to get past if</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.119" end="02:09:05.679" style="s2">you&#39;re in the movement because it</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.159" end="02:09:08.000" style="s2">absolutely is possible</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.679" end="02:09:09.599" style="s2">it may not happen why won&#39;t it happen</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.000" end="02:09:10.880" style="s2">because people have told themselves that</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.599" end="02:09:12.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.880" end="02:09:15.119" style="s2">why do they tell themselves that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.480" end="02:09:16.960" style="s2">not possible in part because the parties</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.119" end="02:09:19.520" style="s2">have made this very difficult</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.960" end="02:09:20.000" style="s2">and they have assured you that anybody</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.520" end="02:09:21.920" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.000" end="02:09:25.040" style="s2">would think about possibilities like</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.920" end="02:09:27.920" style="s2">this is either stupid or a traitor</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.040" end="02:09:28.320" style="s2">right you&#39;re electing the greater evil</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.920" end="02:09:30.960" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.320" end="02:09:31.440" style="s2">you&#39;re just too dumb to get why it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.960" end="02:09:34.480" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.440" end="02:09:37.679" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.480" end="02:09:39.599" style="s2">the fact is it either will work</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.679" end="02:09:41.679" style="s2">or something else will eventually work</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.599" end="02:09:43.840" style="s2">or we will die from it not working</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.679" end="02:09:45.440" style="s2">right we will tear ourselves apart</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.840" end="02:09:47.920" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.440" end="02:09:49.920" style="s2">people lack imagination to see another</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.920" end="02:09:52.480" style="s2">possibility when the other possibility</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.920" end="02:09:53.599" style="s2">i mean this isn&#39;t like somebody is</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.480" end="02:09:55.679" style="s2">asking you to</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.599" end="02:09:57.199" style="s2">literally go charge a hill with a</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.679" end="02:09:59.679" style="s2">machine gun nest on it</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.199" end="02:10:00.320" style="s2">this is a question of being willing to</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.679" end="02:10:04.079" style="s2">confront</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.320" end="02:10:05.760" style="s2">parties and tell them no and vote</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.079" end="02:10:07.520" style="s2">right that&#39;s very simple and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.760" end="02:10:10.800" style="s2">comparatively safe</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.520" end="02:10:12.639" style="s2">but um the parties have done a very</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.800" end="02:10:15.840" style="s2">effective job of convincing people that</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.639" end="02:10:15.840" style="s2">there is no other way</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.920" end="02:10:23.920" style="s2">and to that point um the</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.360" end="02:10:25.119" style="s2">the top so the fourth most popular</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.920" end="02:10:26.639" style="s2">answer was um</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.119" end="02:10:28.719" style="s2">most are receptive but doubt it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.639" end="02:10:30.159" style="s2">practicality the politically disaffected</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.719" end="02:10:31.360" style="s2">are the most receptive</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.159" end="02:10:33.119" style="s2">and i just want you all to know out</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.360" end="02:10:34.159" style="s2">there that over half of the people</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.119" end="02:10:36.719" style="s2">participating</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.159" end="02:10:38.560" style="s2">are politically disaffected as they uh</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.719" end="02:10:39.199" style="s2">highlighted in the onboarding questions</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.560" end="02:10:42.239" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.199" end="02:10:44.719" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re here i mean</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.239" end="02:10:45.760" style="s2">we are receptive like this is this is a</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.719" end="02:10:47.280" style="s2">home for you</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.760" end="02:10:48.880" style="s2">if you are politically disaffected or</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.280" end="02:10:51.760" style="s2">you feel like you don&#39;t belong on</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.880" end="02:10:52.800" style="s2">either of the side of the aisle um you</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.760" end="02:10:56.079" style="s2">you belong here</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.800" end="02:10:58.639" style="s2">you belong in unity so this is</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.079" end="02:11:00.159" style="s2">such an important point the parties have</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.639" end="02:11:03.280" style="s2">played a cynical game</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.159" end="02:11:04.079" style="s2">because they don&#39;t care whether most</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.280" end="02:11:06.560" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.079" end="02:11:08.079" style="s2">vote for them what they need is enough</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.560" end="02:11:09.679" style="s2">americans to vote for them that they</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.079" end="02:11:10.719" style="s2">have power that they can then sell to</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.679" end="02:11:12.560" style="s2">the highest bidder</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.719" end="02:11:14.320" style="s2">that can be a tiny fraction of americans</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.560" end="02:11:17.040" style="s2">so they have played</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.320" end="02:11:18.800" style="s2">a very toxic game because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.040" end="02:11:20.079" style="s2">matter to them that they have turned off</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.800" end="02:11:23.840" style="s2">most americans</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.079" end="02:11:25.599" style="s2">to the questions of governance the fact</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.840" end="02:11:29.199" style="s2">that unity seems to bring</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.599" end="02:11:29.520" style="s2">so many people back into the question of</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.199" end="02:11:32.960" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.520" end="02:11:36.079" style="s2">are we to live is</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.960" end="02:11:38.800" style="s2">very heartening and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.079" end="02:11:39.840" style="s2">unity to capture the attention of simply</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.800" end="02:11:42.400" style="s2">that group of people</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.840" end="02:11:43.440" style="s2">the disaffected it would be the largest</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.400" end="02:11:46.719" style="s2">uh movement</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.440" end="02:11:48.719" style="s2">in the country and so um</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.719" end="02:11:50.239" style="s2">maybe this is really what the parties</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.719" end="02:11:53.920" style="s2">are telling us is</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.239" end="02:11:55.760" style="s2">that those who uh are partisans</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.920" end="02:11:58.079" style="s2">are going to be unreachable because</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.760" end="02:11:59.440" style="s2">they&#39;re robots they&#39;ve been programmed</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.079" end="02:12:01.599" style="s2">not to be reachable</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.440" end="02:12:03.840" style="s2">that&#39;s their mechanism for never having</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.599" end="02:12:07.040" style="s2">to deal with real competition</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.840" end="02:12:07.840" style="s2">but that the the fatal error is that</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.040" end="02:12:10.639" style="s2">they have turned</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.840" end="02:12:12.079" style="s2">so many people off that if those people</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.639" end="02:12:13.360" style="s2">can be alerted to</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.079" end="02:12:15.360" style="s2">the fact that there is something that</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.360" end="02:12:21.280" style="s2">can be done um</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.360" end="02:12:24.719" style="s2">then in the end we will win</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.280" end="02:12:26.000" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve already won there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.719" end="02:12:28.239" style="s2">winning to be had</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.000" end="02:12:30.079" style="s2">i mean part of the i get the goal and</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.239" end="02:12:33.599" style="s2">the purpose the end game</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.079" end="02:12:35.760" style="s2">but i also think that that that you know</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.599" end="02:12:38.079" style="s2">maybe there are disaffected people who</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.760" end="02:12:39.920" style="s2">who have found the articles of unity but</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.079" end="02:12:42.320" style="s2">i also think there are people who</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.920" end="02:12:43.280" style="s2">who will begin to find the articles of</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.320" end="02:12:46.719" style="s2">unity</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.280" end="02:12:48.400" style="s2">that are in either one of the two camps</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.719" end="02:12:50.800" style="s2">that will just be</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.400" end="02:12:52.000" style="s2">drawn to a conversation that isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.800" end="02:12:55.040" style="s2">toxic that isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.000" end="02:12:58.480" style="s2">shame rage cyclical it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.040" end="02:13:00.880" style="s2">human kryptonite of it&#39;s us or them</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.480" end="02:13:02.480" style="s2">and if you&#39;re with you&#39;re not with us</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.880" end="02:13:05.840" style="s2">then you&#39;re with them and</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.480" end="02:13:08.719" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be um multiple</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.840" end="02:13:10.159" style="s2">hidden bonuses and positives to to a</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.719" end="02:13:14.400" style="s2">conversation that</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.159" end="02:13:16.800" style="s2">in is inclusive rather than exclusive</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.400" end="02:13:18.000" style="s2">hasn&#39;t that oh absolutely i mean and in</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.800" end="02:13:20.719" style="s2">fact many of the</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.000" end="02:13:22.400" style="s2">disaffected reside inside the parties i</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.719" end="02:13:23.920" style="s2">i was one i still am one</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.400" end="02:13:26.000" style="s2">i&#39;m a registered democrat and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.920" end="02:13:28.480" style="s2">described myself for a decade</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.000" end="02:13:29.199" style="s2">as the world&#39;s most reluctant democrat</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.480" end="02:13:31.679" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.199" end="02:13:32.560" style="s2">because i see the game why don&#39;t i leave</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.679" end="02:13:36.079" style="s2">the party</p>
<p begin="02:13:32.560" end="02:13:37.840" style="s2">because i want to vote for andrew yang</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.079" end="02:13:39.599" style="s2">and tulsi gabbard</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.840" end="02:13:41.840" style="s2">in the hope that they can eventually</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.599" end="02:13:43.760" style="s2">outfox the dnc but do i expect it to</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.840" end="02:13:46.400" style="s2">happen inside the democratic party</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.760" end="02:13:47.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t so anyway i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.400" end="02:13:49.360" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.599" end="02:13:50.719" style="s2">see it that way they&#39;re in a party</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.360" end="02:13:53.520" style="s2">because they have</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.719" end="02:13:54.800" style="s2">in an absolute sense somewhat more power</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.520" end="02:13:58.400" style="s2">there but that power never</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.800" end="02:14:00.719" style="s2">manifests anything the dnc is exhibited</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.400" end="02:14:03.119" style="s2">ample capacity to shut down anything</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.719" end="02:14:06.560" style="s2">that would represent positive change</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.119" end="02:14:08.320" style="s2">um i would say trump defeated the rnc</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.560" end="02:14:09.760" style="s2">and he has now taken over</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.320" end="02:14:11.840" style="s2">their party so that&#39;s at least a</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.760" end="02:14:13.119" style="s2">different story even if not necessarily</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.840" end="02:14:17.679" style="s2">a hopeful one</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.119" end="02:14:19.520" style="s2">but but yes the disaffected reside</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.679" end="02:14:21.280" style="s2">outside of the parties and inside of the</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.520" end="02:14:27.199" style="s2">parties and</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.280" end="02:14:30.159" style="s2">they are the ones we must reach</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.199" end="02:14:31.679" style="s2">so i think one um one final question</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.159" end="02:14:33.679" style="s2">that i think would be really good to</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.679" end="02:14:36.719" style="s2">to send us off here is a question from</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.679" end="02:14:38.239" style="s2">the audience and the question is this</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.719" end="02:14:40.320" style="s2">how do we get this movement talked about</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.239" end="02:14:41.119" style="s2">in the media on large platforms and</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.320" end="02:14:43.599" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="02:14:41.119" end="02:14:45.840" style="s2">of and i&#39;m adding this last part but</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.599" end="02:14:48.719" style="s2">outside of</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.840" end="02:14:49.199" style="s2">maybe the the spaces that are controlled</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.719" end="02:14:54.239" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.199" end="02:14:57.440" style="s2">tightly monitored by the parties</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.239" end="02:14:58.239" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great question and in some</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.440" end="02:15:02.880" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.239" end="02:15:05.280" style="s2">um i think we have to open our eyes</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.880" end="02:15:05.920" style="s2">there is a force that doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.280" end="02:15:07.760" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.920" end="02:15:10.639" style="s2">why because it&#39;s the way things are</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.760" end="02:15:12.639" style="s2">structured is very profitable for it</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.639" end="02:15:15.360" style="s2">it not only controls the parties but it</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.639" end="02:15:18.880" style="s2">controls our</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.360" end="02:15:21.920" style="s2">media sufficient to prevent</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.880" end="02:15:23.040" style="s2">movements outside from gaining hold we</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.920" end="02:15:26.400" style="s2">have seen</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.040" end="02:15:27.119" style="s2">that the control is weakening bernie</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.400" end="02:15:28.639" style="s2">sanders</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.119" end="02:15:30.639" style="s2">showed that it was weakening donald</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.639" end="02:15:32.719" style="s2">trump showed that it was weakening</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.639" end="02:15:34.560" style="s2">uh andrew yang showed that it was</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.719" end="02:15:35.599" style="s2">weakening tulsi gabbard showed that it</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.560" end="02:15:38.880" style="s2">was weakening</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.599" end="02:15:39.840" style="s2">and so i think the point is we have to</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.880" end="02:15:42.159" style="s2">defeat it</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.840" end="02:15:43.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to let us in but if it</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.159" end="02:15:46.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t let us in</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.840" end="02:15:48.159" style="s2">it&#39;s telling you something about its</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.079" end="02:15:51.280" style="s2">commitment to discussing</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.159" end="02:15:52.560" style="s2">things that are important and uh if</p>
<p begin="02:15:51.280" end="02:15:55.360" style="s2">you&#39;re paying attention to</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.560" end="02:15:56.719" style="s2">alternative sources then you know that</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.360" end="02:15:57.520" style="s2">there are certain stories that never</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.719" end="02:15:59.119" style="s2">show up</p>
<p begin="02:15:57.520" end="02:16:00.719" style="s2">in the mainstream media and that that</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.119" end="02:16:03.360" style="s2">has something to do with</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.719" end="02:16:05.679" style="s2">a desire to keep on script rather than</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.360" end="02:16:08.239" style="s2">to admit what&#39;s actually taking place</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.679" end="02:16:08.960" style="s2">and you know if you had somebody in your</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.239" end="02:16:10.800" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.960" end="02:16:12.320" style="s2">that was committed to you not knowing</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.800" end="02:16:14.400" style="s2">important facts about</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.320" end="02:16:16.400" style="s2">things that were going on in and around</p>
<p begin="02:16:14.400" end="02:16:18.079" style="s2">you you would exclude them</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.400" end="02:16:19.679" style="s2">because you would know that they were up</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.079" end="02:16:21.280" style="s2">to no good and</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.679" end="02:16:23.280" style="s2">in this case that&#39;s what we have we have</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.280" end="02:16:24.320" style="s2">a malevolent force and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.280" end="02:16:26.159" style="s2">unpatriotic</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.320" end="02:16:27.520" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t have our well-being at</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.159" end="02:16:30.000" style="s2">heart and</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.520" end="02:16:30.639" style="s2">we have an obligation to confront it so</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.000" end="02:16:34.880" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.639" end="02:16:38.080" style="s2">it&#39;d be great if we could gain access to</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.880" end="02:16:41.359" style="s2">the mainstream media but</p>
<p begin="02:16:38.080" end="02:16:45.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we should expect them to</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.359" end="02:16:47.679" style="s2">let us in and their failure to do so</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.760" end="02:16:49.120" style="s2">is evidence that we have to go around</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.679" end="02:16:50.800" style="s2">and there are plenty of alternative</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.120" end="02:16:52.559" style="s2">places that we can go</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.800" end="02:16:55.359" style="s2">it&#39;s just a question of whether people</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.559" end="02:16:57.519" style="s2">will tune into them</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.359" end="02:16:59.439" style="s2">i&#39;m curious brett when you if i may when</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.519" end="02:17:00.000" style="s2">you talk about mainstream media if if</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.439" end="02:17:03.200" style="s2">you were to</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.000" end="02:17:05.920" style="s2">pick a show or a a</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.200" end="02:17:06.559" style="s2">an outlet or someone to sit down and</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.920" end="02:17:10.319" style="s2">talk with</p>
<p begin="02:17:06.559" end="02:17:13.679" style="s2">who if you had the choice to pick</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.319" end="02:17:16.240" style="s2">who would it be who would you sit down</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.679" end="02:17:18.399" style="s2">from mainstream media and break bread</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.240" end="02:17:22.080" style="s2">with and share</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.399" end="02:17:24.240" style="s2">the story of the articles of unity</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.080" end="02:17:26.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question i mean i&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="02:17:24.240" end="02:17:28.719" style="s2">know i&#39;ve gone on fox and i&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.319" end="02:17:30.639" style="s2">tucker carlson about it um</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.719" end="02:17:32.319" style="s2">you know he is more open to these things</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.639" end="02:17:34.719" style="s2">than anything on the</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.319" end="02:17:36.000" style="s2">the left side but i would say this is</p>
<p begin="02:17:34.719" end="02:17:38.960" style="s2">really up to them</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.000" end="02:17:39.760" style="s2">you know the new york times doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.960" end="02:17:41.280" style="s2">this idea</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.760" end="02:17:43.519" style="s2">why doesn&#39;t it like this idea because it</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.280" end="02:17:44.240" style="s2">has a very clear sense of keeping you</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.519" end="02:17:46.639" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.240" end="02:17:48.240" style="s2">the new york times has gone from being</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.639" end="02:17:51.519" style="s2">the paper of record</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.240" end="02:17:53.760" style="s2">to being uh like a set of blinders</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.519" end="02:17:54.559" style="s2">right that just keeps a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.760" end="02:17:57.120" style="s2">voter from</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.559" end="02:17:59.439" style="s2">seeing things that would disturb them</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.120" end="02:17:59.439" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="02:18:00.000" end="02:18:03.679" style="s2">i i wish i knew the answer to your</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.599" end="02:18:04.160" style="s2">question but but the structure has</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.679" end="02:18:07.599" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.160" end="02:18:08.479" style="s2">so corrupt that uh i&#39;m waiting for</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.599" end="02:18:10.479" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.479" end="02:18:12.080" style="s2">inside of it to break out and make</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.479" end="02:18:14.559" style="s2">contact and say actually</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.080" end="02:18:17.920" style="s2">we see it too i don&#39;t think it is</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.559" end="02:18:17.920" style="s2">necessarily sensible to</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.160" end="02:18:22.559" style="s2">point to particular voices there and</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.880" end="02:18:23.519" style="s2">expect them to respond because they</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.559" end="02:18:26.080" style="s2">won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.519" end="02:18:26.080" style="s2">i hear you</p>

<p begin="02:18:42.479" end="02:18:45.599" style="s2">breakthrough with mainstream media i</p>
<p begin="02:18:44.160" end="02:18:47.679" style="s2">believe that that there are already</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.599" end="02:18:49.519" style="s2">people there i think there are</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.679" end="02:18:52.399" style="s2">there are more people aware of the</p>
<p begin="02:18:49.519" end="02:18:55.439" style="s2">articles of unity than perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.399" end="02:18:58.559" style="s2">we realize and i think the message</p>
<p begin="02:18:55.439" end="02:19:02.000" style="s2">spreads far and wide and propagates</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.559" end="02:19:04.840" style="s2">in ways very difficult to</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.000" end="02:19:07.679" style="s2">to track and keep the metrics of and</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.840" end="02:19:08.319" style="s2">success what is success how do we define</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.679" end="02:19:11.359" style="s2">it</p>
