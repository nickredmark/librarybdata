<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:36.640" style="s2">had an interest</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">in christianity for a long time i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.640" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">raised</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">religious i was raised in a in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">where you know we went to church every</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">sunday and um</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">and then and you know i i</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:53.360" style="s2">i was a believer uh although</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">you know in my teenage years i went</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">through a questioning phase</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">um but then in my early 20s i started</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">reading</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">um books uh of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">biblical scholarship uh and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">got really fascinated with that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">began reading the bible</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">really seriously and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">then i did i decided uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">you know i got a comic book a publisher</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">hired me to do a comic book series and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">could basically do whatever i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">in it and so for part of it i decided</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">i&#39;m super interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">in the subject of the you know religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">christianity the gospels why don&#39;t i do</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">um an adaptation of the of the gospels</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">and so i started with the gospel of mark</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">which was the earliest of the gospels</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">so i was and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">made me focus even more on reading uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">works of biblical scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">and so i this would have been the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">when i was</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">doing this and uh sometime in the 80s i</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">think around</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">87 or 1988 a book was published</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">um by this biblical scholar named jane</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">schaberg</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">the book was titled the illegitimacy of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">jesus</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">and jane schaberg&#39;s uh contention</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">was that uh the virgin mary</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">uh uh had not been</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">versioned that that she had been</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">raped and that jesus was the result of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">that that rape and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">i read that and i was like yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">makes more sense than</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">the story that she was a virgin so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">pretty much just accepted</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">uh jane&#39;s uh proposal</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">and um um</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">and then and uh just</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">uh and and by the way the illegitimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">the illegitimacy of jesus is a great</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">uh even though i now disagree with some</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">of the conclusions in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">uh i i mean if you&#39;re into biblical</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">like everyone should be reading that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">book um but</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">so um so like i said i accepted her</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">and um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">went on with things and then um</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">years later uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">totally unrelated i started uh visiting</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">prostitutes</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">started started paying for sex and um</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">that got me interested in you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">stories about prostitutes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">i was already into the bible so biblical</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">stories about prostitutes</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">and now going back to jane schaberg</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">part of her reason for believing</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">that jesus had been illegitimate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">mary had been raped</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">was this genealogy in the gospel of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">matthew</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">in that genealogy um</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">now biblical genealogies</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">usually just focus on men like uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">uh adam gave birth to seth who gave</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">birth to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">uh micah who gave birth to whatever i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">making up names but uh you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">it&#39;s a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">men so such and such male begat such and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">such male but</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">such and such male and the women are</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">totally ignored like the mothers are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">mentioned usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">in genealogies and matthew&#39;s genealogy</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">is different</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:50.840" style="s2">it mostly focuses on men but</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">five women are mentioned in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:55.919" style="s2">genealogy</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">the five women are uh let&#39;s see if i can</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.919" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">remember them off the top of my head</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">uh tamar rahab ruth</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">bathsheba and mary the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">mary the mother of jesus um</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">and so jane schaberg</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">was like why did matthew</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">do this why did he mention five women</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">and not</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">other women in in that genealogy</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">and this is really strange because women</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">are not usually mentioned in genealogies</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">and she said um she pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">that the the first four women</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">are women who are somehow associated</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">um doing something</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">sexually unconventional um</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">outside of marriage um</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">uh tamar had been uh had had sex for</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">with with a man uh rahab had</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">men um ruth</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">had uh seduced a man in order to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:16.720" style="s2">get him to marry her and bathsheba</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">now bathsheba is the questionable one</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.720" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">the the way that matthew probably would</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">have seen it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">uh is that bathsheba uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">tempted king david into getting sexually</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">involved with her</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">and so that would have been you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">pre-marital sex</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">uh some people make the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">bathsheba</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.840" style="s2">would have been uh could have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">she definitely could have been a rape</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.840" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">victim so that&#39;s the closest to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">jane schaberg&#39;s theory that but anyways</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">jane schaberg was arguing</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">that the inclusion of these four women</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:57.599" style="s2">in the genealogy</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">meant that um</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.599" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">that uh the virgin that mary had been</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">was a rape victim and i had accepted</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">that initially and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">at a certain point i was like no only</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">only one of those women was a potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">rape victim</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">uh the first three were not two of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">having sex for money one of them uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">you know was deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">seduced a man and the fourth one</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">uh bathsheba she might have been a rape</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">victim</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">but it&#39;s more likely that matthew</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">actually the author of the gospel of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">matthew wouldn&#39;t have been named matthew</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to call him matthew just for</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">convenience sake uh matthew</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">probably did not see her as a rape</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">victim he probably saw her as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">temptress</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">so and that&#39;s probably he was probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">the these four women um</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">they&#39;re connected to mary like</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">uh mary got pregnant in a way that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">similar to</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">these four women um so to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">it looked likely that mary uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">had um</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">had probably been a prostitute uh what</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">if if we&#39;re supposed to connect those</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">four women to mary</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.040" style="s2">uh why would two women who uh charge</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">money for sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.040" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">be in that list if prostitution wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">the anyway so uh i concluded that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s what matthew intended us</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">uh to see that that mary was</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">he was matthew was intending to hint</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">that mary was</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">a prostitute um</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looked like to me so um</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to think where when would i</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">have come to that conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">probably the early 2000s or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">and so i was thinking oh i should do a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">book about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">um but i couldn&#39;t think how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">so this idea was in my mind for many</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">years that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">mary was probably a prostitute and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">do i turn that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">into a book and you know i had other</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">books to work on so</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s how it started that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">initial germ of the idea for the book</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know i when i went on a long</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">time there i</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you want to ask yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">i i do have a follow-up question for</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">that i uh i&#39;ll point out here that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">probably take a couple questions maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">back and forth between the two of us but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">uh within the next like 15 minutes here</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">open it up two questions from the chat</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">so i encourage anybody as questions come</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">up to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:59.839" style="s2">type them in the chat this is being</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">recorded so if you would prefer not to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.839" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">appear in the youtube video you can just</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">indicate that you would prefer for me to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">read your question for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">but that being said i&#39;m curious chester</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">one of the things that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">in uh mary wept over the feet of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">matthew let&#39;s call him uh wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">been able to just come right out</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:24.399" style="s2">and say that that mary wasn&#39;t a virgin</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">and i wonder uh what you see as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">in the past and in the present why</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">people would</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">want to present mary as either</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">immaculate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">pure or as wronged rather than having</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">made it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">like some sort of choice with her</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">um yeah i i</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">uh i mean the the the very idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">mary was a virgin um</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think and and this was also</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">another uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">one of the things that um jane schaberg</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">contended was that the idea that mary</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">was a virgin</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">is not a biblical idea she argued that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">it&#39;s nowhere in the bible it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">matthew and it&#39;s not in luke um</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t matthew or luke or</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">or any of the biblical writers who</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">contended that she was a virgin</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">it was the readers of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">matthew and luke early on who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">want to accept</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:32.639" style="s2">the obvious implication of the story</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">that matthew</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.639" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">and luke incidentally luke is</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">is another of the of the gospel uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">i mean there are four gospels four four</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">books in the bible</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">that basically tell the story about</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">jesus matthew mark</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">luke and john and so the the two stories</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">tell the story that tell about um</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">uh the birth of jesus uh that tell the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">story about</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">mary and uh joseph the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">the you know the the two people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">raised jesus</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:14.000" style="s2">um those come from matthew and luke</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">and yeah if you really examine them</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.000" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">neither of them says that mary was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">virgin it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s people early christians</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to accept the implication</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">that mary got</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">pregnant uh by having sex with a man</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">other than joseph the man she eventually</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">married</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">and that she was having that she had at</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">had to have had sex with at least one</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">man outside of wedlock</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">you know prior to marrying joseph uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">the the early christians didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">accept that so they invented this story</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">about the virginity of of mary</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s difficult now for people</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">reading those stories</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">to see that they um</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">read matthew and luke and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">project um</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">that idea onto them project the idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">and i mean there are reasons for that uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">say in luke um</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">the first time i think mary is referred</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">to in the story she is referred to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">as a virgin um but</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">just saying that she&#39;s a virgin when</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">she&#39;s introduced into the story doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">mean she stays a virgin</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">and that she is still a virgin after she</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">becomes pregnant with jesus and actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">if you read luke after she gets pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:42.880" style="s2">she is never</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">again referred to as a virgin so</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.880" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s similar in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">matthew</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">both matthew and luke were trying were</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">coy like they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">they didn&#39;t want to emphasize what was</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">uh you know that mary had sex with some</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">other guy other than joseph</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">but they made it pretty clear that she</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">and um so they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">because they were coy about it because</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">they didn&#39;t want to be too</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">they they were trying to uh indicate</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">that mary</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">had gods that god approved of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">the birth of jesus um without</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">emphasizing too strongly</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">what how mary actually got</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">pregnant like um they wanted to take the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">emphasis off that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t want to it&#39;s now what i</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">think i didn&#39;t actually put this in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">but now what i think is going because i</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">why um</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">why would they admit okay in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">matthew</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.480" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">why would he even want to hint that mary</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">had been a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">a a a prostitute if he was embarrassed</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:05.759" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">why just why include that information in</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.759" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">the genealogy why not</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">um um</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">not deal with it at all maybe even skip</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">the birth of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">or or or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">and so uh if i was writing</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">the the matthew chapter now that i in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">in mary wept over the feet of jesus um</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">i would i would change it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">um the reason why i think they</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">hinted at it was because too many people</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">knew i suspect that what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">okay matthew and luke they weren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">first gospels the very first gospel</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">is the gospel of mark and mark</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no birth of jesus story in there</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:02.839" style="s2">and barely he barely discusses the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">mother of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.839" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">and i think now</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">what what happened is that people were</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">making fun of the early christians they</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">were saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t even admit like you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">you had you wrote this book the gospel</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">of mark and you had to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">the the birth of jesus because you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">embarrassed about</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">his mother and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">forced matthew and luke</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">to at least deal with the the birth just</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">to um to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">admit that there was that that uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">mary had not gotten pregnant uh by</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">having sex with joseph</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">that she got pregnant out of wedlock</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">prior to being with joseph</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">and i think they were kind of forced to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">admit it</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">and but they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">skipped over that information</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">they included the information but but</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">dealt with it in such a way that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">yeah they as i said they were being</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">quiet about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">and uh so now that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">uh was going on that that they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">forced to it by by the critics of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">christianity um and then because</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.559" style="s2">they weren&#39;t explicit because they</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t say exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.559" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">who got married pregnant when and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">and where</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">um uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">then then subsequent christians were</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">read that story as being the story about</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">a miraculous virgin birth</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">um i i think it&#39;s really fascinating how</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">you understand jesus and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">his life in light of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">about his own birth and that it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">like socially frowned upon in some way</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">could you speak a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">um yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">uh um i i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">jesus did uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">i mean there are several hints about</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">this elsewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">early christian writings um in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">gospel of john for instance</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">jesus gets involved in a debate</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">with um some some people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">apparently disagree with him and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">um they&#39;re kind of trading insults back</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">and forth</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">and at one point um</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">these these i think they&#39;re pharisees or</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">jewish scribes or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">they they they say something like</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">uh our mothers were</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">weren&#39;t prostitutes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">prior to this there&#39;d been no discussion</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">about anyone&#39;s mothers or anyone being a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:08.480" style="s2">prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">so why did they bring it up it seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.480" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">be uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">a hint that uh that that jesus</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">had been uh his mother had been a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">so i i uh obviously and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">similar thing in the gospel of uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a similar reference to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">gospel</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">of uh thomas um where</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">it says something about um</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to think uh i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">the exact wording but it refers to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">uh it that jesus was the son of a whore</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">uh so i think jesus drew up</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">uh knowing about his mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">uh background and and knowing that she</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">had been a prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">and i think this resulted in him</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">uh you know there are there&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">um and there are certain indications in</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">there&#39;s uh a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">saying in the gospel of matthew where uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">jesus says you know prostitutes are</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">getting into heaven ahead of you and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">he&#39;s talking to but again i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">pharisees there</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">um or jewish elders um</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">which seems to anyways um</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">so so there&#39;s already this idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">that people have that jesus uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">was tolerant of prostitution and that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">was forgiving of them and i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">think it goes beyond that i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">just had i don&#39;t think he just tolerated</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">them i think there was something</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">else going on and that&#39;s that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">uh another chapter in um</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">mary wept over the feet of jesus um</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">i came across an alternate version</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">parables of jesus the parable of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">um and now</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">in this parable in the biblical version</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">of of the parable it&#39;s a story about a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">rich man who&#39;s going away</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">on a trip and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">um he calls</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">his three most trusted slaves to him</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">and he says i&#39;m going away on this trip</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">but i want you to take care of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">money while i&#39;m gone so um</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.400" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">the the amounts i think it was five</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">talents</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">to my most trusted slave uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">three talents to my second most trusted</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">slave</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">and one talent to uh my third most</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">trusted slave</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">and i want you to take care of the money</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.840" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">for me while i&#39;m away</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">and when i come back</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">and i&#39;ll i&#39;m going to come back sometime</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">a year or two from now and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">uh while he&#39;s away the two most trusted</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">slaves they both invest the money and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">they double the money and the the one</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">less trusted the one who only got one</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">talent he</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">takes that one talent and buries it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">thereby uh keeps it safe and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">so when the master comes back uh the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">the two most trusted slaves are able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">say to the master</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.080" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">we doubled your money and uh so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">master&#39;s happy with them</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">and the slave who buried the money</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">he um the master is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">very unhappy with him and he&#39;s he um</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">says you know get out of my sight and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">this has always</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">puzzled christians because it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">look like jesus</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">is super concerned about money and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:28.240" style="s2">investing money and doubling your money</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">which totally contradicts everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.240" end="00:24:31.760" style="s2">that jesus says</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">you know elsewhere in the gospels where</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.760" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">like don&#39;t be concerned about money like</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">don&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t worry about these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">things um</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">i was i was reading a book uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">i think in 2014 i was reading a book</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">about um the parables of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">and so it was by the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">book was by this biblical or i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">officially a biblical scholar well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">he&#39;s a historian</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">and he&#39;s super interested in the bible</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">uh this guy</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">john dominic crossin um</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">and so uh i believe the book&#39;s title is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">the power of parable uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">or the power of parables something like</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:27.520" style="s2">so in the section of the book where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.520" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">parable of the talent of the talents</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">he mentions and i had never heard this</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">that there&#39;s an alternate version of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">this story which was given by the early</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">church um father historian</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:50.039" style="s2">um eusebius who if i&#39;m remembering</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">correctly i think he lived around</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.039" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">8300 um</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">i hope i don&#39;t have that too wrong or</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">too off but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">um uh so eusebius said</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">the earliest ver in the earliest version</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">of the gospel of matthew</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an alternate version of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">parable of the talents and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">um in that version</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">uh the the rich</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">master is going away and again he</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">in this version he also calls his three</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">most trusted slaves to him</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">and says to you know uh to the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">trusted one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">i&#39;m giving you five talents to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">second most trusted one i&#39;m giving you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:39.919" style="s2">three and to the least trusted one</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">and then he goes away but in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">version of the story</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">um the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">uh the most trusted one well um</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">eusebius&#39;s telling of the story is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">unclear</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">so who he gives the money to and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">who spends the money in which way is</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit muddled uh but one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">the one of the slaves spends all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">money on prostitutes</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">and one of them uh invests the money and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">doubles it</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">and again one of them buries it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">uh you know just ends up uh with</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">just the the the one talent he was given</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">or that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">what the amount that he was given uh and</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">when uh the master comes back</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">he&#39;s very pleased with one of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">slaves</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">he&#39;s not so pleased with a another one</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">and he&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">he apparently again the uh he&#39;s unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">the slave who buried the talent um</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:55.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s unclear was he happy with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">with the with the slave who spent all</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.919" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">the money</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">on prostitutes that&#39;s how i think this</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">there i get into a large</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">uh into a lengthy uh discussion of why i</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">that this is the way that the ma that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">jesus</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">originally told the story that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">master when he comes back</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">he embraces the slave who</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">spent all the money on prostitutes and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">is less happy with the slave who doubled</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">the money and he&#39;s least happy with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:38.480" style="s2">with the slave who buried the the talent</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">um and if i&#39;m right</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">then it indicates that g that jesus</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">um didn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">tolerate prostitution that he</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">actually saw it as socially beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">i think that&#39;s what the parable is is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:29:00.559" style="s2">telling us</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">um and yeah i give</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.559" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">uh i&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">convincing when i&#39;m telling it right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">uh i hope it&#39;s convincing in all my in</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">my lengthy endnotes why i explain why</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">i think the master in the story embraces</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">the the the one who spent the money on</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">prostitutes</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">uh but yeah that&#39;s my main reason for</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">thinking that jesus</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:29.520" style="s2">saw prostitution is socially beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">i so enjoy your adaptation of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">parable of the talents because i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">it really</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">um gets at the exact intersection</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">um prostitution and this sort of broader</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">like reward for some sorts of religious</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">disobedience</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">like the idea that god or jesus aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">actually looking for us to like follow</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">the letter of the law</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:55.760" style="s2">compared to the way that they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">for us to like have faith and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.760" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">and try to have a good life for</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">um i i think that um tyler&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">um would be really interesting to move</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">into from here</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">tyler could you unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">yeah sorry i was washing the dishes</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">i was i was curious chester how your</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">relationship to christianity</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">has changed over time whether you still</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">consider yourself a christian</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">maybe you consider yourself like a sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">of almost alternate christian</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">who has a christian adjacent belief</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">system but that includes things like</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">sacred prostitution uh that set of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">yeah i i i i i</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">when i when i first became obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">reading about all this sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">back in the 80s um</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">i was reading all this biblical</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">scholarship that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s it initially seemed to tear</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:31:01.039" style="s2">apart the gospels</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">and um it made it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.039" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">difficult to continue to believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">that you know the the gospels or the by</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">the material in the bible is the word of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">when you can when you understand how it</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">was all put together and everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">um so that kind of shook my faith uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">for a while and i was um</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">for a while for a year or two</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.960" style="s2">maybe longer than that i was defining</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">myself as an agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.960" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:45.679" style="s2">then i started getting more into</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">what is called uh the gnostic material</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.679" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">um that made more</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">sense to me that the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">um a sense the divine was more</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">uh that you got it more from in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">inside yourself than from relying on</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">outwardly</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">on sets of writings by other people</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">now since then i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:18.159" style="s2">um a biblical scholar named</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">karen king has sort of deconstructed the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.159" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:23.120" style="s2">actually was an ancient group called</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">uh but of course there were</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">writings that that uh that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">that did later get defined or uh as</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">as as gnosticism so i guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s a contentious term but</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">anyways uh basically i&#39;m saying i found</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">a way back</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">into um the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">the religion and um</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:54.960" style="s2">so for a while i i was</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">i was back to considering myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.960" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">religious and believing in god but</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">it&#39;s like i don&#39;t have to define myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">as a christian anymore</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">um eventually i decided</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.120" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">why like i&#39;m obviously obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">this stuff like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">reading about jesus all the time</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">and i believe there&#39;s a god and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">this is my</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:29.279" style="s2">my like my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.840" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">of god comes through</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.279" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">the christian stories the parables</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">the um the story about jesus</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">um the uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">the the the metaphors that are used in</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">the the the rituals it&#39;s uh like</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">this this if i&#39;m so obsessed with it and</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:58.480" style="s2">reasons</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">not not just the idea that in the bible</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">that that&#39;s what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">that jesus was somehow related to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">is the sequence in the bible</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty clear this is in all for the</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">and john all have this scene</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">is important because that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">christ means it means anointed one</p>

<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">and this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">in the gospels this is the only time</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">that jesus</p>

<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty clear certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">the gospel of luke the the woman is</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">referred to as a sinner and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">um it</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">everyone interprets that as the you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">luke meaning that the woman was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to think i think in</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">uh mark</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">mark and matthew they&#39;re not as clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s this woman who who comes</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">but then the significant uh gospel in</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">in regards to this story is the gospel</p>

<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">um because in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">john&#39;s recounting of the story and again</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">john</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">the gospel john was not written by a guy</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">named john i&#39;m going to call him john</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">uh in john&#39;s version of the story</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:36.560" style="s2">um the the woman who annoys jesus</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">is named and her her name is mary of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">bethany</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:44.839" style="s2">and um mary</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">of in in this version of this story</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.839" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">um mary of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">mary um has her hair uncovered</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">she&#39;s not referred to as a prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">but she has her hair uncovered</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">and this is not something women</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">conventionally did</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">at that time in in jewish society at</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">that time women kept their head</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">their hair covered because hair was seen</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">as being</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">erotically alluring like a woman who</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">exposed her hair it would have been the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">equivalent today of a woman</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">of a woman bearing her breasts and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">woman</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:24.640" style="s2">would not have done that in a ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">like this and it&#39;s it&#39;s clear that her</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">hair is exposed</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">as she&#39;s anointing jesus um</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">so it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">seems pretty clear she&#39;s a prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">the prostitutes were the women at that</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">who exposed their hair um</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">and uh so so</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">this dovetails with luke calling her a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">sinner</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">um so uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">yeah it seems pretty clear and so why is</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">jesus being</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">anointed by a prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">um unless this</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">this is um</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">this relates to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">i it&#39;s my impression that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">jesus was involved in a form of judaism</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">that honored not just the male god</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">yahweh but also the female goddess</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">asherah and there are references in</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">ancient texts to</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">yahweh the jewish god having a female</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">consort</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">named asherah actually there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">debate about</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:42.400" style="s2">whether ashrae is actually a name</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">there&#39;s also a debate about whether</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">yahweh is actually a name but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">avoid all that let&#39;s we&#39;re going to call</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">them we&#39;re going to say that their names</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">were yahweh and ashrae</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">so i think jesus was involved</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">organization that had been</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">it had been a part of judaism although</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">not formally acknowledged in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">jewish texts but it had been</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">uh part of judaism for centuries i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">and and i mean it is acknowledged in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">jewish text to the degree that you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:25.680" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">that um uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.680" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">a certain that the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">priests were constantly trying to purge</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">uh goddess worship from judaism</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s there are lots of references</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">um to worshipers of baal</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">being executed and it seems obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">me that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:54.000" style="s2">these this was a part of judaism</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">that this was an internal war of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.000" end="00:41:58.960" style="s2">within judaism</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">and the the faction</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.960" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">that wanted to say that that wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">define</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">uh judaism as a monotheistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:12.480" style="s2">uh a religion ruled over by one male god</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the faction that went out but it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.480" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the only</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">part it wasn&#39;t the only uh faction</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">within judaism</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">that there had been a faction that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">was into goddess worship that honored</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">uh god as having both a male and female</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">aspect is perhaps a better way to say it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">does that answer your question tyler</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">maybe i got off</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">it topic very interesting but not</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">more interested in um chester&#39;s own</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">and like how his parents must have been</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">badass so on some level</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">um and so when i got to that part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">matthew in your book i</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">had a very strong emotional reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">it and i liked it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.319" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">um uh i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve gotten like lots</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">of bad criticism since the book was</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">written like my own mother was like this</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">guy&#39;s out to lunch</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">but uh have you had any like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">already talked about a few but i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">really interested if like any good</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">critical engagement</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.760" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">since then that maybe or uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">more things that have come up um since</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">writing the book like</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">uh uh ideas that maybe people agree with</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">you and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">and uh or disagree with you that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">pushed the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">idea forward a bit more yeah i guess uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">i mean you refer to to um</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">me talking about our earlier uh</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">probably the one that you&#39;re thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">is like i have a very close friend</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">who is a christian</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">and she was um</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.440" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">actually when when the book came out i</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">you know maybe you don&#39;t want to read</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">friendship and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.960" end="00:46:12.640" style="s2">she was like no no no i really want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">read it and of course then she read it</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.640" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">and she was totally offended and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">upset with me and and um</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:25.200" style="s2">but but then she she came around</p>

<p begin="00:46:25.200" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">particularly in the years since then</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:36.240" style="s2">she has gotten involved</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">in really um studying biblical</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.240" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">scholarship and</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">now she understands more uh where where</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">i&#39;m where i was coming from</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">and uh now we&#39;re back to being very good</p>

<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">asking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">if there&#39;s been stuff since then</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">this is relatively an old book by now</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">it came out in 2016 and so in the last</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">like i still i still</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">go go on um which i&#39;ll call it goodreads</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">and keep up with the reviews that one</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">sees there</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">and when the book first came out there</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">were all sorts of people who hated the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">as well as people who really loved the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">book um</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:42.160" style="s2">and uh but</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">that was in the maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.160" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">the first six months or the first year</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">of when the book was</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">released and since then there continued</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:53.680" style="s2">to be people posting reviews</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">and for whatever reason um</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.680" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">now it&#39;s getting almost exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">positive reviews from people on a source</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure why</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">initially it was divided between</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">negative reactions and positive</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">reactions</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">um maybe that&#39;s because of the initial</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">uh publicity around the book and so more</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">uh maybe have a religious nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">uh were encountering</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">hearing the about the book and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">word of mouth readers and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">that that&#39;s maybe kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">self-selection process that results in</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">uh just uh people</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">positively encountering the book but um</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">but yeah i haven&#39;t had a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">negative reaction</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">in the last few years to the book</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">um jacob would you like to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">so chester uh regarding</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">christ&#39;s view of prostitution</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.839" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">uh we not say that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">we can discern his view of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">based on his obvious reference for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">mosaic law so for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">he constantly was upholding the law and</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">referencing it right he would say</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">it is written it is written as written</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">have you not read have you not read how</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">does the law read</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">who&#39;s constantly referring to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">referring to it as his</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">touchstone right source of truth in fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">even when he committed</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">when he performed healings he would say</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">now go show yourself to the priest</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">so he was still encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">adherence to the law even right before</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">he was about to abolish it</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s impossible to read the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:00.400" style="s2">scriptures from the hebrew to the greek</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">without being very clear how christ</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.400" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">feels about the mosaic law the mosaic</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">law says in leviticus</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">uh do not profane your daughter by</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">making her a prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another instance in</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">leviticus where it says something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">if the daughter of a priest profanes</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">herself by prostitution</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">and then some sort of consequence is</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">listed so</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">to me it&#39;s like how could christ</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">uphold prostitution uh at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">the clarity</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">where the law stands clearly on on</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:38.160" style="s2">prostitution</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:41.760" style="s2">um well the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.760" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">did jesus have reverence for the mosaic</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">law now</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">if if one um</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it that seems to be the case if one</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">reads the gospel of matthew</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">matthew is totally f he&#39;s obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">the mosaic law</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">and um it&#39;s a big deal for matthew to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">establish jesus within</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">jewish history and i mean that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:15.280" style="s2">why there&#39;s that genealogy</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">um in matthew um</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.280" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">and and yeah but but</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">did matthew get jesus</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">right um i mean this is a question</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:29.520" style="s2">right from the beginning of the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">gospels</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.520" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">the first gospel was the gospel as i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">said the gospel of mark</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">did mark understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">jesus um</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">mark um</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">there&#39;s an odd thing about mark which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">mark uh presents</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">the story of jesus from the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">jesus&#39;s ministry</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">up until uh jesus&#39;s crucifixion and if</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">you know a few days after that um</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:17.040" style="s2">uh but mark has this</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">uh odd take uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.040" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">not just on jesus but on the disciples</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">mark is continually presenting the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">disciples</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">of jesus as being stupid is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.400" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:36.319" style="s2">jesus&#39;s message um this</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">is this is one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">messages of mark which is the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">the apostles of of jesus didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">understand him</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">um who understands jesus</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">mark understands jesus now mark</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">never never met jesus how likely is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">that mark understood jesus better than</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">the disciples of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">i think jesus i think mark</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">had his particular understanding of who</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">jesus was</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:15.200" style="s2">but his understanding was in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">with the message that the disciples had</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.200" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">the the disciples of jesus were probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:25.920" style="s2">alive uh when jesus oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">when mark was writing his gospel</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.920" end="00:53:32.800" style="s2">and um so</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">mark if he wanted his version of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.800" end="00:53:39.359" style="s2">to be under uh to be accepted</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">had to downplay the the disciples of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.359" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">jesus</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">had to say these guys did not understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">jesus they were stupid they were idiots</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">um and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">that so that&#39;s uh so i&#39;m i i really</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">mark is conveying the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">genuine teachings of jesus uh i i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.040" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">there&#39;s probably some genuine teachings</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">of jesus mixed in there</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">but uh i think he&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">uh you know presenting some</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">probably some stuff he&#39;s getting from</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">paul</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">who also never met jesus and uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">some stuff maybe he get he got from</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">other sources</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">but um he&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">saying stuff that the disciples of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">weren&#39;t saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">like he&#39;s contradicting the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">disciples of jesus now</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">matthew who is the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">gospel writer who really stresses</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">jesus&#39;s reverence</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">for the mosaic law matthew&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">gospel is a rewritten version of mark&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">gospel</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">matthew&#39;s gospel is um</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a step removed it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">even one more step removed from jesus</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:07.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s based on a source that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">unlikely to be faithful to the teachings</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.599" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">basically that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying so how</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">how much reverence did jesus really have</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">for the mosaic law</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t i suspect he he did respect it</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">and and did see the mosaic law as as uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">doing as as being uh an important part</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">of jewish tradition um there is</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">what was it he he&#39;s talking about uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">divorce law</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">and he said he he talks about um</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">how uh moses uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">gave in to your desire for uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">for the divorce which is an indication</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">that he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">that um the mosaic law</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">was was not necessarily divinely</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">inspired that</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">moses was inventing at least aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">the mosaic law</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">but anyways that that&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">probably disagree which is fine we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">have to agree on everything well</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">it just seems like your answer is just</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:15.760" style="s2">simply well the record&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:17.359" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s way too easy way too</p>
