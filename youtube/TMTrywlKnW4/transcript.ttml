<p begin="00:00:05.569" end="00:00:11.580" style="s2">so close been quite a journey over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:15.509" style="s2">last four years or so have you been</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">surprised at the success of Colette yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.509" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">and no I mean we&#39;ve worked very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">get where we are today and so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:28.050" style="s2">of the situation where the public sees</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.830" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">the tip of the iceberg and the iceberg</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.050" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">is all of the hard work and the stress</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">and the problem-solving that has had to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:42.989" style="s2">go on behind the scenes and we were not</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:45.770" style="s2">successful for a long time we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.989" end="00:00:49.140" style="s2">plugging away doing our thing publishing</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.770" end="00:00:51.539" style="s2">what we thought were great articles for</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.140" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">a long time before many people knew who</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.539" end="00:00:59.250" style="s2">we were so it hasn&#39;t been an overnight</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">success if that makes sense it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.250" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">work in progress as you said it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">been an overnight success what do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">think are the key things that have made</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">quill out the success that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">just the hard work you&#39;ve done amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">work behind the scenes but what do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">think is is a reflection of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:23.600" style="s2">that has that has enabled Colette to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">kind of have the resonance that it has I</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.600" end="00:01:31.610" style="s2">suppose a few cultural events really</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">came to the fore one was James d&#39;amours</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.610" end="00:01:38.540" style="s2">sacking from Google that was our first</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:43.100" style="s2">real breakthrough article because we</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.540" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">asked for scientists to comment on his</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.100" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">arguments and to comment on their</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:49.159" style="s2">scientific validity and the for</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">scientists who we spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.159" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">all said that his arguments were quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">reasonable and within the bounds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">normal scientific discourse and when we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:04.020" style="s2">published that that was the only piece</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">out of all of the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.020" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">coverage of the issue which actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:14.030" style="s2">looked at the science and took a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:14.030" style="s2">measured approach and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:18.760" style="s2">popularity increased substantially after</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.410" end="00:02:21.130" style="s2">that and then there&#39;s been a few other</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.760" end="00:02:23.410" style="s2">cultural episodes that we&#39;ve responded</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.130" end="00:02:25.780" style="s2">to and and then there we&#39;ve also just</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.410" end="00:02:32.080" style="s2">benefited from a general Network effect</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.780" end="00:02:36.280" style="s2">where we publish dissident academics so</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.080" end="00:02:38.890" style="s2">academics whose field of work rubs</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.280" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">against the more mainstream narratives</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.890" end="00:02:44.709" style="s2">either within their field or within the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:47.170" style="s2">general culture and so once we publish a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.709" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">renegade academic his or her friends</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.170" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">will read that work and they&#39;ll think oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:54.010" style="s2">I want to go and publish with them</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:55.989" style="s2">because they&#39;re a friendly space for</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.010" end="00:02:58.330" style="s2">people with dissenting views so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.989" end="00:03:02.500" style="s2">benefit benefited from that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.330" end="00:03:04.150" style="s2">network effect I can remember the Google</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.500" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">memo and there was an article in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.150" end="00:03:11.140" style="s2">Atlantic I think by Connor Frias Dorf</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">saying that he couldn&#39;t remember how so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.140" end="00:03:16.840" style="s2">many journalists had mischaracterized a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:20.019" style="s2">document that was freely available to so</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.840" end="00:03:22.630" style="s2">many people yes and that&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.019" end="00:03:25.420" style="s2">example in and there are other examples</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.630" end="00:03:27.850" style="s2">too for just think of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.420" end="00:03:30.790" style="s2">mainstream coverage of Jordan Peterson a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.850" end="00:03:34.510" style="s2">lot of there&#39;s a lot of extreme rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.790" end="00:03:36.940" style="s2">you know he&#39;s such a nurse he&#39;s this and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.510" end="00:03:40.090" style="s2">that when all of his content is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.940" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">available to anyone who has an internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.090" end="00:03:48.430" style="s2">connection so I think what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:51.810" style="s2">mainstream media present a caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.430" end="00:03:54.430" style="s2">an individual or Ihnen or an event and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.810" end="00:03:56.530" style="s2">regular people in their own homes can</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.430" end="00:03:58.900" style="s2">just connect to the internet look it up</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.530" end="00:04:01.090" style="s2">themselves and make their own form their</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.900" end="00:04:05.170" style="s2">own views and their own opinion and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.090" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">disconnect that they see between the raw</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.170" end="00:04:10.209" style="s2">materials or the primary source and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">interpretation offered by the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.209" end="00:04:16.930" style="s2">media creates this cognitive dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:19.780" style="s2">and that that dissonance is something</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.930" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">we&#39;ve been it benefited from because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.780" end="00:04:26.770" style="s2">view ourselves as being a media platform</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:30.910" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t engage in these</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.770" end="00:04:33.460" style="s2">flagrant misrepresentations and what do</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.910" end="00:04:38.410" style="s2">you think is the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.460" end="00:04:40.270" style="s2">corruption of the mainstream media well</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.410" end="00:04:44.229" style="s2">I think there&#39;s definitely more than one</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.270" end="00:04:48.280" style="s2">variable at play but from my</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.229" end="00:04:51.729" style="s2">observations a lot of journalists live</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.280" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">in a bubble in the United States so they</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.729" end="00:04:57.340" style="s2">might be located in a couple of urban</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:03.370" style="s2">centers maybe in New York or San</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.340" end="00:05:05.710" style="s2">Francisco they have their social circles</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.370" end="00:05:09.970" style="s2">are collapsed into their professional</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.710" end="00:05:13.690" style="s2">circles they&#39;re all on Twitter so</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.970" end="00:05:17.169" style="s2">they&#39;re immersed in this social</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.690" end="00:05:19.210" style="s2">professional milieu where they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.169" end="00:05:21.849" style="s2">trying to impress each other and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.210" end="00:05:24.789" style="s2">feedback loop just becomes very tight</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.849" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard for reality to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.789" end="00:05:30.250" style="s2">penetrate that bubble Qualis has now</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:33.370" style="s2">been called the in-house magazine of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.250" end="00:05:35.860" style="s2">intellectual dark web what does the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.370" end="00:05:41.470" style="s2">intellectual dark web as a concept mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.860" end="00:05:44.979" style="s2">to you well it&#39;s a broad term but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.470" end="00:05:47.349" style="s2">think it would apply to anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.979" end="00:05:50.349" style="s2">trying to understand the current moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.349" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">but is simultaneously questioning</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.349" end="00:05:55.570" style="s2">dominant narratives that are most</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:59.229" style="s2">frequently offered about the current</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.570" end="00:06:03.250" style="s2">moment something that Colette has done</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.229" end="00:06:06.820" style="s2">from its inception is question blank</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.250" end="00:06:08.889" style="s2">slate narratives so blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.820" end="00:06:13.349" style="s2">narratives about human nature so this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.889" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">the idea that we&#39;re born as blank slates</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.349" end="00:06:21.340" style="s2">everything we do or every sociological</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:25.150" style="s2">outcome is determined by culture and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.340" end="00:06:27.509" style="s2">we we&#39;ve challenged that narrative by</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.150" end="00:06:31.289" style="s2">looking at things that like biology</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.509" end="00:06:35.340" style="s2">evolutionary psychology economic factors</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.289" end="00:06:38.590" style="s2">other than this cultural deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.340" end="00:06:40.330" style="s2">model so if you look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.590" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">the gender pay gap through the cult</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.330" end="00:06:45.490" style="s2">for deterministic model women earn less</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.740" style="s2">than men because they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.490" end="00:06:52.689" style="s2">discriminated against but if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.740" end="00:06:55.740" style="s2">it through a a model that takes into</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.689" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">account biology psychology and economics</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.740" end="00:07:01.770" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that there are a range of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:04.629" style="s2">different variables and women are often</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.770" end="00:07:06.610" style="s2">choosing other priorities in life they</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.629" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">might have different preferences for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.610" end="00:07:13.169" style="s2">jobs that they undertake they might</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:15.909" style="s2">prioritize intrinsic motivations over</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.169" end="00:07:17.560" style="s2">extrinsic motivations such as money so</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.909" end="00:07:20.409" style="s2">there are a range of other things going</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.560" end="00:07:22.930" style="s2">on the story is much more complex than</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.409" end="00:07:26.490" style="s2">simply one of discrimination so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.930" end="00:07:30.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried to challenge this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.490" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">deterministic model that is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.550" end="00:07:36.159" style="s2">dominant within mainstream media and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.550" end="00:07:38.379" style="s2">have you been surprised at all at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.159" end="00:07:41.139" style="s2">way that quill ette has been framed in</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.379" end="00:07:45.819" style="s2">some circles as kind of outriders for</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.139" end="00:07:48.310" style="s2">the OLT right and stuff like that not</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.819" end="00:07:50.500" style="s2">really I think the people who frame us</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.310" end="00:07:55.740" style="s2">in that way generally don&#39;t read our</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.500" end="00:08:00.279" style="s2">articles and that kind of simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.740" end="00:08:03.219" style="s2">framing is just immediately refuted by</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.279" end="00:08:05.469" style="s2">reading any of our most popular articles</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.219" end="00:08:11.560" style="s2">that articles are sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.469" end="00:08:13.930" style="s2">nuanced we don&#39;t present simple binary</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:45.510" style="s2">I&#39;d probably be on the left because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.630" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">support things like the minimum wage</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.330" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">been picked and so it&#39;s context-specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.710" end="00:09:11.330" style="s2">the thing that puts me up against the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:13.450" style="s2">left is I reject identity politics and I</p>

<p begin="00:09:13.450" end="00:09:21.260" style="s2">I am a critic of feminism mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.260" end="00:09:25.250" style="s2">feminism I&#39;m a critic of things like</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.250" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">discourse and that kind of thing so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.230" end="00:09:30.980" style="s2">that&#39;s what puts me up against the left</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:34.300" style="s2">but on a lot of other issues I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.980" end="00:09:38.390" style="s2">sympathetic with the leftist worldview</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.300" end="00:09:42.860" style="s2">and what topics for Colette bring the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.390" end="00:09:47.570" style="s2">most kind of heat from critics I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.860" end="00:09:52.790" style="s2">anything that we publish on explaining</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.570" end="00:09:57.320" style="s2">gaps in society with so anything on race</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.790" end="00:10:00.770" style="s2">would be one any any topic covering any</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.320" end="00:10:03.580" style="s2">article topic covering race which is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.770" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">hot-button issue but then there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.580" end="00:10:10.130" style="s2">surprising topics like parenting is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:12.620" style="s2">controversial topic people have very</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.130" end="00:10:14.990" style="s2">different views on parenting styles we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.620" end="00:10:16.990" style="s2">published an article on spanking which</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.990" end="00:10:19.520" style="s2">was very controversial lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.990" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">arguing that spanking is child abuse</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.520" end="00:10:24.260" style="s2">lots of people arguing that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:26.990" style="s2">it&#39;s reasonable in some situations so</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.260" end="00:10:30.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it can be unpredictable what is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.990" end="00:10:33.980" style="s2">most controversial topic you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.710" end="00:10:36.170" style="s2">race obviously Coleman Hughes has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.980" end="00:10:38.450" style="s2">sort of one of your star colonists what</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.170" end="00:10:42.860" style="s2">do you make of the reaction to his</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.450" end="00:10:44.510" style="s2">articles well I think his critics don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.860" end="00:10:47.660" style="s2">know what to do with him because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.510" end="00:10:49.730" style="s2">come out of nowhere he&#39;s very young he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.660" end="00:10:52.820" style="s2">extremely talented and he presents his</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.730" end="00:10:56.690" style="s2">arguments in a very reasonable and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.820" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">measured manner and I think he&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.690" end="00:11:03.260" style="s2">critics so far haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:06.830" style="s2">deconstruct his arguments or dismantle</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.260" end="00:11:11.269" style="s2">his arguments and they&#39;ve attacked him</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.830" end="00:11:12.529" style="s2">on criteria that is irrelevant such as</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.269" end="00:11:16.760" style="s2">the fact that he&#39;s an undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.529" end="00:11:19.480" style="s2">student or that he hasn&#39;t cited their</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.760" end="00:11:25.899" style="s2">favorite scholar in critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.480" end="00:11:28.100" style="s2">so but but he&#39;s he&#39;s received a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.899" end="00:11:31.550" style="s2">positive attention as well as criticism</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.100" end="00:11:33.019" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s good to see because I</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.550" end="00:11:36.920" style="s2">guess there&#39;s a paradox of someone like</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.019" end="00:11:39.350" style="s2">Coleman because he he has had a huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.920" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">amount of success with you can argue</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.350" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">that a lot of these perspectives are not</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:45.740" style="s2">getting a lot of play in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:47.660" style="s2">media but then someone like Coleman</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.740" end="00:11:50.620" style="s2">Hughes comes along and he&#39;s immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.660" end="00:11:53.450" style="s2">swept up by an alternative network of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.620" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">media organizations and there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.450" end="00:11:57.529" style="s2">of is there a paradox there that we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:00.050" style="s2">say oh well these views are being shut</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.529" end="00:12:01.660" style="s2">out but then someone like him has become</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.050" end="00:12:04.040" style="s2">hugely successful at a very young age</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.660" end="00:12:07.250" style="s2">for this perspective he&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.040" end="00:12:12.649" style="s2">why do you think these perspectives are</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.250" end="00:12:14.329" style="s2">necessarily being shut out but from my</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.649" end="00:12:18.260" style="s2">point of view I see a lot of low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.329" end="00:12:20.149" style="s2">fruit so there&#39;s a lot of perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.260" end="00:12:24.170" style="s2">that aren&#39;t being explored simply</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.149" end="00:12:28.220" style="s2">because those who are populating a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.170" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">of the elite media institutions aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.220" end="00:12:35.140" style="s2">covering them so I mean for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:37.550" style="s2">there are only so many ways to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.140" end="00:12:41.690" style="s2">sociological phenomenon through the lens</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.550" end="00:12:43.459" style="s2">of race and gender and if someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.690" end="00:12:45.589" style="s2">in and has a different analytical</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.459" end="00:12:48.890" style="s2">framework then they&#39;re just offering</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.589" end="00:12:50.540" style="s2">something fresh and interesting and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.890" end="00:12:52.640" style="s2">problem that I see is that these elite</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.540" end="00:12:54.140" style="s2">institutions are populated by people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.640" end="00:12:56.540" style="s2">all think the same and who have been</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.140" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">educated at the same schools and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.540" end="00:13:02.300" style="s2">a lack of originality more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.140" end="00:13:08.740" style="s2">has any of the criticism been personally</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.300" end="00:13:11.870" style="s2">hurtful to me to you no I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.740" end="00:13:15.860" style="s2">no I would you say you&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.870" end="00:13:19.190" style="s2">thick-skinned yeah I view criticism as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.860" end="00:13:20.060" style="s2">positive thing I would be much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.190" end="00:13:22.820" style="s2">concerned if our</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.060" end="00:13:24.290" style="s2">wasn&#39;t receiving any criticism and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.820" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">know that you have quite a lot of your</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.290" end="00:13:30.110" style="s2">audience based in the US yes as as do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:33.290" style="s2">I mean we cover some similar topic some</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.110" end="00:13:35.630" style="s2">rebel wisdom we&#39;ve had people like Brett</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.290" end="00:13:39.640" style="s2">Weinstein Eric Weinstein Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.630" end="00:13:41.930" style="s2">on the channel and so it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.640" end="00:13:43.820" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting because we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.930" end="00:13:45.890" style="s2">based outside the US but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.820" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">exposed to the u.s. conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.890" end="00:13:52.280" style="s2">quite a major way how do you avoid I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">mean I guess we&#39;re both aware of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.280" end="00:13:56.780" style="s2">how toxic the conversation can become in</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:13:59.660" style="s2">the US but with a sort of slight</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.780" end="00:14:01.430" style="s2">distance to it as well do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.660" end="00:14:04.610" style="s2">distance is really important to what</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.430" end="00:14:07.400" style="s2">you&#39;re doing with qualit I think so and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.610" end="00:14:09.800" style="s2">and the distance allows one to have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.400" end="00:14:13.490" style="s2">meta perspective so a bigger picture of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.800" end="00:14:15.860" style="s2">you I think one of the problems in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.490" end="00:14:20.930" style="s2">u.s. at the moment is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:22.820" style="s2">focusing on the the small partisan</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.930" end="00:14:25.460" style="s2">issues that occur from day to day</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.820" end="00:14:27.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of noise and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.460" end="00:14:31.160" style="s2">get the signal but if you step back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.830" end="00:14:34.040" style="s2">take a bigger picture of you and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.160" end="00:14:36.110" style="s2">look at the cultural trends rather than</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.040" end="00:14:39.260" style="s2">the little events that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.110" end="00:14:43.000" style="s2">every day you can see larger patterns</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.260" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">more important patterns and so on</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.000" end="00:14:48.590" style="s2">Colette we I mean we do sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.410" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">respond to current events but we try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.590" end="00:14:57.380" style="s2">take a bigger picture of you and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:14:59.210" style="s2">I think it&#39;s been successful because</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.380" end="00:15:00.890" style="s2">there are a lot of people around the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.210" end="00:15:03.050" style="s2">world that that like that approach</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.890" end="00:15:07.580" style="s2">and they&#39;re not interested in just the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.050" end="00:15:10.400" style="s2">the the partisan squabbles that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.580" end="00:15:13.150" style="s2">happening day in and day out and how do</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.400" end="00:15:17.150" style="s2">you cover these kind of topics without</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.150" end="00:15:21.050" style="s2">getting dragged into sort of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.150" end="00:15:25.030" style="s2">war of the u.s. well I think where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.050" end="00:15:28.460" style="s2">are a part of the culture war in the US</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.030" end="00:15:31.460" style="s2">but we&#39;re not part of the partisan</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.460" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">political war in terms of partisan</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.460" end="00:15:36.960" style="s2">politics in the u.s. we are non part</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:39.980" style="s2">even the intellectual dark web was was</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.960" end="00:15:43.170" style="s2">framed as a space for conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.980" end="00:15:45.620" style="s2">it seems that the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.170" end="00:15:47.520" style="s2">conversation in the in the u.s. is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.620" end="00:15:50.670" style="s2">everything seems to become polarized</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.520" end="00:15:54.120" style="s2">almost immediately so even this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.670" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">a space beyond the polarization then</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.120" end="00:15:58.470" style="s2">becomes a polarizing thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:00.390" style="s2">even the attempt to carve out a space</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.470" end="00:16:04.140" style="s2">beyond the culture war becomes part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.390" end="00:16:07.080" style="s2">the culture war I think that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.140" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">what one has to understand about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.080" end="00:16:13.050" style="s2">United States right now is because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:16.710" style="s2">are a very polarized society there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.050" end="00:16:21.000" style="s2">a lot of trust and so it&#39;s difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.710" end="00:16:25.650" style="s2">people to have conversations in good</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.000" end="00:16:29.060" style="s2">faith people are on edge because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.650" end="00:16:31.560" style="s2">feel like what they say might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.060" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">cherry-picked or misinterpreted and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.560" end="00:16:37.950" style="s2">people are searching for secret signs</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:42.360" style="s2">that they&#39;re a secret supporter of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.950" end="00:16:44.550" style="s2">or a secret white nationalist and so it</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.360" end="00:16:47.220" style="s2">inhibits people a great deal I think the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.550" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">benefit of being an outsider is that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.220" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">have less inhibition and from my point</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:58.200" style="s2">of view being an Australian I still live</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">in a society that is not so polarized</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.200" end="00:17:03.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a high trust Society so I know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:08.790" style="s2">when I go and talk to friends they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.750" end="00:17:11.670" style="s2">not trying to find me out as a secret</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.790" end="00:17:14.130" style="s2">supporter of such-and-such cause I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.670" end="00:17:16.980" style="s2">say what I genuinely think without being</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.130" end="00:17:21.770" style="s2">afraid and I think if we bring bringing</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.980" end="00:17:25.550" style="s2">that in lack of inhibition and that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.770" end="00:17:28.440" style="s2">earnestness to conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.550" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">beneficial and even though people will</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:40.530" style="s2">right-wing or whatever that doesn&#39;t mean</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.620" end="00:17:47.220" style="s2">America for I think you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:48.659" style="s2">you appeared on the de Bourbon show and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.220" end="00:17:51.899" style="s2">a couple of other media media</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.659" end="00:17:55.340" style="s2">appearances quite recently what really</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.899" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">struck you about the American</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.340" end="00:17:59.750" style="s2">conversation while you were there or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:04.139" style="s2">American culture while you were there</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.750" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">people get really emotional talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.139" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">about politics if any political topic</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:14.669" style="s2">enters the conversation you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:17.759" style="s2">people&#39;s blood pressure rising you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.669" end="00:18:20.279" style="s2">get really emotional like either doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.759" end="00:18:24.929" style="s2">matter which political persuasion they</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.279" end="00:18:27.450" style="s2">are part of but I noticed that it this</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.929" end="00:18:32.009" style="s2">there&#39;s such a heightened level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.450" end="00:18:34.139" style="s2">feeling and I feel I feel sorry for my</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.009" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">American friends because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.139" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">really difficult to have meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:45.299" style="s2">conversations in those conditions yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">think my my perspective I guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.299" end="00:18:50.820" style="s2">a similarity with between the UK and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:54.029" style="s2">Australia and some differences but there</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.820" end="00:18:58.100" style="s2">does seem to be perhaps because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.029" end="00:19:01.019" style="s2">had the BBC for many years as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.100" end="00:19:02.730" style="s2">respected voice in the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.019" end="00:19:04.649" style="s2">media environment is very different from</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.730" end="00:19:08.370" style="s2">the u.s. it just feels like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.649" end="00:19:12.029" style="s2">there is more of a sense of a civil</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.370" end="00:19:14.100" style="s2">space beyond the polarization in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.029" end="00:19:16.169" style="s2">and maybe in Australia as well whereas</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.100" end="00:19:18.950" style="s2">in the u.s. there doesn&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.169" end="00:19:21.629" style="s2">seem to be any spaces for people to meet</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.950" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">that are not polar that are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.629" end="00:19:26.820" style="s2">immediately seen as being on one side or</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:29.309" style="s2">the other there&#39;s almost no middle</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.820" end="00:19:32.220" style="s2">ground left I think that&#39;s true and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.309" end="00:19:35.309" style="s2">think it&#39;s very unfortunate and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.220" end="00:19:38.250" style="s2">Australia we have the ABC which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.309" end="00:19:40.019" style="s2">sometimes considered to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.250" end="00:19:43.909" style="s2">left-wing but it really isn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.019" end="00:19:46.470" style="s2">really quite a balanced organisation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.909" end="00:19:49.379" style="s2">they do a pretty good job of presenting</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.470" end="00:19:54.419" style="s2">diverse views and and so things are a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.379" end="00:19:56.850" style="s2">lot calmer and more relaxed here and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.419" end="00:19:58.690" style="s2">we&#39;re very lucky to have so far escaped</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.850" end="00:20:05.010" style="s2">the polarization that has</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">that is afflicting the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.010" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">something I&#39;ve been very conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:13.090" style="s2">since starting rebel wisdom especially</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:16.150" style="s2">on YouTube where YouTube is is a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.090" end="00:20:17.320" style="s2">different culture to probably many other</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.150" end="00:20:22.150" style="s2">places on the internet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.320" end="00:20:24.490" style="s2">definitely a much more I&#39;d say a more</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.150" end="00:20:28.860" style="s2">right-wing bias probably on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.490" end="00:20:31.990" style="s2">generally yeah and is is the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.860" end="00:20:33.790" style="s2">phenomenon of audience capture there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.990" end="00:20:36.490" style="s2">this kind of idea out there that if</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.790" end="00:20:38.200" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re self-reliant if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.490" end="00:20:39.310" style="s2">finding yourself through patreon or</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.200" end="00:20:43.180" style="s2">through some other kind of crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.310" end="00:20:45.220" style="s2">site then you&#39;re immune from the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.180" end="00:20:47.740" style="s2">biases of the mainstream media but my</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.220" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">experience is that it can bring in</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.740" end="00:20:53.620" style="s2">another form of bias because you learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:55.150" style="s2">what your audience wants and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.620" end="00:20:57.790" style="s2">the time especially on YouTube what they</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.150" end="00:21:02.590" style="s2">want is stuff that is attacking the left</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.790" end="00:21:04.570" style="s2">or is is is anti the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.590" end="00:21:05.650" style="s2">because they feel that the so many</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.570" end="00:21:08.710" style="s2">perspectives are not being represented</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.650" end="00:21:11.650" style="s2">in the mainstream media yeah how do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.710" end="00:21:13.720" style="s2">feel that sense of or do you feel the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.650" end="00:21:16.770" style="s2">danger of audience capturing what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.720" end="00:21:20.530" style="s2">doing and if so what do you do about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.770" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">that&#39;s an important point I think one</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.530" end="00:21:31.330" style="s2">thing that we&#39;ve done at Collette is</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:34.470" style="s2">focus on our guiding principles so we we</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.330" end="00:21:38.740" style="s2">have a very clear mission to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.470" end="00:21:44.890" style="s2">free thought so whatever kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.740" end="00:21:47.290" style="s2">authoritarian influence is imposing</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.890" end="00:21:49.540" style="s2">itself on freethought we will try and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.290" end="00:21:53.580" style="s2">defend free thinkers and free thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.540" end="00:21:53.580" style="s2">from that so if there&#39;s an authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.090" end="00:21:58.870" style="s2">if there&#39;s a thorough Aryan ideology and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.800" end="00:22:01.750" style="s2">universities for example we will push</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.870" end="00:22:07.300" style="s2">back against that however if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.750" end="00:22:09.040" style="s2">some kind of authoritarian movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.300" end="00:22:12.010" style="s2">coming from the right then we will push</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.040" end="00:22:12.410" style="s2">back against that so we aren&#39;t oriented</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.010" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">ours</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.410" end="00:22:18.049" style="s2">around protecting something quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:20.059" style="s2">specific and easily definable and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.049" end="00:22:22.220" style="s2">is free thought free thinkers people</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.059" end="00:22:25.539" style="s2">wanting to explore empirical questions</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.220" end="00:22:28.660" style="s2">without having their lives destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.539" end="00:22:32.450" style="s2">people coming up with original ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.660" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">so that gives us the freedom and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.450" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">responsibility to be relatively</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:42.620" style="s2">independent and we do I mean we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:45.289" style="s2">aware of what our audience likes but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.620" end="00:22:47.299" style="s2">also have to know our audience so our</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.289" end="00:22:48.980" style="s2">audience will become bored if we present</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.299" end="00:22:51.770" style="s2">the same arguments over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.980" end="00:22:55.460" style="s2">so we need diversity we need a variety</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.770" end="00:22:57.820" style="s2">and we seek that out as much as we can I</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.460" end="00:23:02.210" style="s2">mean one of the big questions in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.820" end="00:23:06.289" style="s2">space is where the boundaries are and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.210" end="00:23:08.659" style="s2">how where the gatekeeping comes in I</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.289" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">think Barry Weiss wrote the article for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.659" end="00:23:14.059" style="s2">the New York Times and that was her</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:17.090" style="s2">conclusion was okay it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.059" end="00:23:19.490" style="s2">great or it&#39;s a positive thing to have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.090" end="00:23:21.850" style="s2">space for heterodox opinions of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.490" end="00:23:25.220" style="s2">intellectual dark web but how do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.850" end="00:23:28.970" style="s2">where are the boundaries where and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.220" end="00:23:33.070" style="s2">do you draw those boundaries yeah so on</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.970" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">Colette we draw a boundary around ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.070" end="00:23:41.570" style="s2">so we we generally have the view that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:43.640" style="s2">empirical question all empirical</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.570" end="00:23:50.710" style="s2">questions or scientific questions are</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.640" end="00:23:50.710" style="s2">legitimate however we don&#39;t publish</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.980" end="00:23:56.860" style="s2">arguments that are not well-formed we</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.240" end="00:24:02.900" style="s2">don&#39;t publish overly emotional</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.860" end="00:24:04.580" style="s2">histrionic diatribes that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.900" end="00:24:07.850" style="s2">written by people who are angry or upset</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.580" end="00:24:14.150" style="s2">or just bitter so we try and filter out</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.850" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">a lot of the the the pieces written when</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.150" end="00:24:19.130" style="s2">people are in a hot and motional state</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:21.080" style="s2">and we look for the the arguments that</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.110" end="00:29:34.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve certainly faced larger problems as</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.560" end="00:29:39.280" style="s2">successfully so on the one hand I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.810" end="00:29:41.470" style="s2">pessimistic on the other hand I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.410" end="00:29:51.340" style="s2">the conversation is so much more toxic</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.140" end="00:29:54.400" style="s2">in America compared to elsewhere in the</p>
