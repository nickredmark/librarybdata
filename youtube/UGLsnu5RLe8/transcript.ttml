<p begin="00:00:05.120" end="00:00:15.519" style="s2">Good. Welcome to &quot;Psychology 230.&quot; Thank you for being here. What I&#39;ll do today</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.519" end="00:00:19.900" style="s2"> I&#39;m going to start by giving you an overview of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.900" end="00:00:25.140" style="s2"> the content of the lecture. Then I will give you an overview of the requirements</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.140" end="00:00:29.210" style="s2"> at the end. But let&#39;s just start with the content right away.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.210" end="00:00:30.050" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:30.050" end="00:00:37.250" style="s2"> There is a website, I don&#39;t like &quot;blackboard,&quot; so I have my own website.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.250" end="00:00:45.320" style="s2"> You can go to jordanbpeterson.com, and there you will find a menu that lists all courses</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.320" end="00:00:50.699" style="s2"> and displays the full study guide. So all the information you will need</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.699" end="00:00:55.059" style="s2"> about the lecture you can find there, including most of the reading material.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.059" end="00:01:02.409" style="s2"> But there is also a book, I assume the majority of you have already purchased it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.409" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2"> It also lists the other things you need to know, such as which days the tests will take place,</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:14.500" style="s2"> what the assignments are, but I&#39;ll cover that at the end of the lesson.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.500" end="00:01:18.160" style="s2"> To begin with, I will tell you what the college is about so you can decide</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.160" end="00:01:24.280" style="s2"> whether that is something for you or not.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.280" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2"> Personality theory is a peculiar domain within psychology because it has a number</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:45.970" style="s2"> includes sub-disciplines that are not particularly well matched.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.970" end="00:01:56.500" style="s2"> For example, it includes clinical psychology and experimental psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.500" end="00:02:06.670" style="s2"> It also includes an approach that is fundamentally individual, and an approach that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.670" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2"> analyzes individual traits in large groups, which is what you usually have to do in experimental psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:22.299" style="s2"> It&#39;s also a strange hybrid of philosophy,</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.299" end="00:02:30.159" style="s2"> architecture, medicine and science. You could think of medicine as a science</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.159" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2"> but it is not, because it is about promoting health,</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:40.659" style="s2"> and health is not a scientific category. It is a necessary category</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.659" end="00:02:47.129" style="s2"> determined by values. For you have to decide what constitutes health and what constitutes disease.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.129" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2"> Or what constitutes well-being, and what constitutes pathology. And you can&#39;t possibly do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:53.689" style="s2"> without making value judgments.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.689" end="00:02:59.090" style="s2"> That&#39;s especially true of psychology, because when you think about what&#39;s healthy</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.090" end="00:03:04.469" style="s2"> personality, you usually don&#39;t just think about the absence of pathology.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.469" end="00:03:09.549" style="s2"> You think about the presence of positive characteristics. Someone who is completely healthy,</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.549" end="00:03:14.409" style="s2"> Mentally and physically. The psychologists, especially the humanistic psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.409" end="00:03:19.219" style="s2"> from the 1960s, see a person as truly mentally healthy when he has realized himself.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.219" end="00:03:23.430" style="s2"> That means he is full</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:32.450" style="s2"> has developed positive potential, whatever that may be. Because of these idiosyncrasies, personality theory,</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.450" end="00:03:38.269" style="s2"> a lecture on personality theory should cover a great deal.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.269" end="00:03:47.060" style="s2"> So this college is very broad. Elements of cultural history are discussed,</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.060" end="00:03:55.029" style="s2"> elements of moral philosophy, and elements that, in my opinion, are almost entirely biological.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.029" end="00:04:01.019" style="s2"> That way, it gives you a multidimensional view of what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.019" end="00:04:02.219" style="s2"> to be human.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.219" end="00:04:06.769" style="s2"> I also have some other guidelines that I follow while teaching this lecture.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.769" end="00:04:11.859" style="s2"> One of them is that I don&#39;t want to tell you anything that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.859" end="00:04:17.799" style="s2"> is not useful to you. There is a difference between a fact and a useful fact.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.799" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2"> There are many facts, you can drown in facts with Google.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2"> Undoubtedly you do that every day. But a useful fact transforms the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:33.389" style="s2"> you see the world, or the way you act, in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.389" end="00:04:41.020" style="s2"> helpful. So another way of describing useful is as relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.020" end="00:04:44.740" style="s2"> One of the guidelines I follow is that I don&#39;t want to teach you anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.740" end="00:04:51.550" style="s2"> that is irrelevant. And my criteria for being relevant, first: does it help you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2"> in person? Are the things you learn immediately meaningful to how</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:01.509" style="s2"> you act in your life? And second: are there any indications that the facts you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.509" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2"> will be provided, be of social benefit,</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2"> or political or economic usefulness? So that your knowledge makes a difference</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:16.780" style="s2"> in the way you act, and that, that also affects the people around you.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.780" end="00:05:26.069" style="s2"> For those various reasons, I have compiled this material.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.069" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:34.650" style="s2"> That means you have to take into account a number of things,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.650" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2"> before you enroll in this college. And there is another lecture on personality theory,</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:44.659" style="s2"> at the same time. At least in this semester. It could be that, that college</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.659" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2"> suits you better than this college. But I can tell you how this college will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.289" style="s2"> expired. So if that&#39;s not what you want, or if you&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.289" end="00:05:56.300" style="s2"> interested, then you should not attend this lecture. First</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.300" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2"> you have to read a lot. It&#39;s less than what it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:06.909" style="s2"> but it is still a lot. And much of it is original</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.909" end="00:06:13.020" style="s2"> material, both from the personality theorists and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.020" end="00:06:17.870" style="s2"> of the empirical pieces. So it&#39;s not just a lot of reading,</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.870" end="00:06:23.430" style="s2"> but it is quite difficult reading. I think it is useful, according to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.430" end="00:06:28.970" style="s2"> the definition I have given. I think read what I offer you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.970" end="00:06:34.360" style="s2"> will be good for you. But if you don&#39;t have time to read a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.360" end="00:06:37.560" style="s2"> you will find college frustrating.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.560" end="00:06:45.310" style="s2"> Because of its emphasis on clinical theorists, what an important one</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.310" end="00:06:50.830" style="s2"> is part of personality theory, in particular classical personality theory,</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.830" end="00:06:54.949" style="s2"> the elements of personality theory that students are generally most interested in,</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.949" end="00:07:00.990" style="s2"> there is a lot of philosophical material. And it is philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.990" end="00:07:06.849" style="s2"> because it&#39;s about how a person should live. And that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.849" end="00:07:10.919" style="s2"> very different question than what a person is. How someone should live</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.919" end="00:07:16.050" style="s2"> or how someone can transform themselves, or act to transform themselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:22.090" style="s2"> so that his personality, so to speak, &quot;gets better.&quot; You can use &quot;healthier&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.090" end="00:07:26.789" style="s2"> instead of better, but in the context we are talking about,</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.789" end="00:07:29.370" style="s2"> is that difference trivial.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.370" end="00:07:35.780" style="s2"> The last thing I want to warn you about is that I don&#39;t lecture on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.780" end="00:07:42.449" style="s2"> the reading material. Often I myself will not know exactly what I am going to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.449" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2"> when I come to class. I know the material, but I don&#39;t want to be tied down to a prescribed schedule.</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:55.430" style="s2"> I want to talk to you about things that are important to me. With a bit of luck</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.430" end="00:08:02.210" style="s2"> the lectures will therefore be worthwhile to attend and listen to. But if you need more</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.210" end="00:08:07.479" style="s2"> have the need, from your temperament, for a college where things hurt</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.479" end="00:08:11.879" style="s2"> be orderly built up, develop linearly, be predictable,</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.879" end="00:08:17.289" style="s2"> and that the lectures follow the reading material, then this is not a suitable lecture for you.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.289" end="00:08:22.180" style="s2"> I guess that&#39;s the case if you&#39;re orderly. That is by the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.180" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2"> one of the components of the &quot;Big Five&quot; personality model. Orderly people</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:33.190" style="s2"> are often conscientious. But they like when things are organized and straightforward.</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.190" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2"> I&#39;m not that orderly. I score higher on openness, and openness is a creativity dimension.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:46.660" style="s2"> People who are open tend to associate fairly freely when they speak, and many different ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.660" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2"> domains to cover. Some people like that. For example, if you like literature,</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:58.389" style="s2"> you will probably find this lecture interesting. If you don&#39;t like that, then you probably won&#39;t find it interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.389" end="00:09:05.980" style="s2"> Well, that&#39;s enough warning. I will tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.980" end="00:09:12.070" style="s2"> what we&#39;re going to talk about.</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.070" end="00:09:21.410" style="s2"> One of the things that make people unique is the fact that we have self-awareness.</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.410" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2"> Ethologists, people who study animal behavior, are doing pretty basic</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:33.950" style="s2"> tests for self-awareness in animals. One of the most famous demonstrations of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.950" end="00:09:38.589" style="s2"> self-awareness is the mirror test. What you do in the mirror test,</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.589" end="00:09:44.870" style="s2"> you take an animal, a chimpanzee, or a three-year-old child, and you put one</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.870" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2"> draw on their forehead or nose with lipstick. And then you show them their reflection</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:55.010" style="s2"> in a mirror. And if they wipe the mark, or point to it,</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.010" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2"> you can assume they understand that they see themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:04.470" style="s2"> in the mirror. That they at least understand well enough to see the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.470" end="00:10:11.130" style="s2"> to be used as an aid to the action with their hand, or that with which they point,</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.130" end="00:10:16.529" style="s2"> and the reflection. Dolphins seem capable of this, a number of members</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.529" end="00:10:21.160" style="s2"> of the corvids, in fact crows and ravens, which are</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.160" end="00:10:26.820" style="s2"> highly intelligent, and they seem to have basic self-awareness. Dolphins I already said,</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.820" end="00:10:31.690" style="s2"> cetaceans in general, so whales, although I don&#39;t know if all whales have self-consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.690" end="00:10:37.139" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s hard to find a mirror big enough for a blue whale.</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.139" end="00:10:47.589" style="s2"> People, and that was it. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a very good definition of self-awareness,</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.589" end="00:10:51.420" style="s2"> because the fact that you can recognize yourself ... it&#39;s not fair to either</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.420" end="00:10:56.430" style="s2"> animals like dogs, because dogs would need a &quot;smell mirror&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.430" end="00:11:03.930" style="s2"> and most animals are smell oriented. Most of their brains are structured around the olfactory system</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.930" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2"> as core. Unlike us, because our brains are structured with the visual system</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:12.660" style="s2"> at the core, and that makes us peculiar. So it is unfair to animals like</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.660" end="00:11:17.410" style="s2"> dogs or rats, which rely primarily on smell to orient themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.410" end="00:11:21.220" style="s2"> But the point is, which I don&#39;t think is a good definition of self-awareness,</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.220" end="00:11:22.839" style="s2"> it is very basic.</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.839" end="00:11:27.870" style="s2"> You can say that it is the first step to self-awareness. Because if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.870" end="00:11:32.019" style="s2"> are completely self-aware, you need two other things. You need the power</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.019" end="00:11:38.019" style="s2"> to imitate, which is much more important than people generally think.</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.019" end="00:11:45.139" style="s2"> I would say it is as important as language.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.139" end="00:11:49.870" style="s2"> I&#39;m not even sure you can use language if you can&#39;t imitate. First,</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.870" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2"> all the words you use are words other people use. Otherwise you will not</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.790" end="00:11:59.339" style="s2"> are very understandable. The fact that you speak means you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.339" end="00:12:05.320" style="s2"> relies on imitation to get your message across. You need imitation</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.320" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2"> because once you can imitate, you can use your body as a means of representation</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:16.089" style="s2"> to represent the world and other people. You can even use your body as a representation</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.089" end="00:12:19.850" style="s2"> of yourself. For example, what you do when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.850" end="00:12:26.070" style="s2"> joke tells at a party and you parody yourself, and everyone laughs.</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.070" end="00:12:31.880" style="s2"> And when it comes to language, language allows you to be sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.880" end="00:12:36.610" style="s2"> to construct models of the world, which are well articulated, which you can exchange with other people, and which makes it possible to think.</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.610" end="00:12:37.149" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:12:37.149" end="00:12:42.550" style="s2"> To have self-awareness you must be able to recognize that you exist</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.550" end="00:12:48.329" style="s2"> in this physical form, here and now. You must be able to imitate</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.329" end="00:12:52.949" style="s2"> because that&#39;s how you understand yourself and other creatures like you,</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.949" end="00:12:57.769" style="s2"> which is an important part of self-awareness. Everything i about</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.769" end="00:13:02.350" style="s2"> your teachings will help me understand myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.350" end="00:13:09.290" style="s2"> for better or for worse. And with language we cannot only do our representations</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.290" end="00:13:14.050" style="s2"> of each other and the world, but we can also store those articulated representations</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.050" end="00:13:20.199" style="s2"> for a very long time. We do this partly in rituals, in which we</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.199" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2"> represent a representation physically. And partly we do that with stories,</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:31.160" style="s2"> which are, in a sense, an articulated representation of bodily action. Because you can see a story</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.160" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2"> like drama. A drama is behavior that represents behavior. And a story is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:45.500" style="s2"> an articulated version of a drama. We have very old rituals, and very</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.500" end="00:13:51.990" style="s2"> old stories. Part of what we will do in this college is to go back as close as possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.990" end="00:13:57.329" style="s2"> to the beginning, to understand how people themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.329" end="00:14:03.290" style="s2"> understood and represented throughout human history. And we do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.290" end="00:14:08.069" style="s2"> because we want to be able to place our current knowledge in a historical context.</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.069" end="00:14:08.589" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:08.589" end="00:14:14.670" style="s2"> Because, one of the things that characterizes a human personality,</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.670" end="00:14:19.829" style="s2"> is that it is a historical phenomenon. Undoubtedly you hear in many lessons</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.829" end="00:14:26.029" style="s2"> that much of your personality is a cultural construct. Or that now</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.029" end="00:14:30.009" style="s2"> is a lot or not, it doesn&#39;t matter. Part of it is for sure, an important part,</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.009" end="00:14:34.690" style="s2"> you are a cultural being. You come from a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.690" end="00:14:41.380" style="s2"> which has been shaped in countless ways by a very long past,</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.380" end="00:14:48.410" style="s2"> historical and biological. That means if you do, your history</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.410" end="00:14:55.490" style="s2"> does not understand your relevant past, not just any collection</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.490" end="00:15:01.690" style="s2"> facts, then you don&#39;t understand yourself. People in their self-conscious form,</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.690" end="00:15:08.750" style="s2"> we don&#39;t know how old we are. Biologically or genetically identical</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.750" end="00:15:15.250" style="s2"> creatures to us existed 150 thousand years ago. But it seems we discovered fire</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.250" end="00:15:20.509" style="s2"> and were able to control it about two million years ago. That requires quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.509" end="00:15:30.920" style="s2"> intelligence. And there are artifacts that attest to a fairly high cultural level</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.920" end="00:15:36.589" style="s2"> that are at least 50 thousand years old. So we cannot say exactly when we became fully self-aware.</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.589" end="00:15:40.810" style="s2"> And we could also say we&#39;re still not fully self-aware,</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.810" end="00:15:44.089" style="s2"> because what do we actually know about ourselves?</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.089" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2"> We are very complex. At most you have a limited model of who you are,</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:52.899" style="s2"> and that constantly fails. Because you keep doing things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.899" end="00:16:00.100" style="s2"> surprise you, and often not in a particularly positive way. The mystery remains.</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.100" end="00:16:07.410" style="s2"> That means we&#39;ll outline the context first,</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.410" end="00:16:12.410" style="s2"> the historical context. I want to do that in two ways. The first thing that wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.410" end="00:16:19.129" style="s2"> is to discuss mythological representations of personality. And that is more important</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.129" end="00:16:26.449" style="s2"> than you may think. It&#39;s probably more important than you actually think.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.449" end="00:16:35.690" style="s2"> By myth I mean the representations of people in very old and timeless stories.</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.690" end="00:16:41.800" style="s2"> Some of them are the stories you find in religious traditions,</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.800" end="00:16:45.149" style="s2"> but there are also oral traditions that accompany religious traditions. If we assume</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.149" end="00:16:49.589" style="s2"> the recorded religious traditions, and there are fairytales too, and things like that,</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.589" end="00:16:54.730" style="s2"> and standard narratives that people used to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.730" end="00:17:02.019" style="s2"> in the world. And most of the clinical theories we&#39;re going to discuss, like Freud&#39;s theory,</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.019" end="00:17:05.870" style="s2"> and Jung&#39;s theory, and the theory of the existentialists and phenomenologists,</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.870" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2"> and the humanists, et cetera, are variations on those mythological stories.</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:17.559" style="s2"> This is partly because ... Nietzsche once said that a philosopher was rarely anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.559" end="00:17:25.559" style="s2"> an unconscious advocate for the prevailing cultural worldview. He meant that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.559" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2"> you&#39;ve always had assumptions. Some of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:35.039" style="s2"> are anchored in your behavior. For example, if you are attending a funeral,</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.039" end="00:17:38.919" style="s2"> do you know how to behave. You are generally quiet and reverent. You may not be able</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.919" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2"> Explain the rules a person must obey at a funeral, but you can. You can</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.000" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2"> maybe explain them if you think about it, but it&#39;s not like you follow those rules</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2"> when you go to a funeral. You just know what to do. If anyone were to push, you would</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:58.700" style="s2"> make a list of rules. But in fact it is coded in your behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.700" end="00:18:03.030" style="s2"> You automatically know what to do. You can see it when you handle</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.030" end="00:18:08.280" style="s2"> with someone who is very social, you see that he is not aware</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.280" end="00:18:13.480" style="s2"> is processing the way he acts, because then he would be self-aware and uncomfortable.</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.480" end="00:18:18.490" style="s2"> He behaves smoothly. That is automated behavior, and it is coded &quot;in him&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.490" end="00:18:22.429" style="s2"> And if you&#39;re a great philosopher, what you do according to Nietzsche is your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.429" end="00:18:27.559" style="s2"> and observe your thoughts, and describe it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.559" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2"> You are not so much inventing new ideas as articulating the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:34.640" style="s2"> the structures that are already there.</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:40.570" style="s2"> Imagine that you are particularly interested in wolves.</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.570" end="00:18:44.350" style="s2"> So you go out and study some wolves, and one of the things you see is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.350" end="00:18:49.780" style="s2"> the wolves have a social hierarchy. There is a leader, and then there is a battle</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.780" end="00:18:54.929" style="s2"> in the pack to see who will become the dominant leader. That poses a problem,</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.929" end="00:19:00.730" style="s2"> because when wolf A and wolf B fight, and they are similar,</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.730" end="00:19:04.530" style="s2"> and they tear each other up, then wolf C comes and takes them both.</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.530" end="00:19:10.200" style="s2"> That&#39;s not a useful strategy for wolf A and wolf B. And then the pack loses</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.200" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2"> the power of wolf A and wolf B, so that&#39;s not functional. What has happened,</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:20.450" style="s2"> is that wolves have developed strategies for dominance and submission. So that they can determine</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.450" end="00:19:25.340" style="s2"> who will lead, and who will follow, without</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.340" end="00:19:29.390" style="s2"> having to engage in a physical fight that will cause damage.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.390" end="00:19:33.740" style="s2"> What usually happens is that two wolves face off, you probably have cats</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.740" end="00:19:37.400" style="s2"> sometimes see them do this when they meet on the street. The first thing they do</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.400" end="00:19:41.549" style="s2"> is to turn to the side and blow themselves up, and they dance back and forth,</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.549" end="00:19:45.210" style="s2"> quite comical. But what the cat tries to do is look big</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.210" end="00:19:50.059" style="s2"> he tries to make the other cat so nervous that he leaves. And what wolves do</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.059" end="00:19:53.470" style="s2"> is about the same. They blow themselves up so they look big, make all kinds of savage</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.470" end="00:19:59.330" style="s2"> noises, and they threaten each other. And usually one wolf will give in</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.330" end="00:20:04.130" style="s2"> Lie down, lie on his back, and expose his throat. That means something like:</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.130" end="00:20:08.730" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m useless and pathetic, and you can bite my throat if you want to.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.730" end="00:20:12.950" style="s2"> And another wolf thinks, &quot;Yeah you&#39;re pretty useless and pathetic, but</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.950" end="00:20:16.289" style="s2"> we need you tomorrow to get a deer, so</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.289" end="00:20:21.620" style="s2"> you can get up and protect your miserable self, and that&#39;s okay. ”Seeing that,</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.620" end="00:20:26.520" style="s2"> you might say, &quot;Wolves follow rules.&quot; But they don&#39;t, that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.520" end="00:20:31.370" style="s2"> just their behavior. When you describe what the wolves do, you turn it into a rule.</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.370" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2"> But it was not originally a rule. It was a pattern of behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:41.159" style="s2"> That&#39;s how people are. We are full of behavioral patterns. And that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.159" end="00:20:45.690" style="s2"> the result of our biology. Which we&#39;ll talk about in detail in the second half</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.690" end="00:20:49.890" style="s2"> of the course. And it is a result of our culture. And that is built into our body.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.890" end="00:20:54.360" style="s2"> Everytime you hang out with someone he&#39;ll tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.360" end="00:21:00.230" style="s2"> you have to behave. &quot;Don&#39;t be too slow.&quot; &quot;Try to be witty.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.230" end="00:21:03.740" style="s2"> &quot;Tell something interesting.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t be so obnoxious.&quot; &quot;If you something</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.740" end="00:21:08.620" style="s2"> funny, make sure it&#39;s really funny. &quot;&quot; Take turns speaking. &quot;&quot; Play nicely. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.620" end="00:21:14.650" style="s2"> &quot;Wait your turn.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t eat all the bread.&quot; Etcetera.</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.650" end="00:21:21.140" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t follow those rules, people will raise an eyebrow. Or they don&#39;t laugh</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.140" end="00:21:24.409" style="s2"> for your jokes. Or they look away. Or they roll their eyes when you enter</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.409" end="00:21:30.750" style="s2"> which is a very bad sign by the way. You will be severely punished for it.</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.750" end="00:21:34.529" style="s2"> And when you act the way they want people to smile at you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.529" end="00:21:38.270" style="s2"> they invite you over for dinner, maybe you&#39;re in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.270" end="00:21:42.630" style="s2"> and people who like you. So we exchange information about</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.630" end="00:21:48.570" style="s2"> how to manifest ourselves physically, in every interaction.</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.570" end="00:21:51.100" style="s2"> That shapes the way we act.</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.100" end="00:21:56.070" style="s2"> The problem is, you don&#39;t really understand the consequences.</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.070" end="00:22:00.419" style="s2"> You can act intuitively based on your social skills,</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.419" end="00:22:05.260" style="s2"> and the degree to which you interact with other people, but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.260" end="00:22:09.340" style="s2"> you can consciously formulate all implicit rules.</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.340" end="00:22:15.640" style="s2"> And if you think you can ... Imagine a well-behaved four-year-old.</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.640" end="00:22:21.179" style="s2"> When you are four, you have mastered many of the social rules because when you are four, you can play</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.179" end="00:22:25.720" style="s2"> with others. If you&#39;re ever going to be able to, you can do it at the age of four.</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.720" end="00:22:30.309" style="s2"> If you can&#39;t do that by the age of four, you have a serious problem. Because other children</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.309" end="00:22:33.730" style="s2"> don&#39;t play with you, and then you don&#39;t learn how to behave. And then you remain immature</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.730" end="00:22:40.230" style="s2"> and isolated. In a corner, dejected and bitter</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.230" end="00:22:44.220" style="s2"> for the rest of your life. You may think that what is harsh, but it is not.</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.220" end="00:22:46.429" style="s2"> That&#39;s what the data points to.</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.429" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2"> We have shaped our behavior,</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2"> since we are social. Then you ask the question: &quot;How long have we been social?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:12.630" style="s2"> Crustaceans are social. Cancer, for example, organize themselves into social hierarchies,</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.630" end="00:23:18.600" style="s2"> and they adapt each other&#39;s behavior. And that is 400 million years old.</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.600" end="00:23:28.580" style="s2"> We are social and live in groups since our ancestors separated in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.580" end="00:23:33.570" style="s2"> of the ancestors of lobsters. That is a very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.570" end="00:23:41.289" style="s2"> Then there were no trees yet. Social life is older than trees. So you can be sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.289" end="00:23:46.399" style="s2"> that you are highly adapted to it. It&#39;s built into your biology,</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.399" end="00:23:53.029" style="s2"> but there is also a historical element. We are quite flexible from one</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.029" end="00:23:54.090" style="s2"> cultural perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.090" end="00:23:59.380" style="s2"> There is one example, someone named Robert Sapolsky, who I like, he is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.380" end="00:24:06.580" style="s2"> a great scientist. He went to Africa to study baboons. And baboons are generally not friendly.</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.580" end="00:24:10.840" style="s2"> They fight a lot. They are bullies. They bite. They can bite hard.</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.840" end="00:24:16.570" style="s2"> A feline is not likely to attack a baboon. They have large teeth.</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.570" end="00:24:21.860" style="s2"> And their temperament is not particularly positive. Sapolsky studied a group</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.860" end="00:24:27.850" style="s2"> baboons, with typical baboon behavior, bother each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.850" end="00:24:31.159" style="s2"> and bullying. They were very stressed. Sapolsky knew that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.159" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2"> because he measured their testosterone levels and things like that. It was</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:41.299" style="s2"> a pretty miserable life as a baboon. But then what happened was the baboons somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.299" end="00:24:47.070" style="s2"> went for food, and many got tuberculosis.</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.070" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2"> And almost all very aggressive males got tuberculosis and died,</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:56.380" style="s2"> and only the &quot;beta males&quot; remained. And then it transformed</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.380" end="00:25:00.440" style="s2"> the whole baboon culture, which made them much more friendly and cooperative.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.440" end="00:25:05.990" style="s2"> And if aggressive baboons entered only that territory,</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.990" end="00:25:10.840" style="s2"> they also became calm and calm. That&#39;s interesting, because of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.840" end="00:25:16.760" style="s2"> Baboons aren&#39;t as social as we are, but it does indicate that too</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.760" end="00:25:21.450" style="s2"> developed primates (their brains are quite large, but not as big as ours), that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.450" end="00:25:26.409" style="s2"> transfer of behavioral expectation, can be very strong and can transform quite quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.409" end="00:25:31.710" style="s2"> We have shaped each other&#39;s behavior for a very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.710" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2"> And much of it is coded deeply in biology and in culture.</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:43.649" style="s2"> From an organic point of view, we&#39;ll discuss this in detail in the organic part ...</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.649" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2"> One of the ways you can tell how social you are is by seeing how much pain and shame you are experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:53.799" style="s2"> if you make a social mistake. When you&#39;re at a party and you embarrass yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.799" end="00:25:57.830" style="s2"> depending on your level of &quot;neuroticism,&quot; which is a Big Five trait</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.830" end="00:26:02.510" style="s2"> that indicates how sensitive you are to negative feelings, you may be</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.510" end="00:26:05.830" style="s2"> obsessed with your stupidity for the next three or four months, or even years.</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.830" end="00:26:12.740" style="s2"> People don&#39;t like social exclusion. You have a small counter</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.740" end="00:26:17.320" style="s2"> in the back of your brain, that roughly</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.320" end="00:26:21.159" style="s2"> estimate how successful you are. There seems to be an estimate</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.159" end="00:26:27.010" style="s2"> during birth, when your neurotic level is set. That can be adjusted,</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.010" end="00:26:32.450" style="s2"> to some extent, through learning processes. If you are a &quot;tall&quot; baboon, you will</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.450" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2"> Experiencing less negative emotions, and more pleasure, than when you are a &quot;low&quot; baboon.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2"> And it is exactly the same in humans. We like to rise in the social hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:45.860" style="s2"> And we like to be near the top of the social hierarchy. And as the counter</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.860" end="00:26:49.710" style="s2"> in the back of your brain notices that you are doing a good job</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.710" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2"> rises in the social hierarchy, it produces more serotonin.</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:58.309" style="s2"> Then you will experience less pain and less depression.</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.309" end="00:27:03.409" style="s2"> And less tension, less stress, et cetera. So there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.409" end="00:27:08.149" style="s2"> a biological basis for our social existence, and it is very important to us how we get into it</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.149" end="00:27:09.960" style="s2"> social groups.</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.960" end="00:27:17.470" style="s2"> We&#39;ve been trying to find out what we are, who we are,</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.470" end="00:27:23.100" style="s2"> for thousands of years. Partly as a result of imitation, because</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.100" end="00:27:27.140" style="s2"> I can act like you, and that helps me understand who you are. And partly if</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.140" end="00:27:32.669" style="s2"> a consequence of articulated communication. Much of it consists of stories.</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.669" end="00:27:38.909" style="s2"> We have no idea since when people tell stories. When you visit nations</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.909" end="00:27:43.649" style="s2"> who have no written language, and who were isolated from the rest of society,</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.649" end="00:27:48.260" style="s2"> for thousands of years (such peoples still exist), you will find that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.260" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2"> they tell stories, they dance, they represent each other. We know that tendency</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.919" end="00:27:58.820" style="s2"> to tell stories and perform rituals is much older than our ability to write.</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.820" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2"> I think it is at least 50 thousand years old, although I suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.600" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2"> it is much older. Over time we started</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:17.940" style="s2"> by telling stories about each other that represent how we act.</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.940" end="00:28:21.190" style="s2"> And some of those stories are interesting and we remember, and others we don&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.190" end="00:28:25.830" style="s2"> And we continue to remember and pass on the interesting and memorable stories.</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.830" end="00:28:31.640" style="s2"> You can imagine how people gathered in groups of thousands,</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.640" end="00:28:36.590" style="s2"> for thousands of years, telling each other stories,</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.590" end="00:28:41.429" style="s2"> and get those stories into some kind of acceptable and understandable form.</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.429" end="00:28:47.850" style="s2"> For example, if you look at the creation story,</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.850" end="00:28:52.299" style="s2"> the creation story in Genesis in the Old Testament, that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.299" end="00:28:58.789" style="s2"> a group of creation stories, characteristic of the mythology of the Middle East. It seems to have arisen</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.789" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2"> through the organization of various Middle Eastern tribes thousands of years ago,</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2"> each with its own traditions, to a relatively homogeneous story, which was characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:19.490" style="s2"> for the most important beliefs of a large group of people. So we have information on how we act</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.490" end="00:29:23.990" style="s2"> through its representations, which we have passed down,</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.990" end="00:29:30.190" style="s2"> and a lot of it takes the form of mythology, religious stories. We go</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.190" end="00:29:37.710" style="s2"> start the lecture with two themes that lay foundations. The first</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.710" end="00:29:45.179" style="s2"> has to do with the structure of mythological representations, and the second has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.179" end="00:29:52.230" style="s2"> a collection of rituals, processes and beliefs found all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.230" end="00:29:54.870" style="s2"> and dealing with shamanic transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.870" end="00:29:59.779" style="s2"> The title of this lecture is &quot;Personality and Its Transformations,&quot; the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.779" end="00:30:05.649" style="s2"> is because you are not who you are. You&#39;re something</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.649" end="00:30:10.610" style="s2"> constantly changing. You are more like a river than a stone. You are constantly transforming.</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.610" end="00:30:17.000" style="s2"> The physicist Erwin Schrödinger thought people</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.000" end="00:30:22.510" style="s2"> composite structures. It&#39;s an interesting idea. A composite structure is a structure</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.510" end="00:30:28.750" style="s2"> which maintains its shape, while its elements change completely.</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.750" end="00:30:31.720" style="s2"> If you let the water drain from the sink, you get a whirlpool, right? The whirlpool</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.720" end="00:30:37.179" style="s2"> is a fairly stable entity, but the water that makes up the basin is constantly changing.</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.179" end="00:30:41.340" style="s2"> That is a composite structure. So are you. Your shape remains the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:47.159" style="s2"> over time, but your elements keep changing. And humans are very changeable beings.</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.159" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2"> Unlike animals, because animals are more or less what they are,</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:57.940" style="s2"> and that&#39;s it. They have the ability to learn, but that doesn&#39;t go very far.</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.940" end="00:31:03.289" style="s2"> The typical beaver does much the same today as its distant ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.289" end="00:31:10.980" style="s2"> five thousand years ago. There is no real culture building, while we humans,</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.980" end="00:31:16.779" style="s2"> we transform very strongly. We do that culturally. There are so many things</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.779" end="00:31:20.029" style="s2"> that are different now from twenty years ago, you can, you hardly can</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.029" end="00:31:20.669" style="s2"> introduce.</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.669" end="00:31:25.389" style="s2"> We transform quite quickly on a cultural level, but we do that individually.</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.389" end="00:31:30.789" style="s2"> You have all just made the transition to college.</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.789" end="00:31:35.210" style="s2"> In a number of ways you are the same as in high school,</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.210" end="00:31:38.960" style="s2"> but hopefully you are better in many ways now than you were in high school.</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.960" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2"> You should be more mature, and your personality can be greatly transformed.</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:49.580" style="s2"> And with a little luck you will not be finished with your transformations.</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.580" end="00:31:52.909" style="s2"> It will stay that way for the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.909" end="00:31:58.070" style="s2"> if you are a dynamic person, have your eyes open, are attentive, and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.070" end="00:32:03.230" style="s2"> can learn. You can say that the most stable part of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.230" end="00:32:07.960" style="s2"> the personality, the ability to change. And it is worth it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.960" end="00:32:11.940" style="s2"> to know. Because one of the things I can tell you about the great myths</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.940" end="00:32:15.960" style="s2"> of humanity (there are many, with different themes), but one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.960" end="00:32:23.980" style="s2"> powerful themes are: you overcome your problems by transforming your personality.</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.980" end="00:32:28.389" style="s2"> You actually always do that when you learn something. Because you learn something</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.389" end="00:32:31.610" style="s2"> and hopefully you are something different than before. Hopefully different</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.610" end="00:32:35.700" style="s2"> in an important way, and hopefully differently in a way that helps you solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.700" end="00:32:41.340" style="s2"> that you couldn&#39;t solve before. You can say that one of the leitmotifs of human life is:</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.340" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2"> “When I encounter an obstacle, I can transform myself and discover a way</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:50.389" style="s2"> to pass it. ”And that makes us quite remarkable.</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.389" end="00:32:57.330" style="s2"> Which I could suggest to you, and I think this is one of the biggest ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.330" end="00:33:03.340" style="s2"> that exist (that can be communicated in this short time frame) is that it is better</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.340" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2"> to identify with your ability to transform, than to identify with who you are now.</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:14.029" style="s2"> That can save you a lot of trouble. One of the things that characterize</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.029" end="00:33:18.409" style="s2"> ideologues, or people trapped in fixed belief systems, is them</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.409" end="00:33:22.669" style="s2"> worship who they are now. And that would be fine if everything was one hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.669" end="00:33:27.059" style="s2"> would go well with them, but that is rarely the case. So unless your life is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.059" end="00:33:33.240" style="s2"> and that&#39;s highly unlikely, it might be better if you were someone else.</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.240" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2"> That&#39;s all you have because change the world in a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:41.450" style="s2"> that will make you feel better ... You might succeed</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.450" end="00:33:46.659" style="s2"> in a limited area, but the chances that this can, or should, on a large scale,</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.659" end="00:33:50.100" style="s2"> is quite small.</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:55.850" style="s2"> So in the section on mythological representation I&#39;ll be going to the basic</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.850" end="00:34:02.549" style="s2"> discuss elements of the story. I think, that&#39;s necessary because there</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.549" end="00:34:07.769" style="s2"> are two things to consider when talking about people.</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.769" end="00:34:14.350" style="s2"> First, objectively, what is a person? In the same way as you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.350" end="00:34:20.100" style="s2"> examine a rat or a stone. That&#39;s a scientific question.</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.100" end="00:34:26.190" style="s2"> But then there is one more question, or maybe two questions: how do people act?</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.190" end="00:34:32.210" style="s2"> And: how should they act? And maybe the first is a scientific question,</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.210" end="00:34:38.220" style="s2"> but the second is certainly not. And the way in which we investigate how people act</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.220" end="00:34:42.730" style="s2"> and how they should act has much more to do with storytelling than science.</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.730" end="00:34:45.790" style="s2"> You know that. Think about it,</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.790" end="00:34:50.140" style="s2"> How do you get most of your information about what people are like, if you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.140" end="00:34:54.730" style="s2"> actually interacts with people? The answer is quite simple:</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.730" end="00:35:00.140" style="s2"> you read novels, you read literature, you watch movies, you watch &quot;Game of Thrones,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.140" end="00:35:05.190" style="s2"> you watch &quot;Star Wars,&quot; you may be standing</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.190" end="00:35:10.050" style="s2"> three days in line, if you&#39;re completely insane, to watch Star Wars.</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.050" end="00:35:15.300" style="s2"> Then you can ask, &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; People hunger for information</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.300" end="00:35:23.900" style="s2"> about how people act, and how they should act. And we are fascinated by stories.</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.900" end="00:35:26.980" style="s2"> That has a reason. You know what a story is and what isn&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.980" end="00:35:31.290" style="s2"> You go to a movie and think, &quot;The development of the characters</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.290" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2"> was good, but the story was bad. ”Then you talk to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:39.980" style="s2"> your friends about why it was a bad story. But the strange thing is that you actually already know.</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.980" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2"> Some things are stories and some are not. And explain some something</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:52.540" style="s2"> making a story is difficult. But you do know, and you can even agree on it.</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.540" end="00:35:59.070" style="s2"> If you look at &quot;IMDB&quot; or &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, there is great agreement</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.070" end="00:36:04.570" style="s2"> about what an acceptable story is, pretty quickly. There seems to be a certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.570" end="00:36:10.410" style="s2"> amount to be consistent, with some individual differences.</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.410" end="00:36:19.580" style="s2"> The mythological and shamanic talks we will have have a number of purposes.</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.580" end="00:36:26.360" style="s2"> One is to provide you with basic concepts that you can use</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.360" end="00:36:32.090" style="s2"> to understand stories. That will be very useful because most</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.090" end="00:36:37.630" style="s2"> clinical theories we will cover are actually story-based.</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.630" end="00:36:42.710" style="s2"> And once you understand the underlying mythological structure, you have a framework</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.710" end="00:36:47.500" style="s2"> within which you can place the theories. What is complicated about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.500" end="00:36:52.130" style="s2"> personality theory, is that there are many theories. And you may think:</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.130" end="00:36:57.930" style="s2"> &quot;How is that possible?&quot; Because if it&#39;s a theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.930" end="00:37:00.900" style="s2"> can be only one. Just as there is only one theory of relativity,</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.900" end="00:37:05.740" style="s2"> there is some confusion at the borders, but everyone agrees on the core elements.</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.740" end="00:37:12.750" style="s2"> There are many different theories in personality theory.</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.750" end="00:37:16.030" style="s2"> Then you might think, &quot;How are you going to make sense of that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.030" end="00:37:21.840" style="s2"> In two ways. First, by anchoring them all in a more fundamental structure,</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.840" end="00:37:25.020" style="s2"> and that is something I am trying to achieve with this course.</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.020" end="00:37:30.100" style="s2"> Second, by adopting a different set of assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.100" end="00:37:31.620" style="s2"> about personality theories.</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.620" end="00:37:36.700" style="s2"> You can say, &quot;There is only one theory of relativity.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.700" end="00:37:42.610" style="s2"> &quot;Yes, there is only one theory of relativity, but consider a toolbox.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.610" end="00:37:48.350" style="s2"> Maybe some of you are handy, and you have a toolbox. What&#39;s in a tool box?</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.350" end="00:37:56.860" style="s2"> Hammers, or a hammer, saws, wrenches, pliers, clamps, et cetera. And you can say:</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.860" end="00:38:04.740" style="s2"> &quot;Tools, what do you need all those tools for?&quot; And the answer is:</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.740" end="00:38:08.410" style="s2"> &quot;You can hit a nail with a wrench, but it would be better to</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.410" end="00:38:11.890" style="s2"> to use a hammer. And you could knock a bolt off with a hammer, but it would be better</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.890" end="00:38:16.140" style="s2"> to use a wrench. &quot;When you try to do something</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.140" end="00:38:22.650" style="s2"> what is complicated and complex, why not use different tools? Normally</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.650" end="00:38:29.360" style="s2"> we don&#39;t see scientific theories as tools, although they are. Above all, they are tools.</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.360" end="00:38:30.050" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:30.050" end="00:38:33.470" style="s2"> And if we&#39;re dealing with something as complex as a human, maybe we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.470" end="00:38:37.640" style="s2"> requires more than one tool to get the job done.</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.640" end="00:38:43.120" style="s2"> To say that you understand a person is a complicated thing.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.120" end="00:38:48.570" style="s2"> You may ask, &quot;Understand for what purpose?&quot; You don&#39;t mean complete, universal,</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.570" end="00:38:52.740" style="s2"> comprehensive understanding. You mean, &quot;I want to know X about someone because</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.740" end="00:38:58.670" style="s2"> I want something in my dealings with him. ”There are all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.670" end="00:39:05.010" style="s2"> tools that can help with this. I&#39;d say Freud is a microscope</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.010" end="00:39:10.120" style="s2"> and Jung a telescope. That&#39;s how you can see it. There is no reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.120" end="00:39:14.440" style="s2"> that I compared them to those two instruments, but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.440" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2"> that if you carefully study personality theories, they improve your ability</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:26.530" style="s2"> represent yourself, in very useful ways. Because you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.530" end="00:39:33.180" style="s2"> who you are, and why, and what consequences this has for you. Because you can transform</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.180" end="00:39:37.120" style="s2"> but you also have a fairly stable underlying structure.</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.120" end="00:39:43.610" style="s2"> Otherwise you would be soft like an octopus. You are a curious dynamic combination of a relative</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.610" end="00:39:50.770" style="s2"> permanent structure, with the capacity to transform. You have your own nature, and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.770" end="00:39:55.050" style="s2"> understanding your nature is very rewarding. Hopefully you will</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.050" end="00:39:59.540" style="s2"> during this lecture you get a number of tools to understand yourself and others.</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.540" end="00:40:05.130" style="s2"> Tools that are really useful, things that you can use on a daily basis</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.130" end="00:40:10.320" style="s2"> understand yourself and your family, and improve your future, with a little luck.</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.320" end="00:40:17.380" style="s2"> We will also discuss the elements that are stable, most of which have been discovered,</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.380" end="00:40:23.370" style="s2"> at least in the more objective sense, by biological psychologists. Especially by</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.370" end="00:40:25.590" style="s2"> animal research, strangely enough.</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.590" end="00:40:30.520" style="s2"> Well, mythological representations, we&#39;re going back in time.</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.520" end="00:40:37.820" style="s2"> We are going to look at archaic and ancient stories of humanity, as people have told each other.</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.820" end="00:40:43.470" style="s2"> I&#39;ll focus on stories that already ... we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.470" end="00:40:49.540" style="s2"> how old they are. We have stories that are four thousand years old in written form.</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.540" end="00:40:55.390" style="s2"> But all the evidence indicates that those stories are based on traditions that are much older,</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.390" end="00:41:02.370" style="s2"> at least fifty thousand years, and maybe even older. We&#39;ll check them out,</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.370" end="00:41:06.330" style="s2"> and that will give us a foundation on which to build. After that we go</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.330" end="00:41:13.740" style="s2"> View shamanic rituals and descriptions to get a feel for the archetype of transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.740" end="00:41:18.860" style="s2"> What do you have to undergo when you change?</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.860" end="00:41:22.570" style="s2"> What will you experience when that happens? I can already say something about that.</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.570" end="00:41:30.840" style="s2"> It is not always the case, it may rarely be the case that if you do something</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.840" end="00:41:37.080" style="s2"> important teaches that it is pleasant. This happens to people all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.080" end="00:41:42.130" style="s2"> Maybe you recently had a relationship where things went completely wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.130" end="00:41:45.210" style="s2"> Maybe it was because your friend was a bastard, or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.210" end="00:41:49.260" style="s2"> are you not so sensible. No doubt you are trying to find out</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.260" end="00:41:54.130" style="s2"> which option is the right one, when you think about the relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.130" end="00:41:58.830" style="s2"> What usually happens to people when they move towards a certain goal, and it goes wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.830" end="00:42:04.440" style="s2"> because something happens that they do not understand and could not foresee,</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.440" end="00:42:08.550" style="s2"> maybe in their own behavior, maybe you had an affair during your relationship, and you did</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.550" end="00:42:14.490" style="s2"> not expected ... What is happening is that your current model of yourself and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.490" end="00:42:22.190" style="s2"> even of the world turns out to be wrong. That upsets you very much.</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.190" end="00:42:26.850" style="s2"> Then you are upset for a while, little motivated, somewhat depressed, quite tense,</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.850" end="00:42:31.640" style="s2"> you collapse, you don&#39;t know what to do. And if you are lucky</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.640" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2"> you think about it, and you talk about it, and you get up again. And when you get there</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2"> you&#39;ve gone through, you&#39;re a bit smarter, a bit stronger than you</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.280" end="00:42:40.300" style="s2"> was before.</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.300" end="00:42:45.490" style="s2"> If you&#39;re unlucky, you&#39;ll be left in the dumps. People can stay in for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.490" end="00:42:50.430" style="s2"> stay put, and that&#39;s not a good thing. The transformation process</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.430" end="00:42:54.760" style="s2"> is quite dangerous because it is not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.760" end="00:43:00.990" style="s2"> to finish successfully. But is there a pattern, and it usually is:</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.990" end="00:43:05.790" style="s2"> you think you know what you are doing, and then something happens that makes it clear</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.790" end="00:43:11.140" style="s2"> that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. And then you have a problem. And through</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.140" end="00:43:16.600" style="s2"> careful analysis, support and conversations (and other processes we don&#39;t really understand),</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.600" end="00:43:24.030" style="s2"> you integrate the unknown knowledge that brought you down,</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.030" end="00:43:32.370" style="s2"> you reconstruct your personality, and your representations of the world. And then you move forward again.</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.370" end="00:43:37.230" style="s2"> Hopefully better than before. But that&#39;s interesting to know.</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.230" end="00:43:41.310" style="s2"> Nietzsche said you can see how much character someone has</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.310" end="00:43:46.820" style="s2"> by how much truth he can handle. That&#39;s an interesting statement,</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.820" end="00:43:50.370" style="s2"> for people, because they are optimistic, generally regard the truth</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.370" end="00:43:54.820" style="s2"> as something positive. &quot;Obviously it is better to know the truth.&quot; No, if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.820" end="00:43:59.180" style="s2"> usually fools yourself, finding out the truth is not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.180" end="00:44:02.630" style="s2"> That doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t,</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.630" end="00:44:12.050" style="s2"> but the idea that the road to enlightenment is a pleasant one is not very intelligent.</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.050" end="00:44:14.820" style="s2"> The opposite is true.</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.820" end="00:44:20.730" style="s2"> Shamanistic rituals make this visible in an archetypal way.</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.730" end="00:44:26.260" style="s2"> What you see happening with the typical ... shamanism is also a worldwide phenomenon,</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.260" end="00:44:32.990" style="s2"> and it appears to be related to a primitive or archaic psychology of transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.990" end="00:44:40.340" style="s2"> Often resources are used. What generally happens is that the shamanic transformation is accompanied</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.340" end="00:44:46.750" style="s2"> by descending into some kind of psychological death, and then rebuilding,</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.750" end="00:44:51.020" style="s2"> a rebirth from which the person emerges. Like an initiation ritual,</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.020" end="00:44:55.120" style="s2"> you can see it that way. Or you can see it as</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.120" end="00:45:02.390" style="s2"> the depression you experienced during your first semester in college,</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:06.140" style="s2"> which made you leave university, because that happens to a lot of people,</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.140" end="00:45:11.100" style="s2"> or whatever you overcame, to eventually become a student. Although that may be</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.100" end="00:45:15.330" style="s2"> was not a pleasant transition. We tested students,</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.330" end="00:45:19.500" style="s2"> and it is interesting to note that about a third of you meet the criteria for</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.500" end="00:45:24.120" style="s2"> clinical depression in your first year. I think that indicates the criteria for</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.120" end="00:45:29.240" style="s2"> clinical depression a bit too sensitive. Because if</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.240" end="00:45:33.530" style="s2"> a third of the people meet the criteria, you think: &quot;Yes, that&#39;s a bit sensitive.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.530" end="00:45:40.350" style="s2"> Nevertheless, it is not an easy transition. Your old &quot;self&quot; must die.</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.350" end="00:45:45.380" style="s2"> In general, that is not pleasant. And that&#39;s a good way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.380" end="00:45:49.260" style="s2"> obstacles to learning. Because you rarely learn anything without being part of you</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.260" end="00:45:53.980" style="s2"> dies first. Therefore, people have resistance to learning things like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.980" end="00:45:55.070" style="s2"> are new and important.</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.070" end="00:46:00.710" style="s2"> Okay, then we&#39;ll talk about Piaget.</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.710" end="00:46:09.480" style="s2"> Piaget isn&#39;t known as a personality psychologist, but that&#39;s okay.</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.480" end="00:46:14.840" style="s2"> Piaget was a developmental psychologist, perhaps the most important.</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.840" end="00:46:20.520" style="s2"> He has published many books, many of which have not yet been translated.</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.520" end="00:46:24.590" style="s2"> And some have not even been published yet. Piaget has thought about many things.</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.590" end="00:46:29.020" style="s2"> He is known for his phase theory of development,</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.020" end="00:46:32.830" style="s2"> but he wasn&#39;t very fond of it. It seems to be part of his body of thought</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.830" end="00:46:39.230" style="s2"> that simplistic Western intellectuals found the easiest,</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.230" end="00:46:44.690" style="s2"> and that&#39;s why it&#39;s usually about that. But Piaget was a very sophisticated thinker.</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:50.370" style="s2"> What he was interested in was how a child was</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.370" end="00:46:54.380" style="s2"> &quot;boots itself up.&quot; That&#39;s how you can see it. Because if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.380" end="00:47:00.090" style="s2"> Turn on a computer, what then happens is that it has some simple functions</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.090" end="00:47:04.820" style="s2"> start up first. And those functions make it possible to do more complex</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.820" end="00:47:10.260" style="s2"> to start up. And those functions make it possible to start up even more complex functions.</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.260" end="00:47:16.820" style="s2"> And soon your computer is ready for you. People are like that.</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.820" end="00:47:22.660" style="s2"> If we are just born, we are very primitive. Are we very immature,</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.660" end="00:47:25.750" style="s2"> that&#39;s better wording. We&#39;re not really primitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.750" end="00:47:29.670" style="s2"> because our brains are quite large, and those brains contain more connections at birth</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.670" end="00:47:34.970" style="s2"> than in the rest of your life, which is interesting. You actually die</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.970" end="00:47:39.500" style="s2"> to become a person. Because you don&#39;t make new connections so much</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.500" end="00:47:44.520" style="s2"> it&#39;s the connections you don&#39;t use that disappear. That is free</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.520" end="00:47:45.980" style="s2"> peculiar.</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.980" end="00:47:51.290" style="s2"> If you are a newborn, you don&#39;t have many capacities to trade</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.290" end="00:47:55.410" style="s2"> in the world. Your mouth works, your lips and your tongue, which is good</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.410" end="00:47:59.620" style="s2"> because you need breastfeeding, which is not easy.</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.620" end="00:48:03.830" style="s2"> You need understanding for that, and it is the first complex social interaction true</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.830" end="00:48:10.010" style="s2"> you participate in. You are born with some sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.010" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2"> functional networks, but the rest is hardly available.</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:20.120" style="s2"> You can&#39;t control your arms. When you look at a young baby in a crib,</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.120" end="00:48:24.150" style="s2"> and he is not wrapped up, his arms float around in space, and so are his legs.</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.150" end="00:48:27.460" style="s2"> And every now and then they hit themselves, and it usually seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.460" end="00:48:34.470" style="s2"> to be a shock to the baby. It is the periphery of the nervous system. Those elements of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.470" end="00:48:40.070" style="s2"> the central nervous system are not yet developed at birth. It&#39;s almost like the baby</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.070" end="00:48:45.620" style="s2"> must discover his limbs. It expands itself, from the center. He needs his limbs</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.620" end="00:48:50.070" style="s2"> discover, and figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.070" end="00:48:57.050" style="s2"> What Piaget was trying to do was describe the processes by which a child is himself</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.050" end="00:49:02.930" style="s2"> developed in the world. That has a biological basis, because you are born</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.930" end="00:49:08.870" style="s2"> with some available reflexes. And those reflexes are enough to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.870" end="00:49:16.010" style="s2"> to boot you. This is one way of understanding Piaget,</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.010" end="00:49:20.940" style="s2"> that I like. It simplifies things a bit too much, but it works. There are many different</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.940" end="00:49:25.420" style="s2"> ways to think about what the world consists of.</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.420" end="00:49:29.510" style="s2"> If you are a classic scientist, you tend to think that the world is made of matter.</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.510" end="00:49:34.210" style="s2"> And matter is made up of atoms, and atoms are made up of ... who knows</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.210" end="00:49:38.330" style="s2"> what atoms consist of, because when you look inside atoms,</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.330" end="00:49:42.280" style="s2"> you have no idea what&#39;s going on there. But we usually don&#39;t think there</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.280" end="00:49:47.150" style="s2"> about, and we assume a Newtonian reality, in which everything</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.150" end="00:49:51.050" style="s2"> is made up of hard little particles, like dust, and that&#39;s the scientific model.</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.050" end="00:49:56.830" style="s2"> But there are other ways of looking at the world that are not only equally valid,</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.830" end="00:50:01.550" style="s2"> but also just as necessary, and just as powerful. One is that you can see the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.550" end="00:50:07.510" style="s2"> as a matrix of information. And information generally has relevance</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.510" end="00:50:12.670" style="s2"> and meaning. At least, as we humans conceptualize information.</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.670" end="00:50:16.650" style="s2"> For example, if you are two years old and you crawl on the ground,</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.650" end="00:50:23.730" style="s2"> and the dog has a bone, you take it, and the dog bites you, that is informative.</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.730" end="00:50:31.180" style="s2"> Piaget stated that children come into the world with an &quot;information seeking&quot; structure,</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.180" end="00:50:38.440" style="s2"> and that when they act in the world, phenomena appear, which they can model with their bodies.</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.440" end="00:50:46.070" style="s2"> For example, if I am going to drink this, I have to model it with my hand before I</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.070" end="00:50:50.730" style="s2"> can do that. It turns out that if this thing is here,</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.730" end="00:50:57.310" style="s2"> especially when I&#39;m thirsty, and I&#39;m looking at it, my eyes get my hands ready to take it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.310" end="00:51:04.120" style="s2"> So when you say you understand something that means</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.120" end="00:51:10.620" style="s2"> that when you perceive it, you map it with your body. That happens on free</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.620" end="00:51:12.040" style="s2"> low levels of your nervous system.</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.040" end="00:51:17.750" style="s2"> For example, there are people who are blind. They say they are blind, they can</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.750" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2"> see nothing. But if you move your hands like that, and ask which hand</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:27.960" style="s2"> you hold up, they can indicate that, with an accuracy of almost one hundred percent.</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.960" end="00:51:32.830" style="s2"> You think, &quot;How is that possible? They are blind.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.830" end="00:51:38.520" style="s2"> That happens because your eyes detect patterns in the world, some of those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.520" end="00:51:45.780" style="s2"> perceive yourself as conscious reality, but other patterns are only mapped on your spinal cord,</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.780" end="00:51:49.690" style="s2"> or on your emotional system. You do not need to observe the object</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.690" end="00:51:52.850" style="s2"> to activate it. Because you probably think:</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.850" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2"> &quot;There is the world, you see it, you think about it, you evaluate it, and then you act.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t work that way, it rarely works that way. Partly because that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.000" end="00:52:06.410" style="s2"> is too slow. If you had to think about everything, you would be pedestrians incessantly</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.410" end="00:52:10.490" style="s2"> drive up. You have to be able to respond very quickly, and you do,</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.490" end="00:52:17.960" style="s2"> because your senses map things directly to your motor systems.</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.960" end="00:52:30.450" style="s2"> For Piaget, personality arises from</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.450" end="00:52:36.620" style="s2"> childhood, because the child encounters the world and integrates the information,</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.620" end="00:52:41.310" style="s2"> who collects it in that confrontation. They build themselves up</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.310" end="00:52:46.530" style="s2"> from their body, and the skills they practice with their body</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.530" end="00:52:50.510" style="s2"> like grabbing, pointing, scratching,</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.510" end="00:52:54.700" style="s2"> and all those things they can build. They build that up until they get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.700" end="00:53:00.210" style="s2"> where they can start using abstractions. The baby starts at zero, with its exploration,</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.210" end="00:53:05.080" style="s2"> absorbs information from the world, thus creating its personality.</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.080" end="00:53:08.910" style="s2"> It is a beautiful model, and we will discuss that a little further.</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.910" end="00:53:15.300" style="s2"> The depth psychologists. I mainly focus on Jung and Freud.</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.300" end="00:53:20.580" style="s2"> If you take a college of personality theory, Freud is usually introduced first,</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.580" end="00:53:24.420" style="s2"> and then Jung, and possibly Adler, and some neo-Freudians as one</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.420" end="00:53:32.780" style="s2"> further elaboration in Freud. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s appropriate.</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.780" end="00:53:41.450" style="s2"> I think you could argue that Jung ... that&#39;s the usefulness of Jung&#39;s theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.450" end="00:53:48.460" style="s2"> is very evident when it comes to the great similarities between people.</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.460" end="00:53:55.910" style="s2"> Jung was very biologically oriented. In a way, he was ahead</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.910" end="00:54:02.180" style="s2"> biological psychiatrists and psychologists. Because when Jung formulated his theories,</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.180" end="00:54:07.570" style="s2"> was one in the West, certainly in North America ... were most researchers</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.570" end="00:54:11.720" style="s2"> those people studied behaviorists. And behaviorists assumed you</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.720" end="00:54:16.840" style="s2"> was a blank page at birth, and that all you can do has been learned.</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.840" end="00:54:22.980" style="s2"> That is not true at all.</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.980" end="00:54:27.090" style="s2"> First, you cannot learn everything, because you must already know something</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.090" end="00:54:32.400" style="s2"> to start the process. And second, you don&#39;t really have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.400" end="00:54:36.610" style="s2"> learn what it means when a dog growls. That is, as it were, built-in.</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.610" end="00:54:40.740" style="s2"> And you don&#39;t have to learn to be afraid of the dark.</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.740" end="00:54:44.520" style="s2"> You can already do that on your third. There are many things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.520" end="00:54:48.340" style="s2"> built into humans. We don&#39;t know exactly what that means.</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.340" end="00:54:54.350" style="s2"> It seems that fear of snakes is innate, and even if it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.350" end="00:54:58.260" style="s2"> is not congenital (which it probably is), you can very quickly acquire a snake phobia.</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.260" end="00:55:02.900" style="s2"> While developing a gun phobia is very difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.900" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2"> Jung was very interested in what I think can best be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:13.330" style="s2"> the underlying structure of human cognition. Because people are a specific thing.</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.330" end="00:55:19.960" style="s2"> It is not that our soul is separate from our body, and that our knowledge is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.960" end="00:55:27.970" style="s2"> would be correct or universal. As if we could understand without a body.</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.970" end="00:55:34.300" style="s2"> That&#39;s not how we work. We are physical. Our brains are developed</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.300" end="00:55:39.790" style="s2"> for our body. Our mind is developed for our body, and so is our knowledge. That means that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.790" end="00:55:45.850" style="s2"> our cognitive abilities, our theories about the world, have underlying biological structures.</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.850" end="00:55:50.450" style="s2"> Those are assumptions for our knowledge that we don&#39;t need to learn.</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.450" end="00:55:55.010" style="s2"> You don&#39;t have to learn that being spanked hurts.</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.010" end="00:55:59.340" style="s2"> You just discover that. You don&#39;t have to learn what a smile means. You don&#39;t really have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.340" end="00:56:04.080" style="s2"> learn what anger means. You experience it. It is in you.</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.080" end="00:56:08.860" style="s2"> Look at little children, babies, when they cry they are often angry.</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.860" end="00:56:17.000" style="s2"> For example, a nine-month-old baby can roughly recognize its mother.</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.000" end="00:56:21.050" style="s2"> Someone walks into the nursery, looks at the baby, and that is not the mother.</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.050" end="00:56:24.710" style="s2"> And the baby starts to cry, and you think, &quot;Poor baby.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.710" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2"> That baby is not sad, that baby is angry. You can see that when you look at the baby</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:34.520" style="s2"> because he turns red, that&#39;s what happens to people when they cry because they are angry.</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.520" end="00:56:37.800" style="s2"> That&#39;s good to know if you&#39;re arguing with someone and they get upset</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.800" end="00:56:42.490" style="s2"> and starts to cry. You think, &quot;Oh poor one.&quot; But if you look closely</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.490" end="00:56:46.190" style="s2"> you can see that it is completely red. And that means he might want to strangle you, but</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.190" end="00:56:50.670" style="s2"> hopefully his social side will keep him from doing that. That can be your attitude</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.670" end="00:56:55.330" style="s2"> change towards him, or feel sorry for him when he feels hurt.</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.330" end="00:56:56.290" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:56.290" end="00:57:00.920" style="s2"> People have all kinds of universal things, and Jung was</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.920" end="00:57:05.550" style="s2"> very interested in what things they are, and how they manifest themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.550" end="00:57:13.530" style="s2"> behavioral patterns. Imagine you have an instinct such as anger.</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.530" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2"> That way you see it as a cross section, that person is angry.</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:21.030" style="s2"> You can imagine the matching facial expression.</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.030" end="00:57:25.890" style="s2"> But if you wanted to represent anger in a more complex way, you might represent it as a scenario,</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.890" end="00:57:32.850" style="s2"> a story. Because that&#39;s what you want to know when someone gets angry, right? &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.850" end="00:57:38.430" style="s2"> Imagine taking a thousand stories about angry people,</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.430" end="00:57:43.360" style="s2"> and which would compress into one story, so that all the common elements of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.360" end="00:57:48.010" style="s2"> all the stories of anger would be contained in one story. That would</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.010" end="00:57:53.410" style="s2"> be the archetypal story of anger. And everyone would recognize it cause it&#39;s anger</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.410" end="00:57:57.990" style="s2"> as in a movie, represented in its purest form. That&#39;s an archetype,</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.990" end="00:58:01.740" style="s2"> and Jung was very interested in understanding and documenting it.</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.740" end="00:58:05.800" style="s2"> And it is a lot of fun. One of the things we&#39;re going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.800" end="00:58:09.750" style="s2"> watching movies. Probably &quot;The Lion King,&quot; parts of it, and I will</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.750" end="00:58:14.520" style="s2"> show how the archetypal structure manifests itself. And it is worth it.</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.520" end="00:58:18.660" style="s2"> It&#39;s annoying because when you go to a movie you will think:</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.660" end="00:58:21.500" style="s2"> &quot;That&#39;s that archetypal structure,&quot; and &quot;That symbol means that.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.500" end="00:58:27.120" style="s2"> You will be very annoying to your friends. But it is very entertaining and very enlightening.</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.120" end="00:58:31.320" style="s2"> What&#39;s very cool about those archetypal story structures,</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.320" end="00:58:36.150" style="s2"> they not only tell you who you are, but in a sense who you should be.</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.150" end="00:58:37.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:58:37.160" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2"> That is cool. Because what modern people have problems with,</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:45.630" style="s2"> is trying to understand whether life has meaning or not. We watch the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.630" end="00:58:49.660" style="s2"> from a scientific perspective and say, &quot;Seems like all this</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.660" end="00:58:53.690" style="s2"> has no meaning. It has no universal meaning. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.690" end="00:58:59.960" style="s2"> I think that is a silly conclusion, because the designers of the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.960" end="00:59:06.570" style="s2"> excluded subjective meaning at the beginning of the theory development.</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.570" end="00:59:09.950" style="s2"> If you look at the world scientifically and say, &quot;There is no subjective meaning&quot; ...</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.950" end="00:59:14.670" style="s2"> Yes, of course, because science was designed to have all subjective meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.670" end="00:59:18.790" style="s2"> was removed from the phenomena. That is not a thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.790" end="00:59:23.020" style="s2"> to be surprised. Nor does that mean that there is no subjective meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.020" end="00:59:27.290" style="s2"> It just means that it is very difficult to grasp from a purely scientific perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.290" end="00:59:28.250" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:59:28.250" end="00:59:34.510" style="s2"> What&#39;s great about archetypal stories is that they put you on one</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.510" end="00:59:41.750" style="s2"> universal way of telling who you are. And that&#39;s really cool.</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.750" end="00:59:48.050" style="s2"> You also learn this at university. That&#39;s just to cry. You learn implicitly or explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.050" end="00:59:51.450" style="s2"> in almost all research areas,</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.450" end="00:59:57.030" style="s2"> especially in the human sciences, that morality is relative, and that there is no ultimate meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.030" end="01:00:02.390" style="s2"> Which is a really terrible thing to teach people your age.</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.390" end="01:00:06.920" style="s2"> Because you are too young to be nihilistic. You can be nihilistic when you&#39;re eighty-five</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.920" end="01:00:11.590" style="s2"> then you are already done. But being nihilistic now is a catastrophe.</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.590" end="01:00:16.910" style="s2"> It&#39;s pointless because the idea that things end up</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.910" end="01:00:25.130" style="s2"> being meaningless is an extraordinarily simplistic philosophical theory.</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.130" end="01:00:31.400" style="s2"> People do not benefit from that. It makes them sick. What you might consider is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.400" end="01:00:35.940" style="s2"> if your stupid theory is making you sick, that there might be something wrong with it.</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.940" end="01:00:43.090" style="s2"> That may be a criterion for the usefulness, and perhaps even the truth, of the theory.</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.090" end="01:00:48.130" style="s2"> It depends on how you look at things. You can say, &quot;If a truth makes you sick,</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.130" end="01:00:52.570" style="s2"> that doesn&#39;t make it false. ”Maybe. But maybe it means</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.570" end="01:00:57.240" style="s2"> that it is less true. That depends on what you mean by &quot;truth.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.240" end="01:00:58.850" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:00:58.850" end="01:01:04.780" style="s2"> Jung is very useful for that. He is a terrifying thinker.</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.780" end="01:01:11.530" style="s2"> When I was twenty-three or twenty-four, I had about everything for two years</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.530" end="01:01:16.660" style="s2"> from Jung, about twenty-three volumes. I was upset there.</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.660" end="01:01:22.360" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t understand what was going on. My dreams changed. It was intense.</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.360" end="01:01:26.940" style="s2"> At the same time I read Nietzsche, which is equally bad. Nietzsche said</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.940" end="01:01:30.550" style="s2"> that he philosophized with a hammer. That&#39;s great, unless he is</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.550" end="01:01:35.910" style="s2"> using that hammer on your skull is not very pleasant.</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.910" end="01:01:38.580" style="s2"> Jung is so different, and I think that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.580" end="01:01:42.600" style="s2"> never learn anything about him in college. If you don&#39;t understand him</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.600" end="01:01:46.040" style="s2"> he looks strange, and if you do understand him he is terrifying.</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.040" end="01:01:49.840" style="s2"> You will stop and think, &quot;Oh, never mind.</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.840" end="01:01:51.430" style="s2"> I don&#39;t really need to know. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.430" end="01:02:00.720" style="s2"> Freud. Freud is a nice piss for psychologists, which I find very sad,</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.720" end="01:02:05.020" style="s2"> because it is ungrateful. Freud was really the one</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.020" end="01:02:09.430" style="s2"> shaped the idea of ​​the unconscious. Everyone takes that for granted.</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.430" end="01:02:14.170" style="s2"> And that there is a cognitive unconscious, which the psychologists discovered in the 1980s.</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.170" end="01:02:17.840" style="s2"> &quot;There is a cognitive unconscious.&quot; &quot;Yes, good job guys.</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.840" end="01:02:23.150" style="s2"> They had already discovered that in 1910. &quot;But Freud is not recognized for it</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.150" end="01:02:26.950" style="s2"> that discovery if you look at experimental psychology.</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.950" end="01:02:29.450" style="s2"> As I said, that is quite ungrateful.</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.450" end="01:02:36.310" style="s2"> Freud is a strange case. You may have problems with, especially with details</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.310" end="01:02:40.430" style="s2"> from his theory. Like the Oedipus complex or penile envy, things like that.</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.430" end="01:02:47.000" style="s2"> They seem laughably anachronistic.</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.000" end="01:02:54.560" style="s2"> But sometimes someone can be mistaken in the details, and be right about the overall concept.</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.560" end="01:02:58.390" style="s2"> Because theories are layered. Sometimes I read an essay</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.390" end="01:03:03.700" style="s2"> of a student, and the sentences are awful. &quot;Where did this person</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.700" end="01:03:10.700" style="s2"> learn to write? ”“ Probably in high school somewhere. ”It&#39;s incomprehensible.</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.700" end="01:03:13.930" style="s2"> But when you read it all, you think, &quot;Yes, there is an idea in it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.930" end="01:03:17.750" style="s2"> The person is more intelligent than his writing skills. And then you can say:</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.750" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2"> &quot;You write crappy, but you&#39;re pretty smart,</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:25.750" style="s2"> and you have ideas, and if you could articulate them, they could be of high quality. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.750" end="01:03:29.720" style="s2"> You can be wrong about the details and right about the overall concept.</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.720" end="01:03:31.270" style="s2"> That was always the case with Freud.</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.270" end="01:03:45.450" style="s2"> And Freud is unsurpassed when it comes to pathological family relationships. From Freud&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.450" end="01:03:53.220" style="s2"> the basic task of the growing human being was to detach himself</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.220" end="01:03:57.480" style="s2"> of his family. Then you might think, &quot;Why is that such a problem?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.480" end="01:04:02.750" style="s2"> There are a number of reasons for this. Your parents are taking care of you, maybe you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.750" end="01:04:07.910" style="s2"> don&#39;t lose too quickly. Especially if they take very good care of you.</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.910" end="01:04:11.880" style="s2"> And that is the Oedipal situation from the Freudian perspective. The Oedipal situation arises</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.880" end="01:04:18.210" style="s2"> if you have one parent, or two parents, who do so much for you</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.210" end="01:04:23.350" style="s2"> then you are no longer able to do anything for yourself. And that&#39;s not a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.350" end="01:04:28.550" style="s2"> it is particularly pathological. There is no one quite as striking as Freud</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.550" end="01:04:32.300" style="s2"> who analyzes pathology. We&#39;re gonna watch a movie called &quot;Crumb,&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.300" end="01:04:36.520" style="s2"> which is a very disturbing movie. That is a warning to those of you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.520" end="01:04:41.490" style="s2"> who are sensitive to it. It&#39;s a very disturbing documentary,</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.490" end="01:04:46.970" style="s2"> but it shows Freudian psychopathology as you have never seen it before. Unless you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.970" end="01:04:49.330" style="s2"> a heavily Oedipal family lives.</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.330" end="01:04:54.710" style="s2"> Well, I was not able to go through the entire overview. I will tell you briefly</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.710" end="01:04:59.430" style="s2"> what is required of you, and we will continue with this in the next lesson.</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.430" end="01:05:05.060" style="s2"> There are three tests: two intermediate tests and a final test. It will be multiple choice.</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.060" end="01:05:08.680" style="s2"> I will make a number of questions available for the test so that you know what it will be like.</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.680" end="01:05:13.520" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think they are particularly difficult, although some might disagree.</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.520" end="01:05:18.200" style="s2"> We are expected to fit the numbers into a curve, remember that.</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.200" end="01:05:22.880" style="s2"> You must be aware of this. You must write a 750-word essay.</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:29.140" style="s2"> That&#39;s not very long, but that actually makes it even more difficult. The list for the topics</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.140" end="01:05:34.070" style="s2"> for the essay is on the website. You can register there. There are twenty different topics,</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.070" end="01:05:38.220" style="s2"> and fifteen places per topic. So I recommend that you do that quickly.</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.220" end="01:05:44.680" style="s2"> You have to make an analysis of your personality, which is 7.5 percent of your grade.</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.680" end="01:05:52.310" style="s2"> You can also find the link for this online. You can do that whenever you want.</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.310" end="01:05:58.000" style="s2"> Your assistant, one of them, is Christine Brophy. She&#39;s standing there in the corner</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.000" end="01:06:03.780" style="s2"> patiently waiting to be introduced. She works office hours, you can find that on the website. You can register</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.780" end="01:06:09.830" style="s2"> for her, online. You can also register for my office hours, online.</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.830" end="01:06:15.560" style="s2"> Well, that&#39;s half of the college outline. We&#39;ll see each other on Thursday.</p>
