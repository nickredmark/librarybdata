<p begin="00:00:02.040" end="00:00:06.569" style="s2">to be the first the first Apple but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.680" end="00:00:10.160" style="s2">got talking about it in the last last</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.569" end="00:00:12.660" style="s2">video having a production company</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.160" end="00:00:15.389" style="s2">step one who doesn&#39;t need a production</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">company it&#39;s not it&#39;s when we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">millions of members what a production</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">company that&#39;s able to rent out for</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:27.109" style="s2">cheap ie cost and maintenance film</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:29.070" style="s2">equipment and editing software for</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.109" end="00:00:31.109" style="s2">editing equipment I guess you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.070" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">if you could rent out editing software</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.109" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">but we can create it and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:39.750" style="s2">have it for free that so people are able</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:42.660" style="s2">to make movies and stories that move</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.750" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">them and so you aren&#39;t hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.660" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">means that there&#39;s more diversity in</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">film and movies and if we as parents</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">want more LGBT show us for our children</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:58.730" style="s2">but just have it in there because kids</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">are gay and kids have gay parents and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.730" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">it&#39;s ridiculous that most of the media</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">that&#39;s out there is like two-parent</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">households or no parent households which</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">is a little weird children unsupervised</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">seems to be a theme in children shows</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.040" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">and having single parents and aunts</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">raising them and grandparents or</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.560" end="00:01:20.180" style="s2">grandparent Tracy I&#39;m actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">happens more often in shows then is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.180" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">actually real life it&#39;s having diversity</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">of families and diversity of abilities</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">and having it done in a way hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:36.659" style="s2">that is good where the sent it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:38.329" style="s2">central theme is that they have two</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.659" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">mommies because who wants to watch that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.329" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">it&#39;s about you know it&#39;s paw Patrol but</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">not a big deal anymore than it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">deal to have a young girl you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">marrying a prince have a young princess</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">marrying Prince it&#39;s just commonplace if</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">you don&#39;t meet you know that the central</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">character is white just like that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:10.910" style="s2">central character is Asian or black or</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:10.910" style="s2">First Nations like telling the stories</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.820" end="00:02:22.990" style="s2">it&#39;s not even growing up I&#39;m white I was</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.990" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">pretend white I saw diversity as like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.250" end="00:02:34.390" style="s2">the Archie comics that Archie hat you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:37.690" style="s2">know had Betty and Veronica and so there</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.390" end="00:02:40.330" style="s2">was like a blondes and champions black</p>

<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">diversity there you go and I felt more</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">drawn to characters in shows it had red</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">curly hair like me and so I modeled</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:57.160" style="s2">myself after characters I think I mean</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.160" end="00:02:58.600" style="s2">then I just was drawn to those</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.090" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">characters</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.600" end="00:03:03.730" style="s2">how could you also look like me I don&#39;t</p>
