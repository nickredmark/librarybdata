<p begin="00:00:00.140" end="00:00:06.000" style="s2">hi I&#39;m evolutionary biologist brett</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.360" end="00:00:07.740" style="s2">weinstein my hope in this first video is</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:09.150" style="s2">to give you a sense of my intent for</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.740" end="00:00:09.929" style="s2">this channel so that you&#39;ll know what to</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.150" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen some speculation online about</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.570" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">whether or not the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">channel is to talk about politics or</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:18.770" style="s2">biology and I should take this</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">opportunity to clear that up I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.770" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">interested in what we call politics but</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">my belief is that it is also an</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">evolutionary dynamic and so while I will</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">not avoid the topic entirely I can say</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">that when we talk politics I will come</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:34.410" style="s2">at it from a biological perspective I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">also been asked who this channel is for</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.410" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">so let me tell you a few things about</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">that when I was in school I was not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">very good student and for the last 15</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">years I&#39;ve been teaching in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.600" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">think would have worked for me if I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:49.140" style="s2">encountered it that said I&#39;ve also had</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">many students who were successful in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.140" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">classic school context and they also did</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">well with my teaching style my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:57.210" style="s2">students are often the ones who come</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">through the door though thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.210" end="00:01:01.770" style="s2">they are not scientifically minded my</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">belief is that all people are born with</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.770" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">minds that natively do science and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:08.250" style="s2">modern schooling drives out that impulse</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:11.610" style="s2">by penalizing the asking of certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.250" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">kinds of questions I love questions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.610" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">the more difficult the better so if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">also like questions welcome what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">of topics will we address well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">going to spend some time on basic</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">evolutionary framework that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">the lens is to look through and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">tools with which to build up a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">scientific understanding we will spend</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">some time on fun questions why do males</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.900" style="s2">have nipples why are we take a look</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">those sorts of things there will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.900" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">important questions are human beings</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">evolutionarily monogamous or not there</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.299" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">will be difficult questions what is war</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">what is genocide what is oppression</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">where do they come from and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">evolutionarily speaking is there</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">anything that we can do about them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:57.450" style="s2">there will be speculative questions does</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">humanity have a future and if so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.450" end="00:02:02.610" style="s2">might it look like there are also</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">challenges for this channel my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.610" end="00:02:05.700" style="s2">thing about teaching has been close</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">interaction with students both in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:10.170" style="s2">classroom and in the field that allows</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">for an informal mode of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.170" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">accomplish over the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">that said I&#39;m sure we can figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">to do it and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here</p>
