<p begin="00:03:02.110" end="00:03:05.739" style="s2">people part of that conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.790" end="00:03:07.299" style="s2">that&#39;s the inspirational part so they</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.739" end="00:03:09.489" style="s2">want to do the break it down part by you</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.299" end="00:03:11.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t like actually make things on but</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">that isn&#39;t as enticing to people I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.110" end="00:03:17.680" style="s2">as like come one let&#39;s talk about game B</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:19.870" style="s2">right like the bigger proto peon thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.680" end="00:03:22.450" style="s2">that we&#39;re not in but we want to get in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.870" end="00:03:27.579" style="s2">and how does technology get us there and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.450" end="00:03:30.609" style="s2">only technology and what Tec can free us</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.579" end="00:03:33.819" style="s2">from the game a tech that&#39;s limiting us</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.609" end="00:03:35.410" style="s2">from going to game be like you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.819" end="00:03:39.790" style="s2">we&#39;re using a Facebook group to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.410" end="00:03:42.579" style="s2">game B and it&#39;s very it has some designs</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.790" end="00:03:46.180" style="s2">in it that are very game a that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.579" end="00:03:47.859" style="s2">push us down the game a path now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">saying we need to replace Facebook right</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.859" end="00:03:55.359" style="s2">now but but baby you know but the chance</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:57.190" style="s2">of ever played see it right away is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.359" end="00:03:59.709" style="s2">as like I need our own niche in creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.190" end="00:04:02.230" style="s2">something we want and then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.709" end="00:04:03.730" style="s2">eventually who wants Facebook doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.230" end="00:04:06.130" style="s2">exist if there&#39;s an alternative that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.730" end="00:04:09.430" style="s2">people is actually an attractor mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.130" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">not like naughty love with Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.430" end="00:04:13.660" style="s2">it is so interesting in game B that like</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:16.780" style="s2">I just saw a post on someone talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.660" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">about kind of the recent friction that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.780" end="00:04:20.650" style="s2">the group has been happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:24.090" style="s2">Facebook environment that some people</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.650" end="00:04:26.990" style="s2">were kind of leaning back towards video</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.090" end="00:04:29.690" style="s2">rather than written</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.990" end="00:04:34.010" style="s2">so that would be once again a place</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.690" end="00:04:36.229" style="s2">where we could use the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.010" end="00:04:38.180" style="s2">scheduling software because it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.229" end="00:04:42.410" style="s2">it&#39;s so much work to get a group of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.180" end="00:04:44.660" style="s2">people together and really it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.410" end="00:04:47.750" style="s2">that part of finding some time and for</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.660" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">people scheduled and and in helping them</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.750" end="00:04:53.720" style="s2">all agree to the time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">people question or whatever format it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.720" end="00:04:56.900" style="s2">that you were having an actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.350" style="s2">meaningful conversation around and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.900" end="00:05:01.820" style="s2">the scheduling piece and that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.350" end="00:05:04.910" style="s2">many discussion now I&#39;ve got it figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.820" end="00:05:06.350" style="s2">out like what what piece of that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.910" end="00:05:07.310" style="s2">who haven&#39;t necessarily been part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.350" end="00:05:08.690" style="s2">board because people have imparted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.310" end="00:05:11.060" style="s2">board meetings are being you and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.690" end="00:05:11.990" style="s2">people who have been not on camera and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.060" end="00:05:13.850" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think those people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.990" end="00:05:17.180" style="s2">want to come on camera all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.850" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">maybe though it&#39;s more other people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.180" end="00:05:19.669" style="s2">are like okay I can come and play at</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:23.180" style="s2">this and they may have never heard about</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.669" end="00:05:26.150" style="s2">it right and have anticipated so asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.180" end="00:05:29.300" style="s2">what I mean it can be fairly open maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.150" end="00:05:31.039" style="s2">it is you know how we how tech that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.300" end="00:05:33.710" style="s2">owned together it can help create game</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:35.479" style="s2">be it be interesting also if someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.710" end="00:05:39.530" style="s2">comes in to ask them what their thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.479" end="00:05:41.750" style="s2">is about funding like what in for each</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.530" end="00:05:43.940" style="s2">individual what would have to exist</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.750" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">before they would donate five or ten</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.940" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">dollars even if right now it&#39;s a token</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">if it&#39;s like you and me just doing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:56.300" style="s2">a month and it&#39;s ten dollars you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:58.849" style="s2">have nothing but what what would they</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.300" end="00:06:00.470" style="s2">have to I mean like is the idea enticing</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.849" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">enough that they would just chip in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.470" end="00:06:07.460" style="s2">little bit to help build momentum or</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:10.220" style="s2">would they need escape yeah is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.460" end="00:06:12.199" style="s2">something I have to do every week my</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.220" end="00:06:13.789" style="s2">question is like what would need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.199" end="00:06:15.979" style="s2">there before you would be willing to put</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.789" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">ten dollars a month in means like one</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.979" end="00:06:18.860" style="s2">we&#39;re not asking you to put in ten</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:20.300" style="s2">dollars a month but like what would</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.860" end="00:06:22.280" style="s2">actually need to be in place what would</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.300" end="00:06:23.930" style="s2">would value do you need to get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.280" end="00:06:26.360" style="s2">for that to be worth it for you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.930" end="00:06:29.539" style="s2">which also has that conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.360" end="00:06:30.949" style="s2">actual possible tech right like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.539" end="00:06:32.510" style="s2">know I&#39;ve no idea what it would be worth</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.949" end="00:06:33.860" style="s2">but it&#39;s not Facebook right well what</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.510" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">about Facebook that you do own that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.860" end="00:06:37.580" style="s2">see like is actually creating game B</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.189" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.580" end="00:06:41.720" style="s2">actually you get a say in it you got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.189" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">participate in and you got to have video</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.720" end="00:06:45.379" style="s2">conversations yeah I really like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">question and on that point just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.379" end="00:06:50.689" style="s2">technical note we were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.699" style="s2">challenge of having one of us have like</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.689" end="00:06:54.259" style="s2">or someone having to have a bank account</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.699" end="00:06:55.550" style="s2">or something with this money stored and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.259" end="00:06:57.740" style="s2">they have to worry about all that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.550" end="00:07:02.030" style="s2">turns out that they the open collective</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.740" end="00:07:04.669" style="s2">which is a website for open source</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.030" end="00:07:07.789" style="s2">software which we haven&#39;t discussed and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.669" end="00:07:11.300" style="s2">we kept that it&#39;s open that the software</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.789" end="00:07:13.460" style="s2">could be closed source but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.300" end="00:07:16.520" style="s2">a compelling reason to do that if it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.460" end="00:07:18.680" style="s2">open source they actually will manage</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.520" end="00:07:21.349" style="s2">the bank account and everything and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.680" end="00:07:25.490" style="s2">you just have a group of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.349" end="00:07:27.169" style="s2">allowed to approve expenses so right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.490" end="00:07:28.340" style="s2">you and I and then if a third person you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.169" end="00:07:31.909" style="s2">and I would have to give them permission</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.340" end="00:07:33.800" style="s2">to be the third person yeah yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.909" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">them to do it we would need a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.800" end="00:07:38.240" style="s2">likes on github which will be hard for</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:40.490" style="s2">us because we&#39;re not writing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.240" end="00:07:43.069" style="s2">software for developers which is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.490" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">normally github is we&#39;re writing this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.069" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">for consumers and they don&#39;t normally go</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">into github and hit alike so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.810" style="s2">challenge we&#39;d have to get a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:56.539" style="s2">likes likes or is that I feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.810" end="00:07:58.610" style="s2">know we know enough people who know</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.539" end="00:08:01.690" style="s2">github that like if they had five people</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.610" end="00:08:03.710" style="s2">like like it would actually like listen</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.690" end="00:08:06.770" style="s2">like it could be something I got</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.710" end="00:08:07.969" style="s2">tomorrow right is like yeah github we</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.770" end="00:08:12.229" style="s2">need to get a hundred likes people to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.969" end="00:08:14.120" style="s2">use their their software for finance so</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.229" end="00:08:15.979" style="s2">yeah they would have to go in and create</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.120" end="00:08:17.419" style="s2">an account and do that so yeah if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.979" end="00:08:20.089" style="s2">could find a hundred people willing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.419" end="00:08:21.889" style="s2">and that&#39;s really all it is is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.089" end="00:08:23.300" style="s2">gate for them to not have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.889" end="00:08:26.389" style="s2">until they get a set number of interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.300" end="00:08:28.129" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s fine since we&#39;ll be you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.389" end="00:08:32.300" style="s2">know since its kind of consumer driven</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.129" end="00:08:33.709" style="s2">but it will be or user driven I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.300" end="00:08:40.579" style="s2">know the correct term that doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.709" end="00:08:43.909" style="s2">like we&#39;re extracting people but I like</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.579" end="00:08:45.529" style="s2">that remember so yeah member yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.909" end="00:08:47.449" style="s2">think since we&#39;re kind of member focused</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.529" end="00:08:49.699" style="s2">rather than developer focused you know a</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.449" end="00:08:51.230" style="s2">little bit of we can play around the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.699" end="00:08:51.520" style="s2">edges I don&#39;t think anyone will scream</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.230" end="00:08:56.290" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.520" end="00:08:58.120" style="s2">for begging for likes and if they do</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.290" end="00:09:00.459" style="s2">then it&#39;s still for a good cause I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.120" end="00:09:06.130" style="s2">care all right what are they gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.459" end="00:09:08.500" style="s2">take away our ever yeah and I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.130" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2">several open source projects already so</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.500" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">you know at least arrow one person yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.050" end="00:09:16.450" style="s2">well yeah but but the main thing is you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:18.339" style="s2">know there is someone there is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.450" end="00:09:23.589" style="s2">developer involved so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.339" end="00:09:25.480" style="s2">people subverting the process yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.589" end="00:09:26.649" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s an idea is so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.480" end="00:09:28.120" style="s2">people come in and they&#39;re concerned</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.649" end="00:09:29.709" style="s2">about the funding we could say well our</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.120" end="00:09:33.730" style="s2">thought is maybe we&#39;d use this open</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.709" end="00:09:36.010" style="s2">collective as a as a way to manage the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.730" end="00:09:39.220" style="s2">funds which is always open and visible</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.010" end="00:09:40.750" style="s2">and you know so if you don&#39;t like how</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.220" end="00:09:42.430" style="s2">they&#39;re spending the funds you just</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.750" end="00:09:44.470" style="s2">don&#39;t put any more in and usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.430" end="00:09:48.100" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not people are putting</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.470" end="00:09:54.310" style="s2">and hopefully something that is not you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.100" end="00:09:56.110" style="s2">know not big for their finances I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.310" end="00:09:58.779" style="s2">ten dollars a month isn&#39;t nothing to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.110" end="00:10:00.190" style="s2">but at the same time I&#39;m not you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.779" end="00:10:02.680" style="s2">what I mean 30 years down the road I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.190" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">gonna be like how could I have done that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.680" end="00:10:05.800" style="s2">I was so stupid</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">right like that&#39;s not my kids that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.800" end="00:10:11.110" style="s2">anything like one X less extra olate if</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:14.079" style="s2">I treat myself during the month for</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.110" end="00:10:16.630" style="s2">eight or ten extra like a job yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.079" end="00:10:19.810" style="s2">i don&#39;t--it donated to your brother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.630" end="00:10:22.450" style="s2">patreon so that should be interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.810" end="00:10:24.760" style="s2">is in the same position as we are where</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.450" end="00:10:26.920" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to build the momentum but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.760" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">absolutely and there&#39;s so many people</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.920" end="00:10:31.050" style="s2">like I think that once we have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:33.220" style="s2">platforms to be able to kind of upvote</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.050" end="00:10:34.839" style="s2">important projects what it gives the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.220" end="00:10:36.730" style="s2">person or confidences is something they</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.839" end="00:10:39.730" style="s2">should be working on but like after</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.730" end="00:10:42.910" style="s2">talking to the Spartan guy as well I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.730" end="00:10:44.709" style="s2">like you need to be funded like this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.910" end="00:10:46.120" style="s2">something we want you working on and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.709" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">feel that way about a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.120" end="00:10:49.450" style="s2">this because other people aren&#39;t like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:52.300" style="s2">don&#39;t think I would find you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.450" end="00:10:54.190" style="s2">think there&#39;s enough like thing here</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.300" end="00:10:55.630" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough meat on for me to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.190" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">think this is a worthwhile project or I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.630" end="00:10:58.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;re the person not</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:01.810" style="s2">slightly gave me space just in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.750" end="00:11:03.220" style="s2">in general and but there&#39;s people where</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.810" end="00:11:04.570" style="s2">I&#39;m like if I had a million if I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.220" end="00:11:07.090" style="s2">millions of dollars I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.570" end="00:11:09.550" style="s2">like artist-in-residence like I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.090" end="00:11:12.280" style="s2">Science and Technology residents like</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.550" end="00:11:14.170" style="s2">this is where we want people focused and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.280" end="00:11:16.120" style="s2">it&#39;d be great if the people with money</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.170" end="00:11:18.250" style="s2">who might not hear about these things</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.120" end="00:11:20.050" style="s2">could maybe funnel that money based on</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.250" end="00:11:21.490" style="s2">interest right based on people like you</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.050" end="00:11:22.870" style="s2">and I who maybe have two bucks a month</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.490" end="00:11:25.690" style="s2">two bucks a week to spend on these</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.870" end="00:11:27.340" style="s2">things to be like no this is like how</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.690" end="00:11:28.780" style="s2">when Bernie Sanders gets money and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.340" end="00:11:30.460" style="s2">a bunch of money from different people</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.780" end="00:11:32.860" style="s2">that means something very different than</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.460" end="00:11:35.290" style="s2">a lot of money from a little right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.860" end="00:11:36.760" style="s2">and so if there you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.290" end="00:11:38.410" style="s2">somebody&#39;s making five thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.760" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">a month but it&#39;s art that&#39;s enough for</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.410" end="00:11:41.770" style="s2">most people live off of you know making</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:43.030" style="s2">five hundred dollars a month but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.770" end="00:11:44.740" style="s2">five hundred different people paying a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.030" end="00:11:46.030" style="s2">dollar you&#39;re gonna be more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.740" end="00:11:46.750" style="s2">give them a few thousand if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.030" end="00:11:51.700" style="s2">within your budget</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.750" end="00:11:54.490" style="s2">there those numbers make more sense we</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.700" end="00:11:57.820" style="s2">don&#39;t need to fund you of your yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.490" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">also one concept of often thought about</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.820" end="00:12:02.200" style="s2">is feature funding so when you want this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.040" end="00:12:04.210" style="s2">feature added to the main project or</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.200" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">this tool then you know you do a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.210" end="00:12:07.750" style="s2">crowdfunding for it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:11.850" style="s2">even as small as a little feature and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.750" end="00:12:14.290" style="s2">there are actually services that do that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.850" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">but you know we could we could do it</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.290" end="00:12:18.820" style="s2">throw up and collective or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:20.530" style="s2">yeah you would still need some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.820" end="00:12:23.170" style="s2">funding for general management to keep</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.530" end="00:12:24.580" style="s2">the machines on and there&#39;s security</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.170" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">breaks all the time that require</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.580" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">developer a couple hours to go in and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:30.670" style="s2">tweak things and keep things up to date</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:33.300" style="s2">so we have to figure out like if you do</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.670" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">that a certain percentage of every</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.300" end="00:12:38.050" style="s2">feature funding would have to have that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:40.900" style="s2">we&#39;d have to have people that are that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.050" end="00:12:43.900" style="s2">are doing a regular monthly for them for</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.900" end="00:12:45.370" style="s2">the maintenance budget but those are all</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.900" end="00:12:48.040" style="s2">things we can discuss when we get down</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.370" end="00:12:49.840" style="s2">to it if people if we have enough people</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.040" end="00:12:51.400" style="s2">giving $10 a month and we know what that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.840" end="00:12:53.620" style="s2">budget is like you and I were even just</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.400" end="00:12:55.270" style="s2">giving $10 a month that&#39;s $20 a month we</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.620" end="00:12:58.660" style="s2">know our budget is right that we can yep</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.270" end="00:13:00.430" style="s2">and that&#39;ll run the servers actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.660" end="00:13:02.860" style="s2">that&#39;ll run like several servers these</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.430" end="00:13:05.890" style="s2">days it&#39;s usually like five dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.860" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">month you can have something and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.890" end="00:13:09.940" style="s2">lots of free stuff most of my stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:12.970" style="s2">actually hosted on free on github and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.940" end="00:13:15.210" style="s2">then although for the database you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.970" end="00:13:17.160" style="s2">usually need some money</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.210" end="00:13:19.050" style="s2">it depends on how many people are using</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.160" end="00:13:22.470" style="s2">under a certain thing you could get it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.050" end="00:13:24.600" style="s2">free from from Google fire store which I</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.470" end="00:13:26.910" style="s2">use cuz it&#39;s easy but of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.600" end="00:13:28.950" style="s2">you know kind of close technology and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.910" end="00:13:32.760" style="s2">it&#39;s Google and you know we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.950" end="00:13:35.400" style="s2">to be funding a specific company so</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.760" end="00:13:39.450" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.400" end="00:13:43.020" style="s2">technology we can use and how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.450" end="00:13:45.390" style="s2">fund it but I have no problem if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.020" end="00:13:47.430" style="s2">cheap funding Google funding those</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.390" end="00:13:50.280" style="s2">places well we&#39;re creating the things</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.430" end="00:13:51.810" style="s2">that are like I&#39;d rather put 50 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.280" end="00:13:53.340" style="s2">towards something that Google owns that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.810" end="00:13:55.230" style="s2">gives us a thousand dollars worth of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.340" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">value then finding the mom-and-pop</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.230" end="00:13:58.680" style="s2">they&#39;d already in place or recreating it</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:00.270" style="s2">for ourselves when it&#39;s tens of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.680" end="00:14:01.620" style="s2">thousands like we need to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.270" end="00:14:02.910" style="s2">most bang for our buck and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.620" end="00:14:04.530" style="s2">things available for free</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.910" end="00:14:07.170" style="s2">we need to eventually get to the place</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.530" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">we&#39;re not relying on them but in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.170" end="00:14:10.140" style="s2">beginning if it&#39;s free and it&#39;s Google</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:12.600" style="s2">and Facebook</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.490" end="00:14:24.030" style="s2">and how we can create something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.900" end="00:14:27.420" style="s2">even better for our individual selves</p>
