<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:13.370" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.150" end="00:00:17.420" style="s2">what is the magellan course in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.370" end="00:00:21.420" style="s2">tutorial we are going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.420" end="00:00:23.640" style="s2">dialectical reasoning through the work</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">of gebser in his notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:30.689" style="s2">structures of consciousness in our last</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:33.510" style="s2">tutorial we talked about the magellan</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.689" end="00:00:37.829" style="s2">course be being interested in crossing a</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.510" end="00:00:43.760" style="s2">frontier and that frontier was between</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.829" end="00:00:47.809" style="s2">the current state where our reasoning is</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:53.270" style="s2">dialectical has a dialectical dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.809" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">into a potential situation which is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.270" end="00:00:59.010" style="s2">dialectical but represents a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:01:02.149" style="s2">thinking that is not dialectical and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.010" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">I think it is important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.149" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">the evolution of dialectical reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">reasoning how it came to be what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:15.060" style="s2">characterizes and accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">dialectical reasoning before we go on to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.060" end="00:01:21.950" style="s2">investigate the possibility of new types</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:24.500" style="s2">of consciousness and new structures of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.950" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">reasoning that do not operate</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.500" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">dialectically so we&#39;re going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:33.450" style="s2">this today in terms of gaps or</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">structures of consciousness and gap sirs</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">work the ever-present origin and in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">subsequent videos part three we&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">at dialectical reasoning through</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">developmental theory and in part four</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at dialectical reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">through the history of philosophy but</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:02.790" style="s2">for today we are going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:05.310" style="s2">dialectical reasoning through gap sirs</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.790" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">work from the ever-present</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">origin his book the ever-present origin</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">and this notion of the evolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:25.610" style="s2">structures of consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">I hope you enjoy this tutorial gebser</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.610" end="00:02:34.920" style="s2">saw the evolution of human consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:39.450" style="s2">as proceeding through great epochal</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.920" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">shifts and he uses that term epic so if</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.450" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">we imagine three waves or three great</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:53.640" style="s2">epochal shifts shifts ethics of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">consciousness and the way he saw these</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:03:04.620" style="s2">ethics arising were through phases so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">each epoch would have a phase in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.620" end="00:03:14.579" style="s2">phases would go from latent or the early</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:17.579" style="s2">days to efficient phase the height of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.579" end="00:03:19.889" style="s2">the maturity of the essence of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.579" end="00:03:28.230" style="s2">structure consciousness to a deficient</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.889" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">phase so we can think of this epoch here</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.230" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">between these two points as the epoch we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:42.090" style="s2">are in this epoch here as the epoch that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:45.060" style="s2">came before and so this you know just</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.090" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">before we start moving into our epoch</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.060" end="00:03:54.209" style="s2">our structure of consciousness today we</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:58.769" style="s2">would have come from the deficient stage</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.209" end="00:04:00.840" style="s2">for the previous epoch and moving out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.769" end="00:04:04.169" style="s2">our structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.840" end="00:04:07.790" style="s2">developing toward the new we move we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.169" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">see we&#39;re moving into a new latent stage</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.790" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">of the new structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.849" end="00:04:21.239" style="s2">now each of these structures of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.200" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">consciousness can be identified by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.239" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">types of reasoning that are evident</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">through works of art</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:33.780" style="s2">through philosophy through language</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:39.599" style="s2">through different cultural traditions</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.780" end="00:04:42.780" style="s2">and structures and so what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.599" end="00:04:47.060" style="s2">to look at today is the current</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.780" end="00:04:50.120" style="s2">structure of consciousness over the last</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.060" end="00:04:53.599" style="s2">2,000 years is called a mental structure</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.120" end="00:04:59.699" style="s2">the previous structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.599" end="00:05:02.750" style="s2">gaps are called the mythic structure not</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.699" end="00:05:05.849" style="s2">to be confused with the mythic level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.750" end="00:05:11.189" style="s2">development within the mental structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.849" end="00:05:13.969" style="s2">and the upcoming or the new structure of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.189" end="00:05:18.650" style="s2">consciousness gaps are called</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.969" end="00:05:22.289" style="s2">integral again not to be confused with</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.650" end="00:05:26.189" style="s2">the term integral in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.289" end="00:05:27.509" style="s2">developmental theory within the mental</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.189" end="00:05:29.430" style="s2">structure and we will look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.509" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">developmental theory within the mental</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:38.909" style="s2">structure in the next video so each of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:44.509" style="s2">these epochs each of structures of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.909" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">consciousness have a three phase kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.509" end="00:05:52.710" style="s2">evolutionary momentum within the mental</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2">structure of consciousness that we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.710" end="00:06:02.580" style="s2">in now delay in form of reasoning gaps</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.060" end="00:06:05.330" style="s2">are called OSI yannick the efficient</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.580" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">form of reasoning gaps are called</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.330" end="00:06:13.430" style="s2">pyramidal and we&#39;ll see why and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:16.430" style="s2">deficient form a reason gaps are called</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.430" end="00:06:16.430" style="s2">perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:25.339" style="s2">and in general gifts are left these the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:28.699" style="s2">detail of the integral structure blank</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.339" end="00:06:31.460" style="s2">and so this is the territory where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.699" end="00:06:33.889" style="s2">we&#39;re doing hypothetical work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.460" end="00:06:37.099" style="s2">trying to fill in the blanks in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.889" end="00:06:40.669" style="s2">territory and they magellan course but</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.099" end="00:06:45.589" style="s2">be consistent with some of the processes</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.669" end="00:06:48.740" style="s2">that gaps are described now another</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.589" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">thing in in terms of what we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.740" end="00:06:59.289" style="s2">at are these three types of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:07:07.610" style="s2">build up to what we understand as</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.289" end="00:07:10.490" style="s2">dialectical reasoning so the movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.610" end="00:07:13.879" style="s2">from the oceanic to the pyramidal to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.490" end="00:07:18.039" style="s2">perspectival is a development of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.879" end="00:07:18.039" style="s2">dialectical reasoning through history</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.249" end="00:07:31.459" style="s2">prior to this phase the mythic was was</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.300" end="00:07:35.649" style="s2">not yet dialectical and in fact even</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.459" end="00:07:41.180" style="s2">oceanic reasoning is not yet dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.649" end="00:07:42.559" style="s2">and so our hypothesis and this would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.180" end="00:07:47.779" style="s2">consistent with gebser</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.559" end="00:07:51.529" style="s2">is that beyond the epoch of the mental</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.779" end="00:07:57.129" style="s2">structure of consciousness the types of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.529" end="00:08:02.809" style="s2">reasoning would be no longer dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.129" end="00:08:07.430" style="s2">so that&#39;s the hypothesis that we go from</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.809" end="00:08:10.069" style="s2">the not yet dialectical epoch through</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.430" end="00:08:12.019" style="s2">this process of the development of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.069" end="00:08:15.800" style="s2">dialectical reasoning within this</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.019" end="00:08:18.169" style="s2">evolutionary epic to a shift an</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.800" end="00:08:20.300" style="s2">evolutionary shift to a new structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.169" end="00:08:23.449" style="s2">consciousness the interval consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.300" end="00:08:27.949" style="s2">trip structure of consciousness where it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.449" end="00:08:31.249" style="s2">is no longer dialectical and that would</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.949" end="00:08:32.779" style="s2">be the reasoning behind the magellan</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.249" end="00:08:36.169" style="s2">course trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.779" end="00:08:42.499" style="s2">look into this hypothetical territory to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.169" end="00:08:45.769" style="s2">give it more detail the way gebser has</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.499" end="00:08:50.319" style="s2">detailed the reasoning structures as</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.769" end="00:08:50.319" style="s2">they develop through the mental epoch</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.790" end="00:09:02.689" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s basically the grand over</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.629" end="00:09:09.249" style="s2">view so what we can do is parse out and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.689" end="00:09:13.819" style="s2">look at OSI Anik thinking for oceanic</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.249" end="00:09:15.220" style="s2">reasoning oceanic reasoning was not</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.819" end="00:09:19.309" style="s2">quite yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.220" end="00:09:22.999" style="s2">dialectical and it proceeds from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.309" end="00:09:25.339" style="s2">mythic and gaps are dismayed these</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.999" end="00:09:30.649" style="s2">distinguished distinctions the mythic</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.339" end="00:09:37.129" style="s2">he&#39;s called the mythic he called two</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.649" end="00:09:39.699" style="s2">dimensional and the characteristic of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.129" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">mythical this would be the mythic</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.699" end="00:09:48.129" style="s2">stepping back here the characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:48.129" style="s2">the mythical is that there was always a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.639" end="00:10:03.110" style="s2">return never a progression never never a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.660" end="00:10:06.199" style="s2">progression and so we see this in mythic</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.110" end="00:10:10.600" style="s2">cultures today our mythical systems so</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.199" end="00:10:13.790" style="s2">you have cycles seasonal cycles where</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.600" end="00:10:15.889" style="s2">they&#39;re spraying their summer or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.790" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">fall there&#39;s winter in their spring so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.889" end="00:10:25.429" style="s2">there&#39;s always a return a mandala like</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:29.300" style="s2">mentality there&#39;s a the temperance or</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.429" end="00:10:37.370" style="s2">the time frame is always cyclical or</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.300" end="00:10:45.100" style="s2">periodic Zeus flew around the heavens in</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.370" end="00:10:45.100" style="s2">a diurnal pattern there&#39;s tales of birth</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.130" end="00:10:54.690" style="s2">and rebirth in cyclical patterns like</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.690" end="00:11:07.510" style="s2">so the mythic had this two-dimensional</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.959" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">so if we look at Oceana Creason again</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.750" end="00:13:01.899" style="s2">just to back up mythic wheezing and had</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">this polar structure so if this was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.899" end="00:13:07.209" style="s2">beginning you reason you reason you come</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:10.779" style="s2">back there&#39;s always a return and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.209" end="00:13:14.170" style="s2">represented closure and the mythic style</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.779" end="00:13:16.750" style="s2">of reasoning it&#39;s two dimensional so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.170" end="00:13:23.670" style="s2">have two dimensional with the closure</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.750" end="00:13:28.740" style="s2">and gaps are called this polar reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.670" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">in this closure represented an</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.740" end="00:13:35.319" style="s2">evolutionary synth dynamics to move</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">toward new types of reasoning so we get</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.319" end="00:13:45.449" style="s2">to oceanic reasoning which gaps are</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:50.350" style="s2">called oceanic because it has wave-like</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.449" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">movements that have indications of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.350" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">progression but that eventually our</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:14:01.630" style="s2">recursive also return the way the polar</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:04.829" style="s2">reasoning does but in this gap Xerces</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.630" end="00:14:10.360" style="s2">the beginning of a movement away from</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.829" end="00:14:14.130" style="s2">polar reasoning and so for example in</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.360" end="00:14:21.779" style="s2">oceanic reasoning he uses a quote from</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.130" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">Heraclitus and the quote goes Souls</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.779" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">death becomes water water yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.580" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">becomes earth so there&#39;s a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.150" end="00:14:51.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a progression from one term to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:53.800" style="s2">the next and then a progression to</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.250" end="00:14:57.700" style="s2">another term this is the wave-like</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.800" end="00:15:10.020" style="s2">structure of oceanic but then the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.700" end="00:15:16.150" style="s2">this quote ends is from Earth water from</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.020" end="00:15:23.290" style="s2">water soul and so you see despite this</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.150" end="00:15:27.490" style="s2">progression there&#39;s a real ooping back</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.290" end="00:15:32.710" style="s2">to origin and so there is this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.490" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">oceanic thinking is the latent precursor</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.710" end="00:15:48.910" style="s2">of dialectical thinking for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:53.140" style="s2">efficient phase of the mental structure</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.910" end="00:15:56.470" style="s2">of consciousness and so we go from</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.140" end="00:15:59.260" style="s2">mythic which has got this closed two</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.470" end="00:16:02.710" style="s2">dimensional but closed reasoning cycle</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.260" end="00:16:06.360" style="s2">to oceanic with Gibbs which gives us</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.710" end="00:16:10.690" style="s2">some indication of this progression to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.360" end="00:16:15.490" style="s2">other terms relating the beginning term</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.690" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">to other terms but with the completion</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.490" end="00:16:21.160" style="s2">of the thought argument always going</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:24.340" style="s2">still going back to close on the origin</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.160" end="00:16:26.200" style="s2">still have as many valid like quality so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.340" end="00:16:29.140" style="s2">that&#39;s why he calls oceanic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.200" end="00:16:31.690" style="s2">late in its it shows signs of moving</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.140" end="00:16:35.010" style="s2">from polar reasoning in the mythic</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.690" end="00:16:40.810" style="s2">structure but it&#39;s not quite yeah as</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.010" end="00:16:45.420" style="s2">mature a dialectical process as the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.810" end="00:16:48.130" style="s2">phase that get gaps are identifies in</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.420" end="00:16:49.240" style="s2">the mental structure the development of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.130" end="00:16:52.330" style="s2">the mental structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.240" end="00:16:56.980" style="s2">into the efficient phase he calls that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.330" end="00:17:01.630" style="s2">thinking pyramidal so we go from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.980" end="00:17:05.380" style="s2">polar reasoning of a mythic structure to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.630" end="00:17:09.310" style="s2">the transitional things oceanic and its</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.380" end="00:17:14.200" style="s2">wave-like structure to the efficient</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.310" end="00:17:16.390" style="s2">phase the pyramidal which today we</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.200" end="00:17:18.870" style="s2">recognize as dialectical thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.390" end="00:17:22.660" style="s2">certainly gebser did also</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.870" end="00:17:26.440" style="s2">so now we&#39;ll turn to the efficient phase</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.660" end="00:17:37.540" style="s2">of the mental structure and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.440" end="00:17:44.740" style="s2">pyramidal thinking okay so we are going</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.540" end="00:17:48.460" style="s2">from the mythic to oceanic which is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.740" end="00:17:55.960" style="s2">first indication of dialectical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.460" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">- pyramidal thinking caps are called the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.960" end="00:18:00.490" style="s2">mythic two dimensional with its closure</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:03.960" style="s2">and he called pyramidal three</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.490" end="00:18:07.530" style="s2">dimensional in the reason why is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.960" end="00:18:11.110" style="s2">pyramidal thinking we won&#39;t be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.530" end="00:18:16.300" style="s2">looks like this can be illustrated like</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.110" end="00:18:20.230" style="s2">this you have a you have not a and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.300" end="00:18:31.290" style="s2">you have a progression to a higher</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.230" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">synthesis so here&#39;s the origin airy term</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.290" end="00:18:39.940" style="s2">it is contrasted with its opposite so at</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:42.570" style="s2">the far end so if this is summer this</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.940" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">would be winter and instead of having a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.570" end="00:18:56.260" style="s2">completion in this argument Baptist to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:19:00.210" style="s2">summer this tension this gap is held</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.260" end="00:19:03.850" style="s2">open in lieu of the search for a higher</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.210" end="00:19:05.789" style="s2">synthesis in this higher that synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.850" end="00:19:12.590" style="s2">gaps are talked about as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.789" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">third term for the tercio in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.590" end="00:19:21.479" style="s2">pyramidal or triangular structure is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:25.559" style="s2">what gives this type of reasoning the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.479" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">label pyramidal so now the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.559" end="00:19:35.460" style="s2">thing is that pyramidal thinking in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:41.099" style="s2">term dialectic comes from Plato and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.460" end="00:19:47.369" style="s2">uses the term diuresis and what diuresis</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.099" end="00:19:50.940" style="s2">means is separation and it refers to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.369" end="00:19:55.159" style="s2">ability for the mind to hold this gap</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.940" end="00:20:04.139" style="s2">this tension in this gap between</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.159" end="00:20:08.929" style="s2">antinomies or opposites in order to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.139" end="00:20:18.570" style="s2">force a higher synthesis in order to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.929" end="00:20:22.019" style="s2">gain a higher synthesis and so you see</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.570" end="00:20:28.559" style="s2">some of this in Plato and Socrates the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.019" end="00:20:33.749" style="s2">way Socrates would tease out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.559" end="00:20:37.169" style="s2">paradoxes and force people to move to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.749" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">higher level of thinking and this paved</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.169" end="00:20:44.759" style="s2">the way for all kinds of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:48.059" style="s2">advances in human history</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.759" end="00:20:53.279" style="s2">but this notion of being of diuresis of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.059" end="00:20:57.169" style="s2">being able to hold these antenna memes</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.279" end="00:21:00.929" style="s2">as opposites at the end of a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.169" end="00:21:03.889" style="s2">was a significant difference than what</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.929" end="00:21:07.559" style="s2">the mythic mind could do the mythic mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.889" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">would always see these categories as</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.559" end="00:21:12.029" style="s2">turning over on themselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:15.739" style="s2">MacDonald like fashion and just</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.029" end="00:21:15.739" style="s2">recapitulating themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.419" end="00:21:31.720" style="s2">what we then see in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.929" end="00:21:34.889" style="s2">dialectical reasoning amounts to after</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.720" end="00:21:40.980" style="s2">2,000 years of dialectical reasoning is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.889" end="00:21:45.460" style="s2">that you have this pyramidal thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.980" end="00:21:49.659" style="s2">that leads to a higher synthesis which</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.460" end="00:21:54.519" style="s2">then finds its antithesis if this leads</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.659" end="00:22:00.419" style="s2">to a higher level synthesis and after</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.419" end="00:22:10.389" style="s2">this very progressive or progression</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.169" end="00:22:33.220" style="s2">note that this concept of progress or</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.950" end="00:22:35.590" style="s2">progression is a product of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.220" end="00:22:38.529" style="s2">dialectical style of reasoning of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.330" end="00:26:53.230" style="s2">could see that this had already begun to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.970" end="00:26:56.890" style="s2">become deficient or we could say it had</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.230" end="00:27:04.660" style="s2">it started to exhaust its useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.890" end="00:27:08.230" style="s2">evolutionary usefulness as it moved into</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.660" end="00:27:10.690" style="s2">what he called the deficient stage and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.230" end="00:27:15.700" style="s2">he associates that with his term for</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.690" end="00:27:18.360" style="s2">that his perspective table now this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.700" end="00:27:21.640" style="s2">very interesting because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.360" end="00:27:25.260" style="s2">familiar with integral theory or aqua</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.640" end="00:27:29.250" style="s2">theory then the whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.260" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">perspective ilysm and Multan integral</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.250" end="00:27:35.950" style="s2">methodological pluralism and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:43.150" style="s2">multi-perspective ilysm is touted as the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.950" end="00:27:45.400" style="s2">pinnacle of rational development in but</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.150" end="00:27:50.110" style="s2">for the very same reasons that gebser</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.400" end="00:27:52.540" style="s2">saw what perspectival reasoning was he</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.110" end="00:27:56.180" style="s2">sees that he codifies this as the</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.180" end="00:28:06.490" style="s2">mental structure so there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:14.770" style="s2">complete disconnect between aqua theory</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.490" end="00:28:19.580" style="s2">and gassers notion of the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.770" end="00:28:24.470" style="s2">phase gebser saw the perspectival phase</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.580" end="00:28:29.630" style="s2">of reasoning in the mental structure as</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.470" end="00:28:34.190" style="s2">being deficient so this is a not a small</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.630" end="00:28:37.100" style="s2">point if you are a scholar of integral</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.190" end="00:28:42.160" style="s2">theory is aqua aqua version of integral</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.100" end="00:28:48.790" style="s2">theory so why did gaps or sea</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.160" end="00:28:48.790" style="s2">perspective ilysm as being deficient</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.330" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">well it&#39;s quite you know gap stirred</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.180" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">himself is quite complicated to read but</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">what I can summarize for you is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:13.010" style="s2">after 2000 years of this progressive</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:18.530" style="s2">movement to find the third term there</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.010" end="00:29:21.940" style="s2">are three major reasons why the pinnacle</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.530" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">of this which is prospective ilysm is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.940" end="00:29:33.140" style="s2">become deficient and number one is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:37.790" style="s2">that the perspectival ism is developed</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.140" end="00:29:47.720" style="s2">because of 2,000 years of meta</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.790" end="00:29:50.450" style="s2">theoretical division so you have higher</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.720" end="00:29:55.250" style="s2">in high the third term represents higher</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.450" end="00:30:00.560" style="s2">and higher levels of integration but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.250" end="00:30:04.360" style="s2">situation is so complexified and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.560" end="00:30:11.080" style="s2">driven by this notion of progress in</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.360" end="00:30:11.080" style="s2">higher higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:27.240" style="s2">that the that the there are no so there</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.160" end="00:30:31.020" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer and any solutions okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.240" end="00:30:33.660" style="s2">the solutions the inquiries become more</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.020" end="00:30:36.600" style="s2">and more abstract more and more meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.660" end="00:30:39.150" style="s2">theoretical more and more complexified</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.600" end="00:30:41.910" style="s2">they can&#39;t solve any it doesn&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.150" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">any more problems so in a sense it</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.910" end="00:30:49.260" style="s2">represents a closure so they&#39;re the meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:52.200" style="s2">frames that are required these are not</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.260" end="00:30:54.300" style="s2">get search terms itself represents the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.200" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">kind of closure because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.300" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">constantly moving to more and more</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:04.610" style="s2">complex higher abstract versions of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:10.740" style="s2">inquiry and so that&#39;s why he called this</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.610" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">phase deficient the second reason is</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.740" end="00:31:19.710" style="s2">because the meta frames these are not</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">his terms this is a synopsis they exit</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.710" end="00:31:26.660" style="s2">their own domain the domain of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:35.460" style="s2">so for example in Hargens and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.660" end="00:31:38.850" style="s2">Zimmerman&#39;s book integral ecology they</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.460" end="00:31:42.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a compendium of hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.850" end="00:31:47.280" style="s2">different approaches to ecology parsed</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.510" end="00:31:52.590" style="s2">out based upon altitude this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.280" end="00:31:54.570" style="s2">altitude worldview the who the what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.590" end="00:31:58.050" style="s2">where that it makes all these</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.570" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">perspective distinctions but when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.050" end="00:32:07.590" style="s2">read the book interval ecology it does</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:11.910" style="s2">not do ecology okay it does meta theory</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.590" end="00:32:18.750" style="s2">and so the problem with perspective</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.910" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">ilysm is that it it creates its own map</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.750" end="00:32:23.370" style="s2">territory confusion the map becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:26.970" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.370" end="00:32:30.450" style="s2">you&#39;re so concerned with the map in its</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.970" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">ever increasing complexity that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.450" end="00:32:37.410" style="s2">really kind of lost touch with being and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:41.130" style="s2">this is really the critique that gaps</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.410" end="00:32:46.440" style="s2">are has with perspective ilysm and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.130" end="00:32:50.790" style="s2">is that all these progressive shifts in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.440" end="00:32:55.920" style="s2">the pyramidal structure of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.790" end="00:33:00.630" style="s2">after two thousand years has created a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:33:06.660" style="s2">transit idea of transcendence as truth</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.630" end="00:33:11.570" style="s2">and has completely lost touch is made a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.660" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">gap this gap that&#39;s being held between</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.570" end="00:33:17.309" style="s2">has been iterated over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.120" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">again so now there&#39;s this complete gap</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.309" end="00:33:26.120" style="s2">between this transcendent abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:31.230" style="s2">and what he would call being or origin</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.120" end="00:33:34.230" style="s2">in that perspective ilysm and meta</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.230" end="00:33:37.620" style="s2">theory can no longer get at imminence</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.230" end="00:33:40.170" style="s2">and the basic fundamental ground of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.620" end="00:33:43.559" style="s2">being so this is really the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.170" end="00:33:49.130" style="s2">critique about perspective ilysm that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.559" end="00:33:53.340" style="s2">starts to be distracted by its own</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.130" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">abstractions and it no longer what gaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.340" end="00:34:03.260" style="s2">or can&#39;t uses the coins of term no</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:07.850" style="s2">longer a where&#39;s the truth in being and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.260" end="00:34:10.340" style="s2">so what was once in the pyramidal form</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.850" end="00:34:13.460" style="s2">efficient and evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.340" end="00:34:17.870" style="s2">advantageous has become in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.460" end="00:34:21.149" style="s2">perspectival form deficient and the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.870" end="00:34:24.270" style="s2">place I see this in aqua theory is when</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.149" end="00:34:27.450" style="s2">Wilbur says that aqua is a map of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.270" end="00:34:29.629" style="s2">prison and this really would resonate</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.450" end="00:34:34.020" style="s2">with gebser</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.629" end="00:34:37.020" style="s2">that perspectival ism is a great map but</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.020" end="00:34:41.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a map of the prison and the prison</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.300" end="00:35:01.290" style="s2">this represents what gaps would call the</p>
