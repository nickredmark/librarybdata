<p begin="00:00:21.910" end="00:00:26.329" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly a lot of stuff</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.150" end="00:00:38.089" style="s2">few months I think what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.489" end="00:00:40.480" style="s2">fundamentally is that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.089" end="00:00:43.790" style="s2">institutions we&#39;ve grown to rely on are</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.480" end="00:00:45.739" style="s2">much more similar to a dry forest in a</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.739" end="00:00:52.519" style="s2">fire then perhaps we were willing to</p>

<p begin="00:00:52.519" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">stand by my evaluation that the only</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.640" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">of this mess is to very very quickly</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.020" end="00:01:17.330" style="s2">it&#39;s actually been quite a while since</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.140" end="00:01:20.780" style="s2">we had a society that was really</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.330" end="00:01:24.170" style="s2">conducive to yes personal power and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.780" end="00:01:26.330" style="s2">personal ability to do things you know I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.170" end="00:01:28.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s often there is a desire for</p>

<p begin="00:01:28.910" end="00:01:33.380" style="s2">just never works even if we take the</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.380" end="00:01:37.790" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a communitarian or even</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.750" end="00:01:39.260" style="s2">communist approach right as you saw</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.790" end="00:01:41.860" style="s2">during the Bolshevik Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.260" end="00:01:43.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no revolution without Lenin and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.860" end="00:01:45.860" style="s2">perversely I think this might be one of</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.010" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">that there&#39;s no coordinating individuals</p>

<p begin="00:02:04.460" end="00:02:08.209" style="s2">say that the current protests are going</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.170" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">to have a very very limited impact on</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.209" end="00:02:10.489" style="s2">society some people might think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:11.810" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.489" end="00:02:13.819" style="s2">many people think that&#39;s quite bad</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.819" end="00:02:19.849" style="s2">address but the crucial thing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:22.010" style="s2">everyone in America that I know no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.849" end="00:02:24.409" style="s2">confused about what&#39;s happening everyone</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.409" end="00:02:27.739" style="s2">everyone knows how to protest in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.999" end="00:02:29.240" style="s2">civil-rights fashion and everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.739" end="00:02:32.210" style="s2">how to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.240" end="00:02:35.410" style="s2">a race riot well neither of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.210" end="00:02:38.060" style="s2">actually will change the American system</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.410" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2">right if they could all the change that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.060" end="00:02:40.940" style="s2">they could achieve has already been</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">achieved in fact was achieved in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.940" end="00:02:46.910" style="s2">1960s when the organizers of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:50.090" style="s2">protests were in a way you know both</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.910" end="00:02:52.010" style="s2">more violent and more pragmatic right</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:02:53.960" style="s2">Dee and her scope of action was open</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.010" end="00:02:55.550" style="s2">from you knows let&#39;s say Martin Luther</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.960" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">King who himself was somewhat ambiguous</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.550" end="00:03:00.650" style="s2">to say all the way to Malcolm X and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">more moderate people on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.650" end="00:03:07.340" style="s2">of King and this approach made that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">significant political faction in the</p>

<p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:39.820" style="s2">don&#39;t think even anyone on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:42.350" style="s2">believes that you know Joe Biden winning</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.820" end="00:03:45.110" style="s2">results in a restructuring of American</p>

<p begin="00:03:47.930" end="00:03:52.610" style="s2">and I think for people on the right they</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:54.370" style="s2">can&#39;t really believe the Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.610" end="00:03:57.020" style="s2">winning re-election fixes things either</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.950" end="00:04:11.810" style="s2">outcomes I think it&#39;s because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.530" end="00:04:14.150" style="s2">been very very thoroughly trained to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.810" end="00:04:17.450" style="s2">only do things that they already know to</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.790" end="00:04:24.200" style="s2">honestly match Hollywood movies if</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.210" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">because Hollywood is super realistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.770" end="00:04:36.170" style="s2">that&#39;s because I think we as citizens</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">have become super unrealistic we enjoy</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.919" end="00:07:45.439" style="s2">repair it might look like to see is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.099" end="00:07:48.919" style="s2">legit third-party or something like some</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.439" end="00:07:55.159" style="s2">alternative to the polarized extremes</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.919" end="00:07:59.409" style="s2">that are happening right now and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.159" end="00:08:01.309" style="s2">know for sure I mean it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.409" end="00:08:04.249" style="s2">problematic I&#39;m like a pretty</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.869" end="00:08:11.929" style="s2">democratic it&#39;s like very clear I also</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.469" end="00:08:13.639" style="s2">think that basically any party that</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.639" end="00:08:19.879" style="s2">like hopelessly morally bankrupt so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:22.729" style="s2">definitely think that one party is worse</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.879" end="00:08:24.649" style="s2">than the other but the narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.729" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of been fed my entire life as</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.649" end="00:08:31.999" style="s2">a young American is no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:35.979" style="s2">frustrated I am with the Democrats or</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.999" end="00:08:35.979" style="s2">the left they&#39;re the lesser of two evils</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.219" end="00:08:48.740" style="s2">for most of this situation like I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.860" end="00:08:51.430" style="s2">feeling really done with that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.740" end="00:08:53.959" style="s2">really looking for something different</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.430" end="00:08:55.819" style="s2">well what I would propose is that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.959" end="00:08:57.439" style="s2">system is essentially designed so</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.819" end="00:08:59.209" style="s2">electoral II it&#39;s very difficult to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.439" end="00:09:01.189" style="s2">a third party and of course you might</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.209" end="00:09:04.939" style="s2">ask like so why is the system designed</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.189" end="00:09:07.490" style="s2">that way and so on but I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.939" end="00:09:09.610" style="s2">core counterpoint this I would make is</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.490" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">that the next organized</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.610" end="00:09:14.680" style="s2">transformation of America will not look</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:16.300" style="s2">like a political party so I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.680" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">let could go back and forth and this and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.300" end="00:09:21.220" style="s2">listen to it but I note that say the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.910" end="00:09:24.700" style="s2">Democrats or the Republicans look much</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:26.829" style="s2">less like a political party now in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.700" end="00:09:29.709" style="s2">than they did in the year 2000 in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.829" end="00:09:32.290" style="s2">year 2000 right or 2001 if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.709" end="00:09:34.420" style="s2">pick 9/11 as the fissure point they look</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.290" end="00:09:37.209" style="s2">much less like political parties than</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.420" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">they did in 1991 in 1991 they look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.209" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">much less like political parties than</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:44.860" style="s2">they did in 1940 in what sense am I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:47.079" style="s2">using the term political party I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.860" end="00:09:50.079" style="s2">using in the sense of this political</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.079" end="00:09:52.750" style="s2">organization not yet in power that is in</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.079" end="00:09:56.370" style="s2">fact ready and willing to govern right I</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.750" end="00:09:59.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s this this political machine</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.370" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">first you know maybe pioneered in 19th</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.290" end="00:10:04.930" style="s2">century European democracies of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">political party slightly modified into</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.930" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">this revolutionary form by Vladimir</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">Lenin until you know have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:12.760" style="s2">revolutionary Vanguard party I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:14.290" style="s2">this machine has broken down and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.760" end="00:10:18.060" style="s2">it partially broke down because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.290" end="00:10:20.829" style="s2">system over time like you know it um I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.060" end="00:10:23.740" style="s2">think it was quite firmly locked down</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.829" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not really possible to vote the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.740" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">bums out like someone might say in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.610" style="s2">very popular way it&#39;s just not possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:32.350" style="s2">because the bums you can vote out are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.610" end="00:10:34.680" style="s2">just bums and they&#39;ve not been like near</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.350" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">the control panels in your lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.680" end="00:10:39.550" style="s2">right I think that&#39;s just you know there</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:40.899" style="s2">are some minor exceptions to this I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.550" end="00:10:43.000" style="s2">think the president you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.899" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">phrase I heard somewhere the president</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.000" end="00:10:47.110" style="s2">is the dictator of the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.820" style="s2">mayor of America right and there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.110" end="00:10:50.140" style="s2">issues if you try to invert that if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.820" end="00:10:52.120" style="s2">try to make them the mayor of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.140" end="00:10:55.899" style="s2">and the you know dictator of America</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.120" end="00:10:59.649" style="s2">that that probably doesn&#39;t work but</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.899" end="00:11:01.420" style="s2">these are the the coordination within</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.649" end="00:11:04.810" style="s2">the Democratic Party it was visibly</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.420" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">lower than it wasn&#39;t the 2000s and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.810" end="00:11:08.980" style="s2">Republican Party is visibly less</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.670" end="00:11:11.320" style="s2">coordinated and competent than it was in</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.980" end="00:11:12.730" style="s2">the 2000s right so we&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.320" end="00:11:14.949" style="s2">talking here I&#39;m not even talking good</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.730" end="00:11:17.470" style="s2">or evil not even talking objectives</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.949" end="00:11:18.970" style="s2">I&#39;m just looking at we are seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.470" end="00:11:20.589" style="s2">system that&#39;s locked in a two-party</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.970" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">configuration where the political</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.589" end="00:11:24.980" style="s2">parties are over time less and less</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:26.990" style="s2">politically powerful as organizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.980" end="00:11:29.060" style="s2">what&#39;s the democratic party line</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.990" end="00:11:31.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the Republican party line I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.060" end="00:11:34.760" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think anyone knows anymore</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.280" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">I think it&#39;s this weird miasma of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.760" end="00:11:40.490" style="s2">any sort of position and there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:42.050" style="s2">limited ability to get people within a</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.490" end="00:11:44.180" style="s2">single political party to work together</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.050" end="00:11:45.320" style="s2">which is what the political parties were</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.180" end="00:11:48.830" style="s2">at first right there were these</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.320" end="00:11:52.670" style="s2">mechanisms for for the creation of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.830" end="00:11:54.890" style="s2">governing structure so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.670" end="00:11:57.310" style="s2">next way American statesmen might work</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.890" end="00:11:59.810" style="s2">and that private citizens might work</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.310" end="00:12:03.020" style="s2">it&#39;s going to look not like a political</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.810" end="00:12:06.290" style="s2">party but it will be coordinated it will</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.020" end="00:12:10.070" style="s2">be public it will solicit public support</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.290" end="00:12:11.450" style="s2">and it will enter government and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.070" end="00:12:14.660" style="s2">question is how does that happen if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.450" end="00:12:16.670" style="s2">not it&#39;s not political hero propose that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.660" end="00:12:18.470" style="s2">at the very least one should consider</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.670" end="00:12:20.810" style="s2">the new conservatives now I think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.470" end="00:12:23.150" style="s2">new conservatives issued disastrous</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.810" end="00:12:25.670" style="s2">foreign policy but no one ever voted the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.150" end="00:12:27.530" style="s2">neoconservatives into power yet they did</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.670" end="00:12:29.690" style="s2">speak to the public and they did</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.530" end="00:12:31.790" style="s2">inter-government and they did have some</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.690" end="00:12:35.000" style="s2">limited support from parts of the public</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.790" end="00:12:37.790" style="s2">and what they managed to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.000" end="00:12:39.980" style="s2">really crazy way was you know achieve</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.790" end="00:12:41.990" style="s2">complete consensus between Democrats and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.980" end="00:12:44.420" style="s2">Republicans on the very important</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.990" end="00:12:46.430" style="s2">question of should we invade Iraq and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.420" end="00:12:48.890" style="s2">dozen other foreign policy questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.430" end="00:12:51.860" style="s2">arguably say the Ukraine crisis in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.890" end="00:12:54.770" style="s2">Obama years and you know the early Trump</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.860" end="00:12:57.710" style="s2">years was still basically handled in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.770" end="00:12:59.750" style="s2">line with their preferences so they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">world looking at building up the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.190" end="00:13:58.110" style="s2">as a space not just the market and the</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.110" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">you know strong neighborhoods this sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.209" end="00:14:07.110" style="s2">of thing and so you mentioned systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.160" end="00:14:09.000" style="s2">designers and I completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.110" end="00:14:11.010" style="s2">that the question is what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.000" end="00:14:13.260" style="s2">systems designers and so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.010" end="00:14:15.570" style="s2">how can we help these system designers</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.260" end="00:14:17.670" style="s2">whatever sorts were talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.570" end="00:14:22.230" style="s2">can we help them because they do exist</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.670" end="00:14:24.149" style="s2">to gain this political power well when</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.230" end="00:14:26.640" style="s2">we talk about system designers right I</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.149" end="00:14:29.190" style="s2">think we&#39;re either talking about profits</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.640" end="00:14:31.160" style="s2">oligarchs or statesmen and and of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.190" end="00:14:34.380" style="s2">three I&#39;m like most in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.160" end="00:14:36.810" style="s2">statesmen because here&#39;s here&#39;s a Batala</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.380" end="00:14:39.630" style="s2">glutens problem for example creator of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.810" end="00:14:42.300" style="s2">etherium if a theorem can possibly work</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.630" end="00:14:44.220" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna have to be an oligarch if</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.300" end="00:14:45.720" style="s2">etherium you know if he doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.220" end="00:14:49.110" style="s2">be an oligarch I think aetherium won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.720" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">work as the next currency there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.110" end="00:14:55.260" style="s2">vast reality that any system I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:58.140" style="s2">requires the exercise of power to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.260" end="00:14:59.880" style="s2">implemented I&#39;ve not seen any system be</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:02.190" style="s2">adopted without the exercise of power</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.880" end="00:15:04.529" style="s2">and if power is exercised in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.190" end="00:15:06.810" style="s2">coordinated way and that&#39;s the power in</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.529" end="00:15:08.970" style="s2">the hands of an individual right or a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.810" end="00:15:13.110" style="s2">small clique of individuals because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.970" end="00:15:14.370" style="s2">seen nothing else yeah but I guess comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.110" end="00:15:16.649" style="s2">to the implementation of full new</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.370" end="00:15:18.630" style="s2">systems right now the creation and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.649" end="00:15:20.130" style="s2">dreaming up of new systems that that can</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.630" end="00:15:23.430" style="s2">be done by others right you could have</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.130" end="00:15:25.649" style="s2">you could have someone develop very</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.430" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">extensive political theory or social</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.649" end="00:15:29.850" style="s2">theory or new ethical movement but then</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.589" style="s2">someone else would have to organize the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.850" end="00:15:33.420" style="s2">basis in that ethical movement and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.589" end="00:15:35.790" style="s2">person would invariably be powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.420" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">right so when I say profit right you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.790" end="00:15:43.290" style="s2">that can almost you know let me put this</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:45.029" style="s2">way I think that you know MLK for</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.290" end="00:15:47.819" style="s2">example was certainly using spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.029" end="00:15:49.510" style="s2">energy not just political energy and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.819" end="00:15:50.740" style="s2">think it&#39;s a mistake by say</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.510" end="00:15:52.270" style="s2">you know modern liberals or</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.740" end="00:15:53.800" style="s2">conservatives to ignore this I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.270" end="00:15:56.260" style="s2">modern conservatives want to ignore his</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.800" end="00:15:58.120" style="s2">his ties to communism and modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.260" end="00:16:00.550" style="s2">liberals won&#39;t ignore that how much the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.120" end="00:16:02.650" style="s2">theology of Christianity helped MLK</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.550" end="00:16:06.220" style="s2">achieve what he did right so I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.650" end="00:16:11.850" style="s2">consider him at least 10% profit or or</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.220" end="00:16:15.370" style="s2">preacher Reverend or whatever he was but</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.850" end="00:16:18.130" style="s2">this this this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.370" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">self-organizing system I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.130" end="00:16:23.290" style="s2">important but in the question is who is</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:24.940" style="s2">designing or building a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.290" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">system I think this is an act of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.940" end="00:16:30.250" style="s2">engineering and ultimately such a system</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">i transcend an individual designer in</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.250" end="00:16:34.030" style="s2">fact it must</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:38.230" style="s2">and it might transcend a small group of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.030" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">implementers it must but the the moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.230" end="00:16:43.090" style="s2">of its creation like that just has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:45.160" style="s2">done directly like there&#39;s this very</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.090" end="00:16:47.140" style="s2">interesting you know I know Machiavelli</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.160" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">has a bad reputation and as I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.140" end="00:16:51.610" style="s2">because his humor doesn&#39;t translate that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.590" style="s2">well from Italian to English like in</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.610" end="00:16:56.670" style="s2">English he&#39;s playful and almost her</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.590" end="00:16:59.350" style="s2">Kastigar sorry in Italian he&#39;s playful</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.670" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">sarcastic you know you can tell that he</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.350" end="00:17:04.060" style="s2">has moral principles in addition to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:05.920" style="s2">analysis but the most interesting line I</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.060" end="00:17:07.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s from the discourses right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.920" end="00:17:10.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not from the prints that I ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.720" end="00:17:14.230" style="s2">read was you know a new political system</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.780" end="00:17:16.750" style="s2">be it a principality or Republic is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.230" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">always the work of a single man I found</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.750" end="00:17:21.310" style="s2">that deeply insightful right in a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:22.780" style="s2">important way you know maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.310" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">American Revolution we would consider</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.780" end="00:17:27.430" style="s2">George Washington to be that person or</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">you know maybe someone like Hamilton or</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.430" end="00:17:34.270" style="s2">whatever but you know they had a choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">point as to what kind of system to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.270" end="00:17:38.470" style="s2">contribute their energies to so in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:40.630" style="s2">moment it was their decision it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.470" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">the decision of the American people they</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.630" end="00:17:45.150" style="s2">put it we the people but who is this we</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:47.560" style="s2">the people who is this we the market</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.150" end="00:17:49.720" style="s2">whose hand is the invisible hand that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.560" end="00:17:52.030" style="s2">moves the market right and who who is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.720" end="00:17:53.590" style="s2">the person who gets to say we it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.030" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">said by a 300 million people</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.590" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">simultaneously someone is speaking right</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:03.049" style="s2">so that will kind of be my my push back</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:05.989" style="s2">I would say yes it&#39;s good to mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.049" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">Commons but I think the Commons can only</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.989" end="00:18:12.860" style="s2">be shepherded administered extended</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:15.409" style="s2">rebuilt through the work of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.860" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">and the process of building them if only</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.409" end="00:18:24.169" style="s2">for a short time those individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:29.749" style="s2">become immensely powerful quote perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.169" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">next question James yeah this one well</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.749" end="00:18:35.059" style="s2">hey there&#39;s a lot of like like you said</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:37.609" style="s2">what might what comes next might not</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.059" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">look like a political party which I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.609" end="00:18:40.489" style="s2">think ties into this question because</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:43.489" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of attention in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.489" end="00:18:46.879" style="s2">discussions like this around national</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.489" end="00:18:48.340" style="s2">politics the presidency who&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.879" end="00:18:50.509" style="s2">the president and what party&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.340" end="00:18:53.929" style="s2">control of the house control of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.509" end="00:18:55.759" style="s2">Senate but it seems like a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.929" end="00:18:58.220" style="s2">like decisions on the ground are being</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.759" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">made in local governance and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.220" end="00:19:02.809" style="s2">time in local governance the political</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">parties of the individual members</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.809" end="00:19:07.249" style="s2">matters much much less than or holds</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:10.309" style="s2">much less sway than in a lot of national</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.249" end="00:19:11.899" style="s2">politics where you have a Council of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.309" end="00:19:14.690" style="s2">five people that are all you know they</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.899" end="00:19:16.999" style="s2">all live in this small town and and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.690" end="00:19:19.909" style="s2">party holds less way there&#39;s less toeing</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.999" end="00:19:23.779" style="s2">the line there may be so I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.909" end="00:19:27.230" style="s2">what your thoughts on our thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.779" end="00:19:32.529" style="s2">local governance and what nationally</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.230" end="00:19:32.529" style="s2">organized local politicians looks like I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.639" end="00:19:39.739" style="s2">think the national organization aspect</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.639" end="00:19:48.679" style="s2">right like it&#39;s sort of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.739" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s um I think there&#39;s a I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.679" end="00:19:53.690" style="s2">the local politics aspect would matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:56.419" style="s2">immensely if people tracked local</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.690" end="00:19:58.279" style="s2">material reality and people still were</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.419" end="00:20:01.100" style="s2">invested in their local social community</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.279" end="00:20:03.859" style="s2">rather than existing as much as they do</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.100" end="00:20:07.570" style="s2">on the symbolic level so perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.859" end="00:20:10.970" style="s2">first thing to consider is that a return</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.570" end="00:20:14.200" style="s2">to the local reality that&#39;s under their</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.970" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">control that might be very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.200" end="00:20:23.210" style="s2">and then what might this</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:25.790" style="s2">like I think it would have to be through</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.210" end="00:20:28.420" style="s2">a fragmentation of media I just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.790" end="00:20:32.270" style="s2">see them I just can&#39;t see people ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.420" end="00:20:34.780" style="s2">unglue in their eyes from the screen</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.270" end="00:20:36.920" style="s2">right stopping to read newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.780" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">ceasing to consume mass-produced</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.920" end="00:20:42.200" style="s2">entertainment so I think they&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:43.940" style="s2">consuming entertainment and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.200" end="00:20:46.520" style="s2">entertainment shakes them and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.940" end="00:20:48.740" style="s2">they on a subconscious level act</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.520" end="00:20:51.620" style="s2">primarily on the entertainment rather</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.740" end="00:20:53.450" style="s2">than the reality and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.620" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">entertainment is always get kept one way</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.450" end="00:21:01.460" style="s2">or another so free free fragmentation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:03.860" style="s2">media followed by essentially this</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.460" end="00:21:05.920" style="s2">strong focus on at least local symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.860" end="00:21:08.330" style="s2">action that builds up power centers</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.920" end="00:21:09.680" style="s2">because the key thing is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.330" end="00:21:13.940" style="s2">the key trick that I think is often</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.680" end="00:21:16.970" style="s2">played is we are against power so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.940" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">removing all visible power and if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.970" end="00:21:20.390" style="s2">remove our all visible power then the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:22.460" style="s2">only power that exists in the system is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.390" end="00:21:24.680" style="s2">the invisible or hyper centralized power</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.460" end="00:21:26.900" style="s2">right so you actually get a super</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.680" end="00:21:28.400" style="s2">centralized society that nominally you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.900" end="00:21:31.040" style="s2">know everyone is equal</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:33.470" style="s2">but Augustus is first citizen right or</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.040" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">Napoleon is first citizen everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.470" end="00:21:37.130" style="s2">equal but comrade Stalin&#39;s like a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:39.770" style="s2">bit more equal than everyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t really remove Comrade Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.770" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">by calling out your other comrades is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:45.770" style="s2">problematic in fact if you&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:47.960" style="s2">out your other comrades is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.770" end="00:21:50.510" style="s2">you&#39;re definitely helping Stalin right</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.960" end="00:21:52.460" style="s2">like he&#39;s definitely acting a-list so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.510" end="00:21:55.250" style="s2">this is like a very totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.460" end="00:21:57.110" style="s2">metaphor but we see a non totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.250" end="00:21:59.900" style="s2">societal equivalent of this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.110" end="00:22:02.870" style="s2">like beige gray consensus of new</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.900" end="00:22:05.990" style="s2">liberalism that is now you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.870" end="00:22:11.480" style="s2">it&#39;s basically defeated right like and</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.990" end="00:22:15.260" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure what happens next but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.480" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">next thing is by default still going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.260" end="00:22:21.080" style="s2">be super scaled in the media landscape</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">so okay without scaling back the media</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.080" end="00:22:25.820" style="s2">landscape to smaller projects and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:29.990" style="s2">smaller packages of consumption and less</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.820" end="00:22:32.510" style="s2">bundled media consumers I just can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.990" end="00:22:34.550" style="s2">people caring about local action even</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.510" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">though it in theory should influence</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.550" end="00:22:41.870" style="s2">them so much maybe a follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:45.770" style="s2">James does that feel like it touches on</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.870" end="00:22:47.660" style="s2">on the topic uh yeah I think you touched</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.770" end="00:22:51.740" style="s2">on the topic it seems very much related</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.660" end="00:22:53.630" style="s2">to kind of the you know you know back</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.740" end="00:22:55.070" style="s2">back back to the back to the land</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.630" end="00:22:56.990" style="s2">movement that we&#39;re that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.070" end="00:22:59.809" style="s2">from a lot of hearing from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.990" end="00:23:02.780" style="s2">different sides of folks this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.809" end="00:23:04.700" style="s2">hyperlocal you know let&#39;s step out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.780" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">this broken system and build a little</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.700" end="00:23:10.820" style="s2">pocket of you know patchwork utopia is</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:14.210" style="s2">it&#39;s it seems quite related because</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.820" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">that&#39;s another that&#39;s a form of local</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.210" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">governance and that&#39;s an extreme of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:22.040" style="s2">breaking that media landscape as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:23.480" style="s2">said let&#39;s cut off let&#39;s you know really</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.040" end="00:23:26.210" style="s2">separate ourselves not from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.480" end="00:23:29.140" style="s2">electrical grid but from the social grid</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.210" end="00:23:33.350" style="s2">and and really look right where we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.140" end="00:23:35.240" style="s2">and that seems like you said that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.350" end="00:23:36.800" style="s2">centralizes power because you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.240" end="00:23:38.840" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively cutting off</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.800" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">any voices that go off into their pocket</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.840" end="00:23:43.730" style="s2">from from the state that must still</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:46.210" style="s2">exist as controlling whatever land your</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.730" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">pocket lives on that sort of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.210" end="00:23:59.030" style="s2">I&#39;d be interested to hear media</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:24:01.490" style="s2">fragmentation trends and or efforts that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.030" end="00:24:03.650" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen or that have excited you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.490" end="00:24:05.720" style="s2">about the you know if it media</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.650" end="00:24:08.059" style="s2">fragmentation is what you think brings</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.720" end="00:24:11.750" style="s2">local politics back into a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.059" end="00:24:15.429" style="s2">place like is that happening you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.750" end="00:24:19.160" style="s2">you see it happening any hope of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.429" end="00:24:22.700" style="s2">not by default I&#39;m not seeing you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.160" end="00:24:26.450" style="s2">think it&#39;s the nature it&#39;s the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.700" end="00:24:29.059" style="s2">these networked spaces that you never</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.450" end="00:24:32.510" style="s2">exit them right no one wants to leave a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.059" end="00:24:35.710" style="s2">corner of the media space that they you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.510" end="00:24:38.270" style="s2">know that they feel is impaired to them</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.710" end="00:24:41.510" style="s2">to go somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.270" end="00:24:43.160" style="s2">what they primarily want to do is stay</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.510" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">and talk to the other people even if</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.160" end="00:24:46.070" style="s2">they consider them</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:49.670" style="s2">enemies right so humans are like super</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.070" end="00:24:52.220" style="s2">agglomerative the closest I&#39;ve seen is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.670" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">this almost subcultural differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.220" end="00:24:56.510" style="s2">where you might see corners of Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.420" style="s2">or corner corners of YouTube they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.510" end="00:25:01.460" style="s2">just completely mutually unintelligible</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.420" end="00:25:04.280" style="s2">right so the sort of sequestration</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.460" end="00:25:09.740" style="s2">through obscurity through subcultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.280" end="00:25:11.870" style="s2">idiom through tiny boutique writers or</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.740" end="00:25:14.300" style="s2">thinkers you know various kind of groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.870" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">with a cult following if you thought if</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.300" end="00:25:17.750" style="s2">you said if you think about it like</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:20.030" style="s2">these these cult followings that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.750" end="00:25:22.670" style="s2">honestly like very much countercultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.030" end="00:25:24.500" style="s2">they don&#39;t want the Normie to come they</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.670" end="00:25:26.810" style="s2">don&#39;t want the normal person to come in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.500" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">they actually want to keep it small and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.810" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">exclusive and I think they prefer it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:34.460" style="s2">that way so some of those groups will</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:38.510" style="s2">remain stable though I wonder you know I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.460" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">think pseudonymity is is losing very</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.510" end="00:25:45.710" style="s2">badly right the internet was basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:49.850" style="s2">pseudonymous by default in 2005 possibly</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.710" end="00:25:51.830" style="s2">as late as 2010 but by 2012 definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.850" end="00:25:53.390" style="s2">you know the normal respectable thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.830" end="00:25:57.530" style="s2">was to speak on the internet with your</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.390" end="00:25:59.060" style="s2">own name and your own face and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.530" end="00:26:00.770" style="s2">subcultures can still develop in</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.060" end="00:26:03.680" style="s2">interesting ways as you might see on</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.770" end="00:26:05.650" style="s2">various Twitter accounts but I think at</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.680" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">this point we&#39;re almost suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.650" end="00:26:13.400" style="s2">the of the you know unnamed masked user</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:16.040" style="s2">we want their name perhaps perhaps yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.400" end="00:26:19.040" style="s2">you know strong idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.040" end="00:26:20.930" style="s2">subcultures with like reputation systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.040" end="00:26:24.500" style="s2">baked into rooted to identity seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.930" end="00:26:28.490" style="s2">required for like real like long term</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.500" end="00:26:30.590" style="s2">building as a group yeah this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.490" end="00:26:32.570" style="s2">certainly true but note this also makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.590" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">them legible and susceptible to economic</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.570" end="00:26:37.070" style="s2">pressure right yeah if I can jump in for</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:41.390" style="s2">a sec just a very quick observation I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.070" end="00:26:43.660" style="s2">actually done a bunch of research on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.390" end="00:26:46.370" style="s2">Internet and there&#39;s no evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.660" end="00:26:50.420" style="s2">sorry the Sun here is weird there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.370" end="00:26:52.850" style="s2">evidence that requiring real name usage</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.420" end="00:26:55.899" style="s2">improves politeness of conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.850" end="00:26:58.489" style="s2">like any of the other stuff that people</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.899" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">that&#39;s very important many of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.489" end="00:27:04.519" style="s2">backers of those policies are companies</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:07.100" style="s2">like Facebook which benefit in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.519" end="00:27:10.009" style="s2">from people being required to use real</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.100" end="00:27:11.389" style="s2">names for whatever reason um I can draw</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.009" end="00:27:12.679" style="s2">up an article that I wrote about this in</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.389" end="00:27:16.070" style="s2">the chat but I just think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.679" end="00:27:18.309" style="s2">exhuming of the third point is usually</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.070" end="00:27:20.629" style="s2">not acknowledged in these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.309" end="00:27:22.970" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s really interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.629" end="00:27:23.539" style="s2">my quality of conversation kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.970" end="00:27:26.119" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about right like</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.539" end="00:27:28.429" style="s2">politeness and and like civil civility</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.119" end="00:27:31.789" style="s2">of conversation I wonder how it affects</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.429" end="00:27:33.499" style="s2">the ability to affect material change as</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.789" end="00:27:37.820" style="s2">I could organize group of people though</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.499" end="00:27:40.879" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s yeah I wonder that as</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.820" end="00:27:44.899" style="s2">opposed to just like conversational</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.879" end="00:27:46.820" style="s2">quality I think the the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.899" end="00:27:48.980" style="s2">black lists for hiring is super</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.659" end="00:29:11.450" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.140" end="00:29:12.950" style="s2">still a lot of interesting work a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.730" end="00:29:29.810" style="s2">explain um the difference is you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.010" end="00:29:32.930" style="s2">have some of this extremely intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.810" end="00:29:34.850" style="s2">that is like you know really focuses</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.930" end="00:29:36.800" style="s2">very heavily does a lot of thinking does</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.850" end="00:29:39.080" style="s2">a lot of research but what they choose</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.800" end="00:29:40.670" style="s2">to think about a research right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.080" end="00:29:42.830" style="s2">later what they choose to manage what</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.670" end="00:29:44.330" style="s2">they choose to give money into is</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.830" end="00:29:46.970" style="s2">something that exists in this shared</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.330" end="00:29:49.460" style="s2">symbolic reality rather than something</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.970" end="00:29:51.800" style="s2">that&#39;s like local and concrete I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.460" end="00:29:54.290" style="s2">for many people it is distraction but</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.800" end="00:29:57.110" style="s2">I&#39;m not positing distraction as such I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.290" end="00:29:59.650" style="s2">positing like this orientation to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.110" end="00:30:02.240" style="s2">causal action almost right so a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.650" end="00:30:03.350" style="s2">different frame I could put on it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.240" end="00:30:06.620" style="s2">then I&#39;ll let you finish your question</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.350" end="00:30:09.860" style="s2">if it still applies is imagine extremely</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.620" end="00:30:11.420" style="s2">severe brain drain where the smartest</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.860" end="00:30:14.510" style="s2">local organizer in every village</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.420" end="00:30:16.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily all go to New</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.510" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">York but they all mentally direct their</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.280" end="00:30:22.340" style="s2">energy to what&#39;s happening in New York</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:25.130" style="s2">right there virtually brain drained if</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.340" end="00:30:27.170" style="s2">that makes sense sure yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.130" end="00:30:30.260" style="s2">question still applies which is that if</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.170" end="00:30:33.050" style="s2">there&#39;s real power to be had on a local</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.260" end="00:30:34.760" style="s2">level that seems to imply that any small</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.050" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">number of people and a group that can</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.760" end="00:30:39.290" style="s2">coordinate to work on local politics</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:40.940" style="s2">maybe create a narrative in which local</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.290" end="00:30:42.170" style="s2">politics is symbolically meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.940" end="00:30:46.700" style="s2">them that might be a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.170" end="00:30:48.560" style="s2">groundwork then you know I emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.700" end="00:30:50.840" style="s2">again what does the machinery of local</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.560" end="00:30:52.340" style="s2">politics look like it you know to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.840" end="00:30:54.650" style="s2">fair running for mayor maybe isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.340" end="00:30:56.390" style="s2">terrible but it&#39;s like you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.650" end="00:30:58.300" style="s2">the the most powerful person in central</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.390" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">disco isn&#39;t the mayor of San Francisco</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.300" end="00:31:05.660" style="s2">right sure but if you&#39;re positing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.590" end="00:31:06.980" style="s2">there&#39;s brain drain to national politics</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.660" end="00:31:09.710" style="s2">where there&#39;s very little leverage and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.980" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">then people are ignoring politics on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.710" end="00:31:13.400" style="s2">local level which perhaps they have more</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:16.040" style="s2">leverage and that seems to imply that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.400" end="00:31:17.630" style="s2">there&#39;s you know ten million hundred</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.040" end="00:31:19.190" style="s2">million dollar bills lying on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.630" end="00:31:21.950" style="s2">sidewalk for anybody who can do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.190" end="00:31:22.809" style="s2">sort of local entrepreneurship I very</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.950" end="00:31:25.490" style="s2">much think there</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.809" end="00:31:28.070" style="s2">now for most towns it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.490" end="00:31:31.010" style="s2">hungry million right but definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.070" end="00:31:33.500" style="s2">there are honestly trillion dollar bills</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.010" end="00:31:40.040" style="s2">lying on the floor of Seattle San</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.500" end="00:31:41.900" style="s2">Francisco LA possibly even New York yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.040" end="00:31:43.520" style="s2">well yeah curious if you had any</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.900" end="00:31:46.400" style="s2">thoughts on what the sort of machinery</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.520" end="00:31:48.410" style="s2">for the alternate hypothesis of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.400" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">is that most power has been drained to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.410" end="00:31:53.390" style="s2">the center and so people are rationally</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:55.910" style="s2">ignoring local politics but I take it</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.390" end="00:31:58.790" style="s2">that&#39;s not your view well I think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.910" end="00:32:02.270" style="s2">the the periphery still remains far more</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.790" end="00:32:04.730" style="s2">illegible than the center then the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.270" end="00:32:07.100" style="s2">center would like to claim it is I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.730" end="00:32:08.809" style="s2">most people have no idea how things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.100" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">done in Chicago or how things are done</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.809" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">in New Orleans and I think most of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:14.450" style="s2">federal government doesn&#39;t I think the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">federal government has a very fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.450" end="00:32:22.100" style="s2">awareness of reality I think that yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.970" end="00:32:25.130" style="s2">there is an aspect of like you know of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.100" end="00:32:26.990" style="s2">autocracy where everyone can say no the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.130" end="00:32:29.450" style="s2">center is not managing anything but can</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.990" end="00:32:31.700" style="s2">say no to anything being done so</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.450" end="00:32:34.700" style="s2">thinking that way power has perhaps been</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.700" end="00:32:36.740" style="s2">drained but on the other one I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.700" end="00:32:39.620" style="s2">it&#39;s far more the case that were</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.740" end="00:32:42.549" style="s2">radically more risk-averse than we once</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.620" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">were no one&#39;s going to convince me that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.549" end="00:32:51.500" style="s2">the risk reward profile was more</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">favorable for say force a Bolshevik</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.500" end="00:32:56.840" style="s2">revolutionaries i unders arist Russia</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:59.510" style="s2">than it is for American citizens trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.840" end="00:33:01.640" style="s2">to get ahead in life in 2020 I really</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.510" end="00:33:06.350" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that I just think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.640" end="00:33:08.840" style="s2">there&#39;s something happening where their</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.350" end="00:33:11.090" style="s2">ability or desire to engage with power</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:12.850" style="s2">has atrophied so here&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.090" end="00:33:17.240" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.850" end="00:33:19.490" style="s2">what have we have in fact achieve the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.240" end="00:33:22.570" style="s2">stabilization of the world through a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.490" end="00:33:25.520" style="s2">severe deformation of the human spirit</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.570" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">what if the true problem was not wanting</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.520" end="00:33:30.559" style="s2">things I think I know this is like again</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:34.400" style="s2">a little bit controversial in in a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.559" end="00:33:36.110" style="s2">context right I certainly just I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.400" end="00:33:39.620" style="s2">consider something there right I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.110" end="00:33:41.059" style="s2">consider whether it is possible that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.620" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">people who are following national</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.059" end="00:33:44.210" style="s2">politics fundamentally just want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:46.490" style="s2">observe and don&#39;t actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.210" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">change that they&#39;re quite irrational in</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.490" end="00:33:49.220" style="s2">a different way</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:51.830" style="s2">they don&#39;t wish to participate they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.220" end="00:33:53.390" style="s2">just mildly nihilistic but they want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.830" end="00:33:55.820" style="s2">be seen as as virtuous and is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.390" end="00:33:58.040" style="s2">participating and is active so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.820" end="00:34:00.860" style="s2">easier to participate in a virtualized</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.040" end="00:34:04.360" style="s2">variant of national politics than it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.860" end="00:34:08.330" style="s2">to you know maintain local local stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.360" end="00:34:10.070" style="s2">self domestication maybe yeah yes / self</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.330" end="00:34:13.730" style="s2">domestication I mean Ted Kaczynski would</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.070" end="00:34:16.970" style="s2">call it what was it over socialization</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.000" end="00:34:39.169" style="s2">some of us who read the diamond age and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.220" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">we kind of have these ideas about like</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.169" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">I&#39;m technology and what we can do with</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">them alternative government systems um</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:47.960" style="s2">where do you see that going if people</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:50.270" style="s2">are basically like creating their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.960" end="00:34:54.109" style="s2">government systems I&#39;m with software</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.270" end="00:34:56.179" style="s2">what what is what what what could happen</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.829" end="00:36:36.270" style="s2">people who are right now 20 years old</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.930" end="00:36:38.910" style="s2">like they probably have to learn how to</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.910" end="00:36:42.349" style="s2">maybe figure out what a filesystem is</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.349" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">like I think I think maybe not 20 let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:50.369" style="s2">say 15 year olds someone was creating</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.730" end="00:37:16.500" style="s2">of technology like its way to those</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.710" end="00:37:27.720" style="s2">like their technology would that be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:29.490" style="s2">viable thing I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.720" end="00:37:31.619" style="s2">definitely viable the reason why I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.490" end="00:37:33.690" style="s2">that&#39;s viable is because we see very</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.619" end="00:37:37.950" style="s2">tiny weak variants of this with very</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.690" end="00:37:39.420" style="s2">niche bespoke online communities where</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.950" end="00:37:40.829" style="s2">people basically produce a different</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.310" end="00:37:50.040" style="s2">government propaganda right so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:52.470" style="s2">could happen but again I really think</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.040" end="00:37:58.900" style="s2">it&#39;s and what would that how would that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.470" end="00:38:02.529" style="s2">work I think that you know if you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.900" end="00:38:04.529" style="s2">somehow cause invisible coordination or</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.529" end="00:38:06.970" style="s2">no if you could somehow cause</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.529" end="00:38:09.609" style="s2">bureaucratically invisible coordination</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.970" end="00:38:12.069" style="s2">I think it actually doesn&#39;t take much to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.609" end="00:38:15.160" style="s2">take to take things over at all or to</p>

<p begin="00:38:15.160" end="00:38:19.059" style="s2">that the floor on this however is like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.109" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">kind of the level of coordination right</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.059" end="00:38:22.750" style="s2">so whatever software technology produces</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">this coordination between the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.750" end="00:38:27.190" style="s2">individuals has to be at least as good</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:30.220" style="s2">as the new conservative capture of US</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.390" end="00:38:38.140" style="s2">know that but you know the Church of</p>

<p begin="00:38:41.589" end="00:38:45.460" style="s2">operations no white weather just went</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.390" end="00:38:48.039" style="s2">and got hired in government bureaus and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.460" end="00:38:50.589" style="s2">then destroyed government documents on</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.039" end="00:38:52.599" style="s2">the Church of Scientology like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.589" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">such an effort successful the federal</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.599" end="00:38:55.480" style="s2">government would have effectively</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.440" end="00:39:00.010" style="s2">now talk about like that that would</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:02.799" style="s2">possibly make a very good book like an</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.799" end="00:39:10.809" style="s2">is the Church of Scientology maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.220" end="00:39:13.289" style="s2">has its own Epstein&#39;s to possibly next</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.809" end="00:39:13.289" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.160" end="00:39:26.770" style="s2">so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.100" end="00:39:29.500" style="s2">question hi sorry it&#39;s gonna post again</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.770" end="00:39:31.780" style="s2">um you&#39;ve said that it takes individual</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.500" end="00:39:34.810" style="s2">live players to wield power and build</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.780" end="00:39:37.750" style="s2">institutions but could this be a norm</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.810" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">but not a rule I wonder if perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.750" end="00:39:43.060" style="s2">what&#39;s really required is a living meme</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">or idea rather than any individual</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.060" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">player part of the thinking here is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:53.140" style="s2">um it&#39;s very difficult for a meme to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:55.300" style="s2">stay alive like it&#39;s almost as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.140" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">somebody copies it it becomes a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.300" end="00:40:00.820" style="s2">cargo cult version of the original</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.280" end="00:40:02.830" style="s2">living meme right you gets lost in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.820" end="00:40:08.230" style="s2">groupthink it uh it loses a bit of its</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.830" end="00:40:09.820" style="s2">life well really depends here what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.230" end="00:40:12.130" style="s2">mean by living meme you perhaps mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.820" end="00:40:15.340" style="s2">something that&#39;s like this like very</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.130" end="00:40:17.110" style="s2">generative true transmission of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.340" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">knowledge or do you mean something</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.110" end="00:40:25.600" style="s2">closer to the concept of an egregore or</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:32.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like a distributed intelligence I I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.600" end="00:40:35.380" style="s2">think I I&#39;m not sure but definition is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.130" end="00:40:37.470" style="s2">well I always think that the sociology</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.380" end="00:40:40.360" style="s2">of thinking about super organisms is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.470" end="00:40:42.820" style="s2">tricky right super organisms in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.360" end="00:40:44.710" style="s2">sense of like these these transhuman</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.820" end="00:40:46.990" style="s2">objects that allegedly might already</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.710" end="00:40:48.730" style="s2">exist where it&#39;s you know groups of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.990" end="00:40:51.100" style="s2">people behaving as if they have an</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.730" end="00:40:54.150" style="s2">emergent intelligence beyond beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.100" end="00:40:57.580" style="s2">of you know individual intelligence I</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.150" end="00:41:01.530" style="s2">think that since the sociology of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.580" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">is tricky I&#39;m like very hesitant to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.530" end="00:41:08.460" style="s2">let me put this way I can&#39;t rule it out</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:11.470" style="s2">I would not necessarily bet on it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.460" end="00:41:13.450" style="s2">because it seems that there is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.470" end="00:41:15.940" style="s2">difficulty in the transmission of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.450" end="00:41:17.650" style="s2">information between people I think we</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.940" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">have an easy time transmitting shallow</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.650" end="00:41:23.410" style="s2">information but a harder time</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:26.170" style="s2">transmitting complex or deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.410" end="00:41:28.330" style="s2">emotionally moving information which I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.170" end="00:41:30.490" style="s2">think makes the transmission of and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.330" end="00:41:34.680" style="s2">be mechanism agnostic here of what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.490" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">might term live means very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.680" end="00:41:38.130" style="s2">again you know arguably there might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">an exception with something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.130" end="00:41:45.360" style="s2">religious fever right that might be like</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:47.190" style="s2">living memes of a certain type and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.360" end="00:41:49.650" style="s2">might be hyper adaptive it might be</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.650" end="00:41:57.030" style="s2">perhaps another term people like to use</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.490" end="00:42:00.150" style="s2">but I&#39;ve seen little evidence of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.030" end="00:42:02.610" style="s2">things so yes it might be a norm it</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.150" end="00:42:04.320" style="s2">might be a norm it&#39;s possible there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.610" end="00:42:06.630" style="s2">some key innovation that would enable</p>

<p begin="00:42:07.590" end="00:42:12.630" style="s2">but I have to ask you know would</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.630" end="00:42:20.760" style="s2">actually good for us humans that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.340" end="00:42:22.860" style="s2">certainly debatable I I tend to believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.760" end="00:42:25.770" style="s2">though but you know that&#39;s my personal</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.860" end="00:42:27.570" style="s2">belief well thank you for the question I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.770" end="00:42:29.730" style="s2">certainly I&#39;m not averse to checking out</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.570" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">other frameworks and debating people and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.730" end="00:42:45.270" style="s2">other frameworks so it&#39;s very good night</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">am i okay so I just read out the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.270" end="00:42:51.000" style="s2">question cuz since I spent a significant</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:52.740" style="s2">amount of time saying it one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.000" end="00:42:54.930" style="s2">I have noticed and I want to bring to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.740" end="00:42:56.550" style="s2">salience is that there are some I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.930" end="00:43:00.360" style="s2">upstream factors when it comes to how</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.550" end="00:43:03.540" style="s2">effective life players are and one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.360" end="00:43:06.770" style="s2">them which I found is you know big</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.540" end="00:43:12.900" style="s2">locust of the current polarization is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.770" end="00:43:14.760" style="s2">how we socialize people to construe the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.900" end="00:43:17.610" style="s2">self and the demands placed upon the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.760" end="00:43:20.070" style="s2">self in order to coordinate at all like</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.610" end="00:43:22.890" style="s2">in the caricature trick version it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.070" end="00:43:25.850" style="s2">it&#39;s always just operation and you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.890" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">even the smallest inconvenience is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.850" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">intolerable violation in the caricatured</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.860" end="00:43:35.340" style="s2">conservative version it&#39;s an eternal</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.340" end="00:43:40.770" style="s2">to absolutely you&#39;re just a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.750" end="00:43:42.570" style="s2">person and there&#39;s not much of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.770" end="00:43:44.010" style="s2">discussion like both of these are locked</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.570" end="00:43:45.990" style="s2">in conflict and they seem to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.010" end="00:43:47.140" style="s2">alternatives as opposed to oh yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.990" end="00:43:49.120" style="s2">are trade-offs and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.140" end="00:43:51.100" style="s2">different individuals have different set</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.120" end="00:43:53.230" style="s2">points there are costs to having</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.100" end="00:43:55.000" style="s2">different set points you know in in both</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.230" end="00:43:59.110" style="s2">coordination as well as autonomy terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.000" end="00:44:02.020" style="s2">and being in the barrier this is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.110" end="00:44:03.640" style="s2">salient and if you and one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.020" end="00:44:05.740" style="s2">have noticed is that even the smallest</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.640" end="00:44:07.720" style="s2">coordinations which I found very trivial</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.740" end="00:44:10.810" style="s2">when I was in India like for people</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.720" end="00:44:12.250" style="s2">getting along without strife in a group</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.810" end="00:44:15.210" style="s2">house for example or just you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.250" end="00:44:21.340" style="s2">together for some reason seem to require</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.210" end="00:44:23.410" style="s2">monumental management of like most</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.340" end="00:44:27.090" style="s2">trivial individual concerns which</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.410" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">normally would really not be a thing so</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.090" end="00:44:30.940" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult for life players to</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:33.130" style="s2">operate in such an environment because</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.940" end="00:44:34.690" style="s2">the usual mechanisms for actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.130" end="00:44:36.940" style="s2">building anything right like the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.690" end="00:44:38.740" style="s2">out of which you will build it the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.940" end="00:44:43.600" style="s2">timber has one might say become a bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.740" end="00:44:45.940" style="s2">too crooked what&#39;s your view on this cuz</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.600" end="00:44:48.370" style="s2">I see an institutional application of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:50.620" style="s2">this just they seem to have you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.370" end="00:44:52.690" style="s2">just completely forgotten that part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.620" end="00:44:54.070" style="s2">their job is to help people get to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.690" end="00:44:57.970" style="s2">point where they can coordinate in</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.070" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">bigger numbers well yeah again this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.970" end="00:45:00.850" style="s2">sort of like I think the learning</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:02.230" style="s2">environment and the selection</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.850" end="00:45:05.170" style="s2">environment they&#39;re two separate things</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.230" end="00:45:06.700" style="s2">though they can coincide has been very</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.170" end="00:45:08.830" style="s2">unfavorable to live players right</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.700" end="00:45:10.420" style="s2">learning environment being where&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.830" end="00:45:13.180" style="s2">sandbox right where&#39;s your proving</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.420" end="00:45:17.170" style="s2">ground where&#39;s your you know courses on</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.180" end="00:45:18.760" style="s2">orem where mistakes can be made and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.170" end="00:45:20.430" style="s2">mistakes don&#39;t necessarily haunt you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.760" end="00:45:23.410" style="s2">twenty or thirty or forty years later</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.430" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">you know if you could disqualify the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.410" end="00:45:31.540" style="s2">julius caesar&#39;s of the world or the you</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">know or the the fineman&#39;s of the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.540" end="00:45:36.190" style="s2">by things that they said to their</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:37.510" style="s2">friends at twenty five or twenty well</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.190" end="00:45:39.460" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be many of them now would</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.510" end="00:45:41.350" style="s2">there right like almost all of them have</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.460" end="00:45:42.880" style="s2">these really crazy swings through their</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.350" end="00:45:44.770" style="s2">life when they&#39;re learning stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.880" end="00:45:46.630" style="s2">they already are causing real</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.770" end="00:45:49.090" style="s2">consequences of course like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.630" end="00:45:51.750" style="s2">absolve them of that but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.090" end="00:45:54.250" style="s2">supposed to be the teacher&#39;s pet and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.750" end="00:45:56.650" style="s2">today i think you are supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.250" end="00:45:58.870" style="s2">teacher&#39;s pet so there&#39;s the learning</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.650" end="00:46:00.170" style="s2">aspect is not encouraged because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.870" end="00:46:02.210" style="s2">a problematic person</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.170" end="00:46:06.170" style="s2">either in a corporate environment at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.210" end="00:46:08.300" style="s2">boardroom you know it&#39;s like descent</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.170" end="00:46:10.100" style="s2">isn&#39;t rewarded but even making the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.300" end="00:46:12.280" style="s2">conversation awkward isn&#39;t rewarded</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.100" end="00:46:14.870" style="s2">either in the boardroom or the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.280" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">so you have to really ask yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.870" end="00:46:19.330" style="s2">like at which point might someone going</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:21.410" style="s2">through a law career be like firmly</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.330" end="00:46:23.180" style="s2">rewarded and I&#39;m gonna say law is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.410" end="00:46:25.670" style="s2">actually better than a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.180" end="00:46:28.010" style="s2">domains I&#39;m gonna say something rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.670" end="00:46:31.580" style="s2">perhaps interesting here it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.010" end="00:46:34.550" style="s2">know lawyers have more diverse political</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.580" end="00:46:35.840" style="s2">views than say software engineers and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.550" end="00:46:39.230" style="s2">think that&#39;s because they have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.840" end="00:46:41.540" style="s2">comfort with power right and a higher</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.230" end="00:46:45.700" style="s2">comfort with power you show your</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.540" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">idiosyncrasies you don&#39;t hide them and</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.700" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">so the selection effect on the other end</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:54.260" style="s2">though is being you know what does the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:57.830" style="s2">admission system select for what this</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.260" end="00:47:00.230" style="s2">promotion select form so I think that a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.830" end="00:47:02.090" style="s2">lot of these live players at the early</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.230" end="00:47:04.790" style="s2">stages we try as hard as we can to</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.090" end="00:47:06.500" style="s2">disable them and I think perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.790" end="00:47:09.260" style="s2">know the obstacle course has just grown</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.500" end="00:47:10.730" style="s2">too difficult but the fun fact is this</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.260" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">obstacle course was built by Life</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.730" end="00:47:15.170" style="s2">players in the first place and</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:17.090" style="s2">eventually it&#39;ll come crumbling down the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.170" end="00:47:19.340" style="s2">question is only how catastrophic Lee</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.090" end="00:47:20.810" style="s2">right and what level of skill and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.340" end="00:47:23.870" style="s2">organization will you have available</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.810" end="00:47:26.090" style="s2">around there and I honestly think most</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.870" end="00:47:31.460" style="s2">of them don&#39;t even realize that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.090" end="00:47:34.730" style="s2">have a role in in grooming or enabling</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.460" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">the next generation right I think they</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.730" end="00:47:39.740" style="s2">take these structures that they lived in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:41.720" style="s2">as immutable laws of nature they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.740" end="00:47:43.000" style="s2">believe them to be the work of human</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.720" end="00:47:45.590" style="s2">hands</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.000" end="00:47:48.860" style="s2">much like the medieval start of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.590" end="00:47:50.780" style="s2">massive building syndrome right very</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.860" end="00:47:53.720" style="s2">much so yeah the work of giants right</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.780" end="00:47:56.930" style="s2">yeah like you know in um you know early</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.720" end="00:47:59.300" style="s2">medieval Europe Roman ruins would often</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.930" end="00:48:02.150" style="s2">be attributed to giants much as in</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.300" end="00:48:05.030" style="s2">classical Greek Greece my Seon ruins</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.150" end="00:48:06.380" style="s2">were attributed to giants because the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.030" end="00:48:08.210" style="s2">idea of like organizing such</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.380" end="00:48:11.630" style="s2">construction efforts it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.210" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">seems ludicrously wasteful right you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.630" end="00:48:13.609" style="s2">perceive them as a feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:18.829" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.609" end="00:48:20.599" style="s2">scape like mountains so my concern was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.829" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">follow on with that as in even if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.599" end="00:48:24.890" style="s2">assume an environment where life players</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:28.009" style="s2">are not fully weeded out they still need</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.890" end="00:48:29.690" style="s2">humans capable of coordination the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.009" end="00:48:31.460" style="s2">material of which the systems are made</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.690" end="00:48:33.829" style="s2">in the such people are in very short</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.460" end="00:48:35.150" style="s2">supply right now yeah yeah yeah like but</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.829" end="00:48:38.539" style="s2">I do think you can find them I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.150" end="00:48:40.460" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to use online sort of</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.549" end="00:48:54.200" style="s2">trite because people take a watered-down</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.200" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">replenishes America well if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.589" end="00:49:02.059" style="s2">the people who shaped America in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:04.549" style="s2">1940s almost none of them were born in</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.059" end="00:49:06.019" style="s2">America except for FDR and the core the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.549" end="00:49:08.930" style="s2">core Democrats like if you look at all</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.019" end="00:49:10.999" style="s2">the scientists right or if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.930" end="00:49:14.749" style="s2">the 50 60 s and 70s all the cultural</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.749" end="00:49:19.430" style="s2">come from these European and East Asian</p>

<p begin="00:49:21.769" end="00:49:27.559" style="s2">like they either flee chaos or you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.890" end="00:49:32.779" style="s2">or they try to try to make do after</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.559" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">they&#39;re defeated and this this method</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.779" end="00:49:36.680" style="s2">means that in fact around the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:38.980" style="s2">there are still places where life</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.680" end="00:49:42.710" style="s2">players have an easier time arising</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.980" end="00:49:44.630" style="s2">right so I don&#39;t think you actually in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.710" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">modern context ever see anything like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.630" end="00:49:51.079" style="s2">barbarian invasion but you might easily</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:53.089" style="s2">have it be so that you know the elites</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.079" end="00:49:55.640" style="s2">of the elites of our remaining the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.089" end="00:49:58.489" style="s2">elites of Armenia are just like actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.640" end="00:50:00.410" style="s2">trained on power politics and they move</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.489" end="00:50:03.289" style="s2">to the US and wielded disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.410" end="00:50:04.819" style="s2">influence or say Cuban refugees like for</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.289" end="00:50:07.670" style="s2">example I think it might be a very good</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.819" end="00:50:09.349" style="s2">idea for the u.s. to you know accept 3</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.670" end="00:50:12.249" style="s2">million people from Hong Kong because I</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.349" end="00:50:14.089" style="s2">expect those 3 million people to produce</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.249" end="00:50:15.470" style="s2">individuals who are way better at</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.089" end="00:50:17.539" style="s2">running you know way better at</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.470" end="00:50:19.640" style="s2">maintaining power than the typical</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.539" end="00:50:21.289" style="s2">American is right and they have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.640" end="00:50:23.299" style="s2">ecosystem it like because it&#39;s a mass</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.289" end="00:50:23.770" style="s2">migration it&#39;s effectively importing an</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.299" end="00:50:26.790" style="s2">entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.770" end="00:50:30.100" style="s2">living ecosan put and put an entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.790" end="00:50:31.900" style="s2">ruling class right yeah yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.100" end="00:50:33.340" style="s2">I think what I&#39;m implicitly saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.900" end="00:50:35.080" style="s2">here&#39;s a little bit controversial is</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.340" end="00:50:37.510" style="s2">that you know immigration of the ruling</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.080" end="00:50:39.369" style="s2">class prolongs the life of empire like</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.510" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">this is one of the advantages of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.369" end="00:50:46.330" style="s2">byzantium right so again there are these</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:48.280" style="s2">bypasses right you can do but they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.330" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">they are bypasses and they&#39;re all rather</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.280" end="00:50:53.410" style="s2">awkward and they the conditions of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:55.210" style="s2">superstructure can&#39;t persist forever</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.410" end="00:50:58.810" style="s2">then the question is well when does it</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.210" end="00:51:01.420" style="s2">burn down no surprises yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.810" end="00:51:05.320" style="s2">that is at the moment one America which</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.420" end="00:51:06.940" style="s2">is you know post-war order and if your</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.320" end="00:51:09.010" style="s2">hypothesis is taken seriously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.940" end="00:51:11.830" style="s2">it&#39;s actually possible that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.010" end="00:51:15.670" style="s2">a lot of it is I mean I won&#39;t go so far</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.830" end="00:51:17.350" style="s2">as to say parasitic but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.670" end="00:51:19.810" style="s2">the third generation migrant cannot do</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.350" end="00:51:21.910" style="s2">what their grandparent did like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.810" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">real loss in some sense well it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.910" end="00:51:27.100" style="s2">of weird right why is it possible for</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:29.580" style="s2">immigrant communities to come to the US</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.100" end="00:51:32.380" style="s2">and set up their own parallel social and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.580" end="00:51:34.780" style="s2">economic base and trade favors</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.380" end="00:51:37.720" style="s2">yet it&#39;s not possible for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.780" end="00:51:40.090" style="s2">born in America it&#39;s really weird right</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.720" end="00:51:41.590" style="s2">something&#39;s happening here I think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.090" end="00:51:43.210" style="s2">in an important way though I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.590" end="00:51:45.869" style="s2">to focus on America do all the critiques</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.210" end="00:51:49.300" style="s2">I love you to also apply to Europe and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.869" end="00:51:54.119" style="s2">you know it&#39;s they apply quite strongly</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.300" end="00:51:59.740" style="s2">to Western Europe so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.119" end="00:52:01.780" style="s2">there&#39;s no there are some simple changes</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.740" end="00:52:03.490" style="s2">again if you could real ouka lies the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.780" end="00:52:05.859" style="s2">media landscape I think you would have</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.490" end="00:52:07.690" style="s2">way more people engaging with cultural</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.859" end="00:52:09.400" style="s2">production and if people are engaging</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.690" end="00:52:11.020" style="s2">with cultural production some of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.400" end="00:52:14.080" style="s2">graduate to engaging with social</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.020" end="00:52:16.990" style="s2">engineering alternatively if there were</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.080" end="00:52:19.330" style="s2">opportunities for like you know combat</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.990" end="00:52:20.500" style="s2">of some kind that might also produce</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.330" end="00:52:23.260" style="s2">such elites but there are few</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.500" end="00:52:26.530" style="s2">opportunities like that very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.260" end="00:52:29.100" style="s2">to keep those around cool shall we go to</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.530" end="00:52:29.100" style="s2">the next question</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.930" end="00:52:37.800" style="s2">my question is you just keep riffing on</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.280" end="00:52:40.930" style="s2">that that&#39;s really interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.800" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">importation of the ruling classes are</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.930" end="00:52:47.320" style="s2">good people from other countries curious</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:48.940" style="s2">if you amor to say okay you take people</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.320" end="00:52:51.310" style="s2">who have had radically different early</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.940" end="00:52:53.619" style="s2">life experiences and radically different</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.310" end="00:52:55.450" style="s2">information about the world and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.619" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">allowed to make their mistakes in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.450" end="00:52:59.800" style="s2">different system of accounting so if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:02.470" style="s2">have a system of accounting where</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.800" end="00:53:03.910" style="s2">mistakes are penalized you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.470" end="00:53:05.470" style="s2">let&#39;s look at someone like Slava</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.910" end="00:53:08.710" style="s2">Dziedzic for example I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.470" end="00:53:12.820" style="s2">name him because there&#39;s there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.710" end="00:53:14.590" style="s2">reading some of his stuff lately in</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.820" end="00:53:17.530" style="s2">Yugoslavia right even though he was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.590" end="00:53:20.230" style="s2">communist he was barred from teaching on</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.530" end="00:53:22.869" style="s2">a blacklist right so he graduated he had</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.230" end="00:53:26.140" style="s2">post-grad program he went through it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.869" end="00:53:27.910" style="s2">was utterly unemployable because of his</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.140" end="00:53:32.140" style="s2">political views he was advocating the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.910" end="00:53:35.020" style="s2">wrong type of communism this reputation</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.140" end="00:53:37.540" style="s2">the sort of negative blacklist that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.020" end="00:53:40.180" style="s2">a result of him learning thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.540" end="00:53:42.580" style="s2">sometimes saying the wrong thing didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.180" end="00:53:44.380" style="s2">weigh him down at all in the Western</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.580" end="00:53:45.940" style="s2">world if anything the Western world</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.380" end="00:53:47.619" style="s2">perversely like it helped him right</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.940" end="00:53:51.550" style="s2">because he had the Patna of being a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.619" end="00:53:54.010" style="s2">dissident I think this learning</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.550" end="00:53:55.390" style="s2">environment and escaping the initial</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.010" end="00:53:57.070" style="s2">learning environment so you make your</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.390" end="00:53:58.900" style="s2">mistakes early into a different</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.070" end="00:54:00.970" style="s2">environment allows you kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.900" end="00:54:03.640" style="s2">start with a clean slate that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.970" end="00:54:06.040" style="s2">mechanism the other mechanism is you are</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.640" end="00:54:07.750" style="s2">exposed and lack you are exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.040" end="00:54:09.820" style="s2">really different life experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.750" end="00:54:13.060" style="s2">you don&#39;t share any of the unstated</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.820" end="00:54:16.210" style="s2">assumptions of a society number three I</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.060" end="00:54:17.800" style="s2">think that also there&#39;s this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.210" end="00:54:20.619" style="s2">this legitimately different base of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.800" end="00:54:23.590" style="s2">knowledge you might have Henry Kissinger</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.619" end="00:54:25.840" style="s2">was steeped in history because he grew</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.590" end="00:54:28.330" style="s2">up in a German environment in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.840" end="00:54:31.420" style="s2">no post-war German or America never</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.330" end="00:54:32.230" style="s2">could be right and then this this kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.420" end="00:54:34.450" style="s2">of thoughtfulness</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.230" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">I think changed his view of things right</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.450" end="00:54:37.930" style="s2">and then one can say good or negative</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:40.570" style="s2">things about what he did but I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.930" end="00:54:43.109" style="s2">again the reality was very much very</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.570" end="00:54:43.109" style="s2">much there</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.440" end="00:54:47.829" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s also of course a</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.700" end="00:54:50.920" style="s2">selection effect where to leave a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.829" end="00:54:52.569" style="s2">country that&#39;s unstable is it&#39;s out only</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.920" end="00:54:55.630" style="s2">something you can exercise with quite a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.569" end="00:54:58.020" style="s2">bit of privilege to begin with so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.630" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s usually has some selection</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.020" end="00:55:03.700" style="s2">pressures there and I think number five</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:07.240" style="s2">you know as a for the fifth kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.700" end="00:55:10.030" style="s2">factor is well all the people that leave</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.240" end="00:55:12.910" style="s2">with you are themselves the network who</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.030" end="00:55:14.589" style="s2">suddenly feel hungry again so their</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.910" end="00:55:16.300" style="s2">skills might be the skills of someone</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.589" end="00:55:18.579" style="s2">who&#39;s mid-level in a different system</p>

<p begin="00:55:18.579" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">they&#39;re low level they feel that hunger</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.010" end="00:55:26.290" style="s2">right and they want to work together to</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.290" end="00:55:31.660" style="s2">next question so I&#39;m sorry if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.339" end="00:55:34.569" style="s2">mind me asking a quick follow-up</p>

<p begin="00:55:37.240" end="00:55:47.800" style="s2">would come out of your view about</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.859" end="00:55:50.740" style="s2">immigration I think the u.s. is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.800" end="00:55:58.210" style="s2">efficient at harnessing the talent of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.740" end="00:56:00.730" style="s2">various countries I think that I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.210" end="00:56:04.060" style="s2">probably attempt freedom of movement</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.730" end="00:56:05.950" style="s2">with allied countries but in only</p>

<p begin="00:56:05.950" end="00:56:10.359" style="s2">actually speed things up notably there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:12.069" style="s2">more circulation of elite within the</p>

<p begin="00:56:12.069" end="00:56:16.450" style="s2">going to dysfunctional Brussels but it</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.829" end="00:56:19.240" style="s2">does happen there&#39;s a brain drain from</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.450" end="00:56:21.880" style="s2">the small countries like you know my</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.240" end="00:56:25.180" style="s2">native Slovenia or the Czech Republic or</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.880" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">Portugal or Denmark where the people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.180" end="00:56:30.460" style="s2">feel themselves talented or ambitious no</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:31.720" style="s2">longer aspire to the peaks of national</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.460" end="00:56:34.420" style="s2">politics so they don&#39;t want to be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.720" end="00:56:36.490" style="s2">president of Portugal they might</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.420" end="00:56:38.349" style="s2">actually want to be a commissioner in</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.490" end="00:56:41.260" style="s2">Brussels so if hypothetically imagine</p>

<p begin="00:56:41.260" end="00:56:46.089" style="s2">result would be a bunch of random</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.180" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">Europeans who otherwise would have tried</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.089" end="00:56:51.460" style="s2">to become the French president or Prime</p>

<p begin="00:57:00.470" end="00:57:08.359" style="s2">was China the result is the Communist</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.400" end="00:57:17.480" style="s2">that&#39;s really interesting thanks I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.430" style="s2">great we&#39;re coming up to the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.480" end="00:57:21.770" style="s2">hour but we do have one question here</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.430" end="00:57:32.230" style="s2">that&#39;s been uploaded by Tyson do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.770" end="00:57:32.230" style="s2">mind answering it ok what&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.839" end="00:57:38.869" style="s2">yeah sure um question is about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.720" end="00:57:40.520" style="s2">sandbox and there&#39;s also open just</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.869" end="00:57:44.390" style="s2">hearing what people might pop in a chat</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.520" end="00:57:46.130" style="s2">but the show up and like practices like</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.390" end="00:57:48.349" style="s2">freestyle and practices and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.130" end="00:57:52.339" style="s2">self-expression and dialogue have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.349" end="00:57:55.579" style="s2">this new sandbox of sorts for me and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.339" end="00:57:57.470" style="s2">I&#39;m just curious about other ways that</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.579" end="00:57:59.740" style="s2">the sandbox is showing up that maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.470" end="00:58:02.200" style="s2">missing or not aware it could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.740" end="00:58:07.099" style="s2">geographical communities it could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.200" end="00:58:09.260" style="s2">practices modalities see I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.099" end="00:58:11.810" style="s2">like where are the best sandbox is for</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.260" end="00:58:12.380" style="s2">truly experimenting playing making</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.810" end="00:58:16.700" style="s2">mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.380" end="00:58:20.839" style="s2">discovering Twitter anonymity if you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.700" end="00:58:22.520" style="s2">keep it so but only if you can keep it</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.839" end="00:58:25.579" style="s2">right because otherwise you&#39;re producing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.520" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">producing issues for yourself I as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.579" end="00:58:30.050" style="s2">policy don&#39;t don&#39;t have any pseudonymous</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:33.650" style="s2">alts because I just think that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.050" end="00:58:36.170" style="s2">too dangerous if you end up being</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.650" end="00:58:38.180" style="s2">observed but in a very deep and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.170" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">important way I think the internet</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.180" end="00:58:42.380" style="s2">allowed some of this the key problem is</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:44.210" style="s2">it kind of missed directs attention in</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.380" end="00:58:46.609" style="s2">the same way I was describing of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.210" end="00:58:48.380" style="s2">symbolic where you&#39;re kind of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.609" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">plugged into the matrix and you forget</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.380" end="00:58:52.760" style="s2">your physical surroundings this means</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:55.220" style="s2">that for the most part it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.760" end="00:58:58.220" style="s2">extremely difficult you know to both</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.220" end="00:59:01.280" style="s2">experiment in a way that has access to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.220" end="00:59:03.410" style="s2">economic levers or even to social fabric</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.280" end="00:59:07.550" style="s2">that might be useful or strategically</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.410" end="00:59:08.750" style="s2">deployable so I would suggest online</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.550" end="00:59:13.100" style="s2">meetup groups</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.750" end="00:59:15.590" style="s2">so you create you create this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.100" end="00:59:17.690" style="s2">you search for unusual people and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.590" end="00:59:21.020" style="s2">in an urban center you start up a group</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.690" end="00:59:22.370" style="s2">of people who you met online you try</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.020" end="00:59:24.860" style="s2">your best to get to know them as people</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.370" end="00:59:28.360" style="s2">try to bet for those of bad character</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.860" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">and try to have regular gatherings and</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.360" end="00:59:32.840" style="s2">eventually real projects so real</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.150" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.840" end="00:59:36.830" style="s2">ideally construction if you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.150" end="00:59:38.930" style="s2">construction</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.830" end="00:59:42.200" style="s2">some sort of you know cultural activity</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.930" end="00:59:44.330" style="s2">or event thrown by this group for people</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.200" end="00:59:46.760" style="s2">that they know from everyday life right</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.330" end="00:59:48.350" style="s2">so either mint the social capital by</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.760" end="00:59:50.690" style="s2">bringing together a bunch of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.350" end="00:59:52.370" style="s2">to organize an event that&#39;s not aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.690" end="00:59:55.370" style="s2">the other internet people but is aimed</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.370" end="00:59:57.010" style="s2">at local community members or bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.370" end="00:59:59.660" style="s2">together the internet people and</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.010" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">construct something physical doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.660" end="01:00:05.150" style="s2">matter what it is right in these two I</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:07.340" style="s2">think are super fruitful generators for</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.150" end="01:00:09.080" style="s2">learning things you&#39;ll learn slightly</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.340" end="01:00:11.120" style="s2">different things but one will definitely</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.080" end="01:00:12.620" style="s2">learn things that way and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.120" end="01:00:14.870" style="s2">initial selection has to be sourced</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.620" end="01:00:17.750" style="s2">online and to online intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.870" end="01:00:19.520" style="s2">experimentation because the the native</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.750" end="01:00:21.320" style="s2">environment is so impoverished for</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.520" end="01:00:24.170" style="s2">people who have the excess energy or</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.320" end="01:00:26.780" style="s2">will to do this or honestly the mental</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.170" end="01:00:28.490" style="s2">health at this point you know people</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.780" end="01:00:30.680" style="s2">talk about the mental health crisis you</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.490" end="01:00:33.350" style="s2">know perhaps perhaps we&#39;re actually just</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.680" end="01:00:37.940" style="s2">living in a society or where everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.350" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">has profound issues thank you really</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.940" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">appreciate you for being here in these</p>

<p begin="01:00:49.340" end="01:00:56.660" style="s2">fail but at least hopefully the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.530" end="01:00:58.820" style="s2">questions were addressed great so we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.660" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">catch you next week at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.820" end="01:01:03.950" style="s2">look forward to it I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:06.170" style="s2">plenty to talk about then any final</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.950" end="01:01:10.280" style="s2">words for a samo before I tell people</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.170" end="01:01:14.110" style="s2">about upcoming events right for for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.280" end="01:01:14.110" style="s2">concluding thought I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.250" end="01:01:19.100" style="s2">produce an environment where you might</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.390" end="01:01:20.750" style="s2">make mistakes and when you can do</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.100" end="01:01:22.250" style="s2">something completely different than</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.750" end="01:01:27.740" style="s2">what&#39;s acceptable in your current so</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.250" end="01:01:30.080" style="s2">for circle just try to do it and then if</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.740" end="01:01:35.390" style="s2">you can introspect on what this does for</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.080" end="01:01:38.210" style="s2">you and also if possible don&#39;t avoid</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.390" end="01:01:39.950" style="s2">power like try to accept power I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.210" end="01:01:42.410" style="s2">we&#39;ve been told that exercising and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.950" end="01:01:45.260" style="s2">having power is bad precisely because</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.410" end="01:01:48.020" style="s2">the top doesn&#39;t want any competition and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.260" end="01:01:52.060" style="s2">I think we for the sake of everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.020" end="01:01:55.180" style="s2">right there has to be competition there</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.060" end="01:01:55.180" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.540" end="01:02:01.310" style="s2">great and so just a heads up for</p>
