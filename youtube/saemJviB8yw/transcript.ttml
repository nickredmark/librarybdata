<p begin="00:00:02.250" end="00:00:11.090" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re in having some solutions or</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:11.090" style="s2">what you have heard so far so welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.840" end="00:00:20.850" style="s2">can you hear me yes you hear me yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.930" end="00:00:22.650" style="s2">hi everybody nice to meet you i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.850" end="00:00:27.710" style="s2">in northwest connecticut on a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.650" end="00:00:33.230" style="s2">spring day so i imagine you all here</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.710" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">enjoying the sunshine in the birds on i</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.230" end="00:00:39.930" style="s2">I think I&#39;ll start out by being</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">provocative it&#39;s not unlike me so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.930" end="00:00:47.100" style="s2">way kind of get to know me and I i well</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:51.350" style="s2">first of all I do want to say that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.100" end="00:00:53.550" style="s2">launching a soul we call it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.350" end="00:00:56.539" style="s2">self-organizing learning experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.550" end="00:00:59.609" style="s2">rather than a term eat recalled</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.539" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">self-organized learning environment so</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.609" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">we&#39;re emphasizing the process nature of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">the experiment and more starting that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">this in two weeks actually have an</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">eight-week program and so at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:16.200" style="s2">the summer I&#39;ll have a lot more actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">practical things to say about our</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.200" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">experiment but what I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">offer this group is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">provocative comments and it really I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:31.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t plan to start this way but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">conversation between leaf and Michelle</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.460" end="00:01:40.020" style="s2">kind of reached in me and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">drawing it out so I would recommend a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.020" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">strong self reflection about their peer</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:51.530" style="s2">to peer movement chasing the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">economy I think the knowledge economy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.530" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">kind of done and I think this is why</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">we&#39;re strategies that institutions are</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:00.710" style="s2">making now I mean they&#39;re dumping all</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">their products you can say online</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.710" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">they&#39;re making everything free they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:10.349" style="s2">these MOOCs they have basically if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">understand the mindset of a knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.349" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">entrepreneur they&#39;re saying these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">free they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:18.450" style="s2">they&#39;re not worth anything to us anymore</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:20.580" style="s2">I mean this is these are provocative</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.450" end="00:02:23.910" style="s2">statements I&#39;m over emphasizing it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.580" end="00:02:26.430" style="s2">so the question is you know what is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.910" end="00:02:31.050" style="s2">is coming at us in the future what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.430" end="00:02:33.510" style="s2">the imaginative leap that this community</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.050" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">should make in some of these experiments</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.510" end="00:02:40.170" style="s2">in other words if we have a design</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.370" end="00:02:42.330" style="s2">intent that isn&#39;t is is future forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.170" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">then we won&#39;t have this problem that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.330" end="00:02:46.890" style="s2">Michelle just said in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">we&#39;re always racing against time and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.890" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">these are the kinds of questions we ask</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">here at all the law because we run a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:03:04.740" style="s2">process called insight practice and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">it in given this question in terms of so</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.740" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">let me make some distinctions for</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:12.330" style="s2">example the knowledge economy right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">is based upon the organizing storage and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.330" end="00:03:19.410" style="s2">retrieval of known information right</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">what is known and machines are doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">that for us really really well and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.920" end="00:03:27.270" style="s2">will probably be doing all of that for</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:31.140" style="s2">us in the very near future so this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.270" end="00:03:35.730" style="s2">what Einstein predicted so this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.140" end="00:03:37.320" style="s2">becoming a less and less of a value and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.730" end="00:03:38.910" style="s2">I think that&#39;s why institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.320" end="00:03:40.380" style="s2">governments don&#39;t care if there&#39;s MOOCs</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.910" end="00:03:41.670" style="s2">and all this stuff I mean they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:46.050" style="s2">don&#39;t want to chase something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.670" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">being so quickly devalued its devalue</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.050" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">just like everything else is because</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:51.300" style="s2">robots and machines are going to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:53.900" style="s2">care of her better so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.300" end="00:03:56.550" style="s2">what do we want to do you know engage</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.900" end="00:03:58.739" style="s2">people that have the values of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.550" end="00:04:03.590" style="s2">community into creating the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.739" end="00:04:08.250" style="s2">through these kinds of nishat evoke ille</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.590" end="00:04:10.320" style="s2">centers of Education I mean I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">many of you you know we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.320" end="00:04:13.890" style="s2">get institutional affiliation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">trying to start something as a living</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.890" end="00:04:23.220" style="s2">center of the future of education here</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:25.500" style="s2">at my home farm so that&#39;s I think a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.220" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">important question we answer in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.500" end="00:04:29.099" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:33.210" style="s2">we answer it in the sense that what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.099" end="00:04:38.219" style="s2">think is the value in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.210" end="00:04:41.039" style="s2">newest fear is innovation and insight</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.219" end="00:04:48.180" style="s2">insightful ideas complete paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.039" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">and so so that would be something that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.180" end="00:04:54.689" style="s2">would suggest those of you that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.180" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">working on new schools to really take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.689" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">good look at what are the capacities</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.300" end="00:05:01.949" style="s2">what are the capacities that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:06.870" style="s2">generation needs and I think these are</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.949" end="00:05:10.259" style="s2">capacities all around the world and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.870" end="00:05:14.039" style="s2">take different forms so an insight or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.259" end="00:05:18.539" style="s2">paradigm shift in Ecuador Africa maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.039" end="00:05:23.460" style="s2">more like solving this transportation to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.539" end="00:05:27.810" style="s2">value problem in another area it might</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.460" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">be coming up with what I call the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.810" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">the third term in economics so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:35.189" style="s2">one of the things for example we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">looking at there&#39;s assets liabilities</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.189" end="00:05:39.539" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a third term that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:42.389" style="s2">should be incorporated in economics so</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.539" end="00:05:47.069" style="s2">these are big ideas they&#39;re easy to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.389" end="00:05:49.949" style="s2">design I think that they are this for me</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.069" end="00:05:53.250" style="s2">is what we should be designing education</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.949" end="00:05:55.020" style="s2">for in the future and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:57.659" style="s2">and I think that plays into some of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:06:01.189" style="s2">Leif was asking about futures and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.659" end="00:06:05.729" style="s2">second thing I just want to say is um</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.189" end="00:06:08.069" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which and we could</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.729" end="00:06:11.250" style="s2">all have a long discussion about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.069" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">but in terms of talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.250" end="00:06:17.189" style="s2">comments and if we talk about knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.620" end="00:06:19.469" style="s2">as a Commons again when I hear that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.189" end="00:06:24.050" style="s2">phrase I think of it as something you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.469" end="00:06:26.969" style="s2">know known what is known is is should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.050" end="00:06:30.029" style="s2">accessible and I think that&#39;s true we</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.969" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">need universal access to the external</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.029" end="00:06:37.169" style="s2">storage networks of what is known but</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:40.110" style="s2">what is the concept of Commons with</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.169" end="00:06:40.600" style="s2">relative to what is not known relative</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.110" end="00:06:43.630" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.600" end="00:06:46.570" style="s2">generation of new ideas the generation</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.630" end="00:06:48.370" style="s2">of designs for the future of our our</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.570" end="00:06:51.010" style="s2">children what&#39;s the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.370" end="00:06:52.660" style="s2">Commons there and so I think we get it</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.010" end="00:06:55.090" style="s2">gets a little tricky because all of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.660" end="00:06:58.120" style="s2">definitions appear to appear in comments</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.090" end="00:07:02.290" style="s2">are actually an obstacle to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.120" end="00:07:04.030" style="s2">into the terms of those and so the work</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.290" end="00:07:10.530" style="s2">we&#39;re doing makes a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.030" end="00:07:14.820" style="s2">peer-to-peer which is in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.530" end="00:07:17.170" style="s2">understood as universal access to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.820" end="00:07:19.090" style="s2">comments and then the and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.170" end="00:07:20.890" style="s2">interactions are static you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.090" end="00:07:23.550" style="s2">interact with the commons and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.890" end="00:07:27.910" style="s2">something comes back and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.550" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">versus true participatory interactions</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.910" end="00:07:36.280" style="s2">where the known external network is just</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:39.160" style="s2">a box you can draw from and to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.280" end="00:07:41.620" style="s2">truly participatory commons means that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.160" end="00:07:45.310" style="s2">these Commons are enacted in real time</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.620" end="00:07:47.590" style="s2">by participation and so those are kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.310" end="00:07:49.710" style="s2">of like two big ideas I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.590" end="00:07:52.930" style="s2">throw out there to give you an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.710" end="00:07:55.830" style="s2">what I would hope is a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.930" end="00:08:04.540" style="s2">contribution to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.830" end="00:08:08.230" style="s2">brilliant colors and philly kami yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.540" end="00:08:13.260" style="s2">I can so where are you now are you nice</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.530" end="00:12:37.970" style="s2">into the 50 unknown and have kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.320" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">confidence that we don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.970" end="00:12:43.610" style="s2">every way leads us many people have</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:45.470" style="s2">these variables to do but none of us can</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.269" end="00:13:33.079" style="s2">exactly around those environments to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">form themselves very celebratory and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.079" end="00:13:39.110" style="s2">that way we very often don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:40.819" style="s2">plan how things should look like we just</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.110" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">have to look back and reflect okay what</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.819" end="00:13:45.589" style="s2">what happened what Burke and what what</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:48.110" style="s2">did we learn from our the last two steps</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.589" end="00:13:50.149" style="s2">in order to make the next step we very</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.110" end="00:13:52.069" style="s2">often think we already have to know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.149" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">form the fifth level this I think this</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.069" end="00:14:01.810" style="s2">is in our times it it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:14:06.139" style="s2">challenging very uh yeah kind of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.810" end="00:14:09.019" style="s2">and so I think there have been many many</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.139" end="00:14:11.560" style="s2">with good examples where an order</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">and sold at for digital humanities um I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.149" end="00:16:25.970" style="s2">have a couple comments here that first</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.850" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">of all I start with that that p2p as I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.970" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">see it is the productive capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:39.259" style="s2">civil society so for example you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:41.930" style="s2">governments States NGOs the military the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.259" end="00:16:45.550" style="s2">capitalist sector corporations all can</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.930" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">produce pharmaceuticals and cars</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.550" end="00:16:52.250" style="s2">satellites biomedical equipment that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">civil society up to this point has only</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.250" end="00:16:59.480" style="s2">been able to be involved in political</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:01.939" style="s2">protest it has been very powerful as you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:06.439" style="s2">know but it hasn&#39;t been able to produce</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.939" end="00:17:09.740" style="s2">say pharmaceuticals so when Africa tried</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.439" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">to in 2001 whenever to try to produce</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.740" end="00:17:13.970" style="s2">their own pharmaceuticals and then the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:17.799" style="s2">consortium of pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.970" end="00:17:21.079" style="s2">block them there is no other outlet</p>

<p begin="00:17:21.079" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">drugs for AIDS patients so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.659" end="00:17:34.340" style="s2">build a knowledge base for commons that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.770" style="s2">can have productive capacity come out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.340" end="00:17:39.590" style="s2">that and things like pharmaceuticals and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.770" end="00:17:42.620" style="s2">other things that we need so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.590" end="00:17:45.380" style="s2">thesis there I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.620" end="00:17:48.650" style="s2">the edgy no future foundation is working</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.380" end="00:17:51.350" style="s2">there in Ecuador that Michelle talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.650" end="00:17:54.890" style="s2">about a moto what what he is doing there</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.350" end="00:17:56.990" style="s2">is this basically you have a country</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.890" end="00:18:00.620" style="s2">that has plenty of natural resources</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.990" end="00:18:02.870" style="s2">that are exploited and shipped out that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.620" end="00:18:05.240" style="s2">they can leverage that wealth to move</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.870" end="00:18:07.580" style="s2">from savory industrialization over at</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.240" end="00:18:11.450" style="s2">the knowledge economy and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.580" end="00:18:13.880" style="s2">free libre and open knowledge that term</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.450" end="00:18:16.460" style="s2">means for plot society then indeed I</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.880" end="00:18:18.800" style="s2">think that it is possible for them over</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.460" end="00:18:20.840" style="s2">quickly I mean if countries don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.800" end="00:18:24.770" style="s2">if China doesn&#39;t do this a South Korea</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.840" end="00:18:27.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do it or and Japan there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.770" end="00:18:29.809" style="s2">to be major societies in decline so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.170" end="00:18:32.120" style="s2">can speak about East Asia where I met</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.809" end="00:18:34.490" style="s2">moment one thing but in that case in</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.120" end="00:18:36.200" style="s2">Ecuador it&#39;s the similar kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.490" end="00:18:39.470" style="s2">they can leverage that well that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.200" end="00:18:41.420" style="s2">have move into a better structure and at</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.470" end="00:18:44.570" style="s2">the base of all of us is knowledge just</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.420" end="00:18:47.000" style="s2">as lief said earlier about the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.570" end="00:18:48.530" style="s2">its eight hundred years ago but in leaf</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.000" end="00:18:52.220" style="s2">I&#39;d like to get some more references to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.530" end="00:18:55.809" style="s2">that later on what Bonnie said a moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.220" end="00:18:59.059" style="s2">ago amount of access to the Commons as</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.809" end="00:19:01.580" style="s2">being different than necessarily p2p</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.059" end="00:19:04.130" style="s2">productive capacity is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.580" end="00:19:07.460" style="s2">because we do need to have universal</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.130" end="00:19:10.130" style="s2">access to a comments such that no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.460" end="00:19:12.890" style="s2">left out but that doesn&#39;t mean that on</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.130" end="00:19:14.720" style="s2">top of that calm comes that assisted</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.890" end="00:19:17.240" style="s2">reproductive professor our productive</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">communities as Michelle calls it could</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.240" end="00:19:22.030" style="s2">me I mean they could be built on top of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:24.110" style="s2">that to make my own biomedical products</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.030" end="00:19:28.370" style="s2">educational products and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.110" end="00:19:31.100" style="s2">could a capitalist economy here Jeremy</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.370" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">Rifkin talks about so so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.100" end="00:19:35.809" style="s2">all of these things are compatible as</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:37.940" style="s2">long as we have that fundamental basis</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.809" end="00:19:41.000" style="s2">of the Commons and Michelle can talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.940" end="00:19:44.420" style="s2">more about that at the moment as Horace</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.000" end="00:19:47.990" style="s2">commenting around the knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.420" end="00:19:51.290" style="s2">education stuff here the historian who</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.990" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">killed human is a colleague of mine he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.290" end="00:19:56.380" style="s2">the founder of this career center for</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">digital be managed</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.380" end="00:20:00.890" style="s2">he&#39;s working to make the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:04.460" style="s2">knowledge available to students here in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.890" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">Korea in higher education and then of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.460" end="00:20:10.340" style="s2">course moving on to other sectors of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:12.800" style="s2">education of the children and then for</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.340" end="00:20:14.900" style="s2">the rest of Asia there&#39;s a moat plant</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.800" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">find open courses platform that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.900" end="00:20:20.270" style="s2">beginning of this and as they hang out</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:22.250" style="s2">with Bonnie last night she and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.270" end="00:20:26.630" style="s2">discussed this and then what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.250" end="00:20:29.090" style="s2">generation of more simplexity she calls</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.630" end="00:20:31.610" style="s2">it for education and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.090" end="00:20:34.130" style="s2">perhaps she and uncle Kim can talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.610" end="00:20:36.310" style="s2">sometime about that finally I want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.130" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">make a comment about what we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.310" end="00:20:43.850" style="s2">in the near future and I&#39;m very cautious</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:46.730" style="s2">to speak about the future beyond say</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.850" end="00:20:50.990" style="s2">five or ten years specifically for what</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.730" end="00:20:53.330" style="s2">Michelle talked about is the in 20-30 we</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.990" end="00:20:54.890" style="s2">this kind of perfect storm he mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.330" end="00:20:58.190" style="s2">is something that the physicists are</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.890" end="00:20:59.930" style="s2">saying we can&#39;t see beyond what would it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.190" end="00:21:03.080" style="s2">what it means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.930" end="00:21:05.180" style="s2">complexification though things will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.080" end="00:21:06.890" style="s2">to a point that we can&#39;t even predict</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.180" end="00:21:09.710" style="s2">beyond that so whenever you see a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.890" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">government say in 2050 the population</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.710" end="00:21:17.330" style="s2">will be x + sr it totally alone</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:19.370" style="s2">assistive and so I think that salvitore</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.330" end="00:21:21.680" style="s2">is concept here of the near future is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.370" end="00:21:23.930" style="s2">the best that we can do for anything not</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.680" end="00:21:27.830" style="s2">just for education but in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.930" end="00:21:29.420" style="s2">education what we see happening is if</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.830" end="00:21:32.560" style="s2">you think about how much data and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.420" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">information is produced each day</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.560" end="00:21:38.510" style="s2">probably since that maybe in nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:40.670" style="s2">eighty more informations been produced</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.510" end="00:21:43.970" style="s2">than ever in the history of humankind</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.670" end="00:21:46.310" style="s2">and that will become yearly and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.970" end="00:21:48.980" style="s2">every six months every three months and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.310" end="00:21:51.890" style="s2">perhaps even daily more information</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.980" end="00:21:54.830" style="s2">produced than was before nineteen eighty</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.890" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">if you can get an idea this it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.830" end="00:21:59.480" style="s2">going to be possible to process that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:00.980" style="s2">data so what we thinks going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.480" end="00:22:03.580" style="s2">happen is they&#39;re going to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.980" end="00:22:06.680" style="s2">algorithms that we set up that will</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.580" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">interpret the real world for us and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.680" end="00:22:12.150" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need convergence groups</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:14.700" style="s2">that will that can facilitate the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.150" end="00:22:16.770" style="s2">education of students so I call these</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.700" end="00:22:19.890" style="s2">convergence teams or convergence groups</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.770" end="00:22:22.770" style="s2">and they have to have what what they</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.890" end="00:22:25.220" style="s2">used to call multidisciplinary studies</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.770" end="00:22:29.390" style="s2">of what we is called convergence today</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.220" end="00:22:32.340" style="s2">working together to try to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.390" end="00:22:35.700" style="s2">momentum explosion of data and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.340" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">information so incidentally we just</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.700" end="00:22:40.290" style="s2">released a white paper today on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.220" end="00:22:44.040" style="s2">tragedy of Fukushima and the failure of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.290" end="00:22:46.830" style="s2">the technological system and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.040" end="00:22:49.770" style="s2">p2p organized process that began in</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.830" end="00:22:52.050" style="s2">September there was a knowledge open</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.770" end="00:22:54.570" style="s2">knowledge process there were 28</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.050" end="00:22:56.340" style="s2">researchers involved and then the white</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.570" end="00:22:59.550" style="s2">paper something like eighty seven pages</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.340" end="00:23:01.860" style="s2">with and half for phones so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.550" end="00:23:05.400" style="s2">example that we have from p2p foundation</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.860" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">and the Asian Institute and I&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.400" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">here with the fact that I not only on</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.570" end="00:23:17.490" style="s2">how should I say like like Bonnie says</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.820" end="00:23:20.130" style="s2">what was done in the past for education</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.490" end="00:23:21.990" style="s2">is over the whole thing about organizing</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.130" end="00:23:25.320" style="s2">and storing data and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.990" end="00:23:29.880" style="s2">that&#39;s done by machines how will we</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.320" end="00:23:33.990" style="s2">facilitate learning from here on using</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:36.930" style="s2">machines as necessary and so that might</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.990" end="00:23:39.090" style="s2">be my question to you guys and then how</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.930" end="00:23:41.930" style="s2">will it come about that both the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.090" end="00:23:44.580" style="s2">universalized access to commons and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.930" end="00:23:46.980" style="s2">ttp structures that will enter in maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.580" end="00:23:49.110" style="s2">with the cake oien like the debate that</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.980" end="00:23:52.710" style="s2">went on this week so I&#39;ll I&#39;ll in there</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.110" end="00:23:56.250" style="s2">and thanks a lot or all of you being</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.710" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">here it&#39;s so nice to see you all so</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.380" end="00:24:22.669" style="s2">thinking about knowledge is becoming too</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.690" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">big to know</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.669" end="00:24:28.609" style="s2">you know and and this is especially true</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:30.639" style="s2">as we all work toward distributed forms</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.609" end="00:24:33.590" style="s2">of knowledge right i mean we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.639" end="00:24:37.070" style="s2">nahmias knowledge being created too fast</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.590" end="00:24:39.649" style="s2">to kind of capture it but we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.070" end="00:24:42.529" style="s2">working toward distributed knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.649" end="00:24:45.710" style="s2">that&#39;s going to ask you know make this</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.529" end="00:24:49.340" style="s2">problem or opportunity even greater that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.710" end="00:24:51.799" style="s2">knowledge is too big to know so um I</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.340" end="00:24:54.350" style="s2">think and then the other thing is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.799" end="00:24:56.779" style="s2">know when I forgot how you frame the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.350" end="00:24:59.239" style="s2">question lane but so what do what do</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.779" end="00:25:03.259" style="s2">young people need you know what young</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.239" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">people are intuitively aware that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.259" end="00:25:09.289" style="s2">are now facing an unknown and unknowable</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:11.389" style="s2">future I mean this is this is you speak</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.289" end="00:25:13.850" style="s2">to them and you go to workshops and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.389" end="00:25:16.070" style="s2">is what&#39;s definitely inside of them so</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.600" end="00:25:25.820" style="s2">now what kind of navigation tools I</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.999" end="00:25:28.700" style="s2">don&#39;t think we provide them content we</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.820" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">provide them navigation tools and even</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.700" end="00:25:33.710" style="s2">then we have to be humble because these</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:36.379" style="s2">we need to listen to the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.710" end="00:25:39.169" style="s2">their evolving lines for the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.379" end="00:25:41.330" style="s2">you know navigation tools they need for</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.169" end="00:25:43.489" style="s2">where they only don&#39;t know they know</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.299" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">the egg to the father and the father</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.369" end="00:25:52.879" style="s2">changed the eggs to the mothers and then</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.850" end="00:26:13.249" style="s2">this fast and so we need to look for</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.759" end="00:26:15.320" style="s2">natural born leaders coming from that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.249" end="00:26:18.259" style="s2">generation and learn to listen bar</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.320" end="00:26:20.809" style="s2">current work continue to listen for</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.259" end="00:26:23.149" style="s2">educators into the future that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.809" end="00:26:28.129" style="s2">been born in some sense to them so that</p>
