<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">what does consciousness do</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">and the nature or generation problem</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">around physicalism and naturalism i look</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">forward to that and i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">good segue for</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">passing it over to greg to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">himself right actually physical</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">am interested in what i call the problem</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">which gets into what is the science of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">behavior and mental process why is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">been such an unbelievable difficult</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">thing to define with any kind of</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">and some of that also takes me into what</p>

<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">framework</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">uh for mind and matter uh and then i</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">came to learn about john and all of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">wonderful work uh and have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">dogging him ever since uh so that i can</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">learn and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">his model of uh consciousness uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">fits uh in a very very exciting way and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">fills out an enormous amount of richness</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">um and that&#39;s what i&#39;m looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">to teasing out so</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">i&#39;m really really thrilled to be here</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">great</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">hear that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">uh what uh what are we going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">do with this well we</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">are going to try and as i said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:56.799" style="s2">going to really try and tackle</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">these uh interconnected problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.799" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">of the nature and function of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">consciousness but as the subtitle of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">whole series indicates</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">this is particularly why greg is here</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">not only for his expertise on psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">but also because</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">greg like me is very interested on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">existential and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">and we i think i&#39;m going to use this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">very broadly greg will often use it in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">uh specific sense but i&#39;m going to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">it broadly right now an existential and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">ramifications of this coming to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">a a deep a different and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">of the nature of consciousness greg and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">i are both a little bit uncomfortable</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">uh but also but i&#39;ll speak it on our</p>

<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">um we&#39;re interested in what you might</p>

<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">i&#39;d like to start and i propose this to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">greg and he agreed that this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">place to start i&#39;d like to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">with how we got into the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">um so many of you have seen uh</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">the meaning crisis and believe me that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">we will keep coming back to that in the</p>

<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">the two problems are not are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">separable</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">but i want to do something similar and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">get into how did</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">how did consciousness become such a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">for us in particular and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">um there&#39;s a there&#39;s a myriad of places</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">we could start</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">and so really in the interests of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">i&#39;m going to start in a place</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">that i think is sort of optimal for</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">getting us getting our feet on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">ground for this problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s uh that&#39;s descartes response</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:47.039" style="s2">to the scientific revolution because i</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:52.639" style="s2">the arguments that descartes proposes</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">there are three arguments</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.639" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">have laid out our cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">grammar for thinking about mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">and greg is going to develop this later</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">right i&#39;ve laid out the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">cognitive grammar of thinking about mine</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">that we still carry with us today and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">and well we need to get we need to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">this answered why is this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">so attractive</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">but it is also so problematic and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">damaging to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">like so there&#39;s something odd it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like crack it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">attractive right it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">attractive to us it&#39;s almost inescapable</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">and yet we know it and many people much</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">brilliant than myself have pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">how this cartesian framework</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">has been so damaging to us in so many</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">ways and greg is again gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">like really develop that i think for us</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">at length</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">and so what my main thesis is going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">my initial proposal what i&#39;m proposing</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">to greg</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">is that the reason why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">attractive</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">is because of the way that conception of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">the mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">is so deeply bound up with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.800" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">conception of the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">that emerged in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:20.160" style="s2">revolution and because of the success</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">of the scientific worldview we and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.160" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">because it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">inseparably bound up with the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar we are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">attracted to this grammar</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">even though in many ways it is almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">traumatizing to us</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">both collectively and individually so</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">great how what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">brilliant and uh let me rip off that for</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">just a second so</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">um you know as a clinician and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">studies personality one of the things i</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">often notice is uh somebody&#39;s greatest</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">strength is also their greatest weakness</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">right right uh and so i think that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">is something very very enormously</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">appealing and you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">articulate that with good</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">uh you know about this frame it makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">perfect intuitive sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">um i think the connection between the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">frame and the modern scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">revolution is absolutely key</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">and its disaster is key both</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">conceptually and to the larger</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">existential spiritual meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">reside in and so you know in my own work</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve identified what i call the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">gap and the enlightenment gap is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">idea of empirical science had two</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">really difficult problems that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t and no synthetic system was able</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">to resolve</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">one of which is this mind matter problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">and the other is what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">scientific knowledge relative to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">socially constructed knowledge right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">how do we crisply differentiate those</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">and we see the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">post-modernism really as</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">especially in the second one but we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">the problem of psychology in the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">okay all right and so here we can say</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">descartes one of the fathers although</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">galileo generally is called the father</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">of modern science but</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">um descartes one of the fathers clearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">to giving us the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">with with such richness i i through your</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">work i&#39;ve come to appreciate how</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">sophisticated i sort of give descartes a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">short shrift in my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">writing historically he&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">person and gives where i knew he did was</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">that but his his</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">work on the mind and consciousness was</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">really rich</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">much richer than i was aware of so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">gives us</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">an opportunity to move into it thank you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">greg that was uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">that&#39;s a that uh first of all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">bringing out those two problems i just</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">want to acknowledge that that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">uh the the uh the sort of the mind body</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">problem as it&#39;s traditionally called</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">and then the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">and socially constructed knowledge i</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s really that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">um and that of course has been the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">tortured relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">the hard sciences and the humanities or</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">the hard sciences of the social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see as we go along that those</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">problems as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">intimating are deeply interconnected um</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">i like what you also mentioned there</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:03.440" style="s2">about galileo and uh dave carnell talk a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">little bit about that in the history</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">one of the things i find about descartes</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:10.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which he is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">responding to the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">crisis being caused by the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">and and it&#39;s no coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">that he labeled one of his most</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">important he titled sorry one of his</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">most important works</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">the meditations because he is alluding</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">to marcus aurelius&#39;s meditations</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">which are a series of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">exercises because he&#39;s trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">people uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">uh he&#39;s trying to give people an</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">existential response</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">to the way their world was being torn</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">asunder by the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">and unfortunately that existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">aspect of descartes work is also</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">uh tended to be uh not properly</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">remembered and so we&#39;re gonna try and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">remember it we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">respond to that and remember it</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">throughout what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">did you want to say anything more before</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">we i propose sort of the first argument</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">yeah no no that i think we&#39;re ready then</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:05.279" style="s2">to set so that so this</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">setup is um you know here we are in</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.279" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">the emergence of modernist thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">science is happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">uh descartes gets his cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">coordinates so all of a sudden we start</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">to mathematically map</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:16.959" style="s2">behavior and change in particular ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">of course galileo&#39;s doing that and now</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.959" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">this whole issue of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">the dual world history into a mono world</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">reality um so yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">on the edge of the seat we&#39;re excited</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">this is fun to be doing this together</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">with you i really appreciate that so</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">what i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">is i&#39;m going to take a look at what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">consider descartes three core arguments</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">um not because i&#39;m trying to convince</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">about the conclusion of these arguments</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">not at all in fact uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">in a very real sense i&#39;m not convinced</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">by their</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">by them right but i want to show you</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">um i want to bring all us together into</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">a proper respect for these arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">so that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">we can get a deep understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">of the issue we&#39;re facing i talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">in my work elsewhere about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">importance of problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to step back and spend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">of time really carefully</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">excavating right and explicating</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">your problem formulation if they turn if</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">you if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">if you get a sense that you&#39;re bashing</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">your head against the problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">that means stop trying to solve it</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">you do some heavy work at getting clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">about the problem formulation so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to do right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">amen and there and there are few uh more</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">difficult but more important things to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">get our handle on</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">in the problem if we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">consciousness the language games are</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">you know just enormous exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">so the first argument</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">um i&#39;m not i&#39;m not going to be citing</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">descartes like word for word or verbatim</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to present the gist of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">argument um so the first argument</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">is is basically runs along these lines</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">and again i&#39;m not going to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">getting this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">um sort of technically logically</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">precisely valid</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">right we&#39;ll try to put our academic</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">training on the back end and just talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">like normal people</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">as much as possible right which is hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">for us people i</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">appreciate that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">so the first argument goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">take a look at the properties of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">mind and we&#39;ll come back later to why</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">descartes zeroes in on these properties</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">take a look at the properties of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">mind the mind has</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">what&#39;s called intentionality okay what</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">does that mean that means</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">my mental states are about they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">directed at</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">they refer to things other than</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">um and material objects don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">this pencil is not about anything else</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">my thought about the pencil might be</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">but the pencil itself is not about</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">anything else doesn&#39;t refer to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:56.639" style="s2">it just is in itself it has causal</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">interactions with other things but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.639" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">nothing like intentionality and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:03.199" style="s2">closely related to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">is mind mind is a place where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.199" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">and and this is a this is the second of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">the heart problem so i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">say too much about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to rely on your intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">sense that you for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">are getting the meaning of what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">saying right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s meaningful to you and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">many things your environment makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">to you it&#39;s meaningful to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">and so and but</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:30.959" style="s2">material things obviously things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">mean anything to this pencil</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.959" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make any sense to us in fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">if you had an experience where you</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">seriously thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">things were meaning being meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">the pencil like you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">like you&#39;d you&#39;d be questioning your</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">sanity you&#39;d be checking me out in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">licensed sort of way</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">yes exactly well good okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">and then related to that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">your you you are oriented towards truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:57.519" style="s2">and i say something</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">real fast about that because this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.519" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">important meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">is in many ways automatic you see a red</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">cup and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">you intuit the affordances of this cup</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">the the machinery and we can talk i know</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">some more of that but highlight how</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">robust meaning comes to you simply</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">through your</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">perceptual awareness yeah we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">come back to this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">right one of one of my major proposals</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">that a a deep way of trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">this meaning that will connect it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">consciousness is through the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">relevance realization and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">greg is</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">alluding to right now uh and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">gonna come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">and so uh to continue uh my uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">i can evaluate uh my ideas or my</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:42.079" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">in terms of whether they&#39;re true or</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.079" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">false again material things aren&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">or false</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">they just are and for think about how</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">strange this is how much does truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">weigh</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">what&#39;s its color how big is it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">these are all just absurd things to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.440" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">so you can see that there are these deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">of of mind and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">matter seems to be completely lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">and then when we take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">properties of matter</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">well you know it seems to have extension</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">it has resistance right it has</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">force physical force and of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">mental states don&#39;t have they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">extended</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">right they don&#39;t have anything like</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">inertial resistance what would that mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">right they don&#39;t have energetic force</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.880" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">and you&#39;ll say but my ideas are forceful</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">you&#39;re using a metaphor you&#39;re using a</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">metaphor and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">we&#39;re going to come back to why do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">want to use those kinds of metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">right so what descartes noted was</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">he said well look mind seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">properties that are completely lacking</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">in matter</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">and matter seems to have properties that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">are completely lacking in mind and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">he drew this conclusion mind and matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">are two</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">separate independently existing</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">substances</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">this is known as cartesian dualism that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">reality is made up of two</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">okay and so why is this first of all</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">many people carry around many people</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">have very confused ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">mind and body um and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">between mind and brain and we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">back to that too</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">but many people do have and carry around</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">a kind of implicit dualism because</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">again this has become very prevalent in</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">our culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see that descartes model got</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">integrated with a particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">interpretation of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">that also wove it into a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">religious uh framework so it has</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">huge consequences so</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">what&#39;s the first thing to say about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">argument well let&#39;s go carefully with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">first of all the argument is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">technically a valid argument a valid</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">argument is one in which</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">the premises of the argument necessitate</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">the conclusion so if you accept the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">premises</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">you must on pain of logical</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">inconsistency</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">a lot a deductive argument yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">so the pro why is it not technically</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">valid because in order for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">technically valid</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">the list of features has to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:28.559" style="s2">exhaustive it has to be complete</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">so if descartes looks at three or four</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.559" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">properties what if the next 100</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">properties are shared by mind and matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">then adar&#39;s argument loses all of its</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">force right it loses all of its force</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">and you say well but maybe descartes got</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">them all he clearly did not</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">so now and this is going to be an</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">important move we have to set this</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">argument into its historical context</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">descartes for example was not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">unconscious cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">most of us now understand that a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">feature of your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">is that most of it happens unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">descartes did not have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">as a future of mine right he did not</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">have many of the features that we now</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">attribute to matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">he thought of matter almost as equal to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">extension many of the properties</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">we now assign to matter like energy and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">other baker did not</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">know that so his list is clearly clearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">not exhaustive or complete so right away</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not technically valid</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">right and and let me just say uh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">introducing two super important concepts</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">that are going to be crucial for us when</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">you get into the 20th century and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">ultimately 21st century for the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">language game</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">okay so the energy matter difference and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">and relation</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">all right through uh james cork maxwell</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">and then ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.559" style="s2">quantum mechanics and general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">that&#39;s unbelievably key</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.559" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">okay and the other thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">cognition versus consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">distinction yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">yes yes so those are both now diff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">creating language systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">actually now</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">creating much more uh ticked rich</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">texture</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">in allowing us to narrate the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">excellent thank you great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.360" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">so one way we could try and steal man</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.360" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">descartes right on his behalf is we</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">could say okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">but what descartes has found are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">essential properties</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">mind and matter so even if his list is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">not exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">at least he has the essential properties</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">and therefore we could restructure the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">argument as</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">there&#39;s an essential difference between</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">mind and matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">and that at least makes it probable that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">mind and matter might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">different substances okay that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">enough the problem is again</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">um claiming that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">the descartes of the essence of matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">is clearly false</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">um uh as as drake just said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">there&#39;s lots more that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">turned out to be essential so he does</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">not have the essence</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">he&#39;s claiming that we have the essence</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:56.080" style="s2">of mind as greg is going to make really</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">clear uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.080" end="00:21:01.919" style="s2">we can&#39;t agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">i mean a lot of breaks work in fact is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.919" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">wrestling with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">that we can&#39;t agree on</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">like i mean academically culturally we</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">have no consensus</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">greg is laboring to try and bring about</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">this consensus</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">and he has to label in such a you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">heroic fashion precisely because there</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">so such a lack of consensus</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:29.039" style="s2">about what the mental is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">fragmented pluralistic landscape</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.039" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">yes with with no grounding there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">meta grounding</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">that allows a paradigmatic realization</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s just it&#39;s just everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">different starting points different</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">emphases</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">uh it&#39;s very dramatic and and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">starting points have people get anchored</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">and uh so yeah that&#39;s why it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">task</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">so many people um in fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">this is this is a technical problem in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s called the mark of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">mental</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to figure out even not even</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">the essence but even</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">a distinguishing mark of the mental that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">will pick it out reliably</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">um so although we have intuitions uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">those intuitions don&#39;t reliably guide us</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">to an essence</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">and here&#39;s where you know here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">again it intersects with science because</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">there&#39;s an argument by twine that says</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">largely one way of interpreting and i</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">think this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">a valuable thing to note about science</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">what science does is it finds those</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">categories that do have an essence</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">because when you find a category that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">has an essence you can make broad</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">and deep generalizations inductive</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">generalizations</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s what science is in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">business of doing and of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">well we might say that physics has made</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">a lot of progress towards that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">uh it&#39;s very questionable that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">has made a similar progress towards</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">producing</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">uh that kind of scientific success so</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">we we are not currently historically in</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">the place</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">where we could safely reconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">descartes argument as</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">here are the essential properties of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">mind here are the essential properties</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">of matter</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">and therefore draw the conclusion okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:08.799" style="s2">so what do we get so so well that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.799" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">we just disposed of descartes right well</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">verveiki just disposed to descartes and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">it&#39;s all solved and it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">okay so the point we have the thing we</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">have to ask ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">if this is not a deductively valid</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">why is it such a powerfully persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">argument and let&#39;s acknowledge the fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">that most of the good</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">arguments in science are not deductive</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">arguments in the first place okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">so here&#39;s the point i want to make i</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">wanna i</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">am proposing that what descartes does i</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think descartes thought he was</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">i&#39;m proposing a way to explain</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">why his arguments are so persuasive even</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">though they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">deductively valid is that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">doing we can reconstruct his argument as</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">an inference to the best explanation</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">that descartes argument best explains</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">right he comes up with a way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">explaining the mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">that makes the best sense of the mind in</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">terms of the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:18.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s precisely because of that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">his view is so successful</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">so what i&#39;m doing right from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">beginning is wedding the success</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">of his argument to the success of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">what do you think about that i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely correct and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">although maybe i i don&#39;t have quite the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">appreciation for the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">descartes and say the catholic church</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">i certainly want to say that remember</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">modernist thinking is coming off of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">formal</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">uh scholastic academic tradition which</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">is dual world</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">okay so and if you have an embedded dual</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">world this mind body dualism is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">is part and parcel to your understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">you die and your soul goes to heaven if</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">we think about it in concrete terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">you you fall asleep there&#39;s your body</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">your mind is wherever it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">you know and then you wake back up your</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:06.159" style="s2">mind&#39;s back in action when you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.159" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">so so we can empathize right away</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:13.840" style="s2">with the intersection of christianity um</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:15.320" style="s2">and dual world the idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.840" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">some sort of enlighten you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.320" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">breath-giving soul that lights you up</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">uh that is separable from your body is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:24.159" style="s2">embedded in the grammar that comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">before in the western</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.159" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">european tradition here yes um and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:29.679" style="s2">and then it&#39;s going to become this</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">psychological middle ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.679" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">even if descartes doesn&#39;t argue it in</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">terms of i talk a lot about how people</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">justify</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">you know so the idea that we can take</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">descartes and basically like okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">believe in this matter in motion stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">but we still have a mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">separable for many people</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">uh maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">elegant philosophical solution but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">will create a psychological solution of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">like oh okay we can believe in science</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:55.520" style="s2">and still have our christian</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">version of reality i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.520" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">excellent um thank you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">so i want to pick up so yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">there&#39;s very much of two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">mythology</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">um that we&#39;ve inherited uh from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">ancient world and through the medieval</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">that greg&#39;s right that&#39;s in there uh and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">um part of the attraction of descartes</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">yeah uh part of the attraction uh of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">descartes argument is precisely how it</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">not only</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">is uh enmeshed with the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">it allows it we it</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">it re-languages christianity so that for</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">a while it has a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">within that emerging scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">worldview so</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.840" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">perfect okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">so if how does let&#39;s just do a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">quick thing on infants to the best</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">explanation how does it work</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">uh and this is and the point about this</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">is descartes is playing fair i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">i would argue and uh many people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">many people in philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">would argue that most of science works</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">entrance to the best explanation so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">let&#39;s i i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">so yeah so let&#39;s do it by an example</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">here&#39;s a very important scientific</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">theory uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:16.240" style="s2">the darwin&#39;s theory of evolution so</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the issue well we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.240" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">some phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">seems to demand from us explanation</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">creatures seem to be really well</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">designed in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">their morphology and their behavior</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">seems to be really well fitted to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">environment that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">in how did that happen right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">and we care about this because it has</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">implications for us</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">uh and so deep implications for us okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">you you can look around and now i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">paley who comes before darwin</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">well i can look around you know how does</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">how do some things get their shape</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">well you know sand dunes get their shape</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">by the wind blowing</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">oh well maybe the wind blows enough then</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">it will make a goat</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t seem right okay i thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">that seems very very implausible</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">well you know maybe well sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">lightning strikes and it starts a fire</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">well maybe lightning strikes and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">cites a particular kind of fire because</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">goats are warm</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you get a goat and notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">how you&#39;re probably finding these</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">proposals ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">and then you get well it&#39;s paley says</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">think about this i come across a watch</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:23.200" style="s2">and the watch is really complex</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">and compared to all these other</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.200" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">explanations here&#39;s a good explanation</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">how the watch came into existence</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">there&#39;s an intelligent designer that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">made it and so compared to the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">explanations</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">we conclude because the explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">the intelligent designer</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">explains more and more precisely</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.120" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">than the other two and gives us you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">tighter fit between our explanations of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">we conclude that that&#39;s the case so</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">we put we have our we have our our</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">we put a bunch of explanations into</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">competition and the one that does the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">best job we conclude that the entities</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">that are proposed in it must therefore</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">the intelligent designer for example now</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">darwin comes along and this shows you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">something about inference to the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">explanation there are they are always</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">historically relative</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">because there&#39;s always more possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">explanations</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">always always darwin comes along</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">and he comes up with an alternative you</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">basically natural selection and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">thing about darwin is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">his theory is a better explanation why</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">is it better</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">because he can explain not only really</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">good design but he can</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">explain really really crappy design like</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">you know why is our back have this weird</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">stupid s-curve in it</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">well because we have all done quadrupeds</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">um why do we have these wisdom teeth</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">very not functional right well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">because we have all right</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">and so he why does you know famously you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">know google the panda&#39;s thumb why</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:03.039" style="s2">doesn&#39;t the panda have a good thumb</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">why because right and so descartes</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.039" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">he can explain both good design and bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">and he can evoke entities that we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">observe</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">right he can we can observe competition</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">between animals</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">we can observe sexual reproduction or</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">just reproduction in general</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">so he has he</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">explains more phenomena in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">mechanisms for which we have more direct</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">so his proposal is the best</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s why many people myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">included i know greg is too</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:36.159" style="s2">think that this is the explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.159" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">you know organic creatures came to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">now notice</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">and this is actually happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">because people are now</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.880" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">and i mean within biology i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">crackpots people within biology are</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">challenging darwin&#39;s account</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:52.320" style="s2">and saying you know even the grand</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">right has to be revised dennis walsh</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">a friend and colleague of mine is doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">fantastic work on this a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">because i&#39;ve got ideas about that but</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll spare you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">so the point is when it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">beats out the competition we conclude</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">but we often we often forget that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">inference to the best explanation is</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">historically relative</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">right if you before darwin if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:25.840" style="s2">in intelligent design you were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">an idiot right</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.840" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">but after darwin it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">believe in intelligent design</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where that&#39;s where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">at okay so what i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll make a quick plug here for</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">justification systems theory so</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">justification systems theory does</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.039" style="s2">say that our ideas for what isn&#39;t ought</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.039" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">exist in a socio-historical context and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">justification is a key functional</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">dynamic so it just basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">if you have that frame you always are</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">then situating whatever justificatory</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">frame you have in its history yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s oh this is wonderful having you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">here greg that&#39;s a great connection</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">and put those two together that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">interesting so you what your</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">point greg is proposing make sure i</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">understand you greg he&#39;s proposing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">the epistemic strategy of inference to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">the best explanation</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">is bound up with the social cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">of justification which actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">the cultural sphere did i understand you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">correctly yeah and actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:25.679" style="s2">when you get when you get used to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">language of justification it just</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:29.600" style="s2">it permeates everything so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">well i&#39;m justifying myself in a context</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.600" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">of justification and creates all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:35.679" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">loops um but yeah that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.679" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">okay so what i want to do um is i want</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">do so i tried to convince you that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">descartes argument</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">is an influence of the best explanation</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">our approach to it has to be properly</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">historical and what that means is we</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">have to look at descartes time</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">at the competing explanations that were</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">on offer</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">and why did descartes model win out over</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">the competing explanations</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">and and let&#39;s remember that the arena</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">of the competition is the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:12.880" style="s2">and as greg has reminded us it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">the arena of the catholic church</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.880" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">in crisis because the protestant</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">reformation has occurred for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">yes of course okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.799" style="s2">so what is on offer so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">what&#39;s on offer is the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.799" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">official main competitor</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">right right so when you read sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">standard textbooks</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">uh the official main competitor is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">worldview and this was</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">uh undergoing uh something of a a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">powerful collapse</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">and this was not a trivial affair uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">because the aristotelian worldview had</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">been in</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">existence for had been dominant uh for</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">1800 years kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a long time and it had</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">inseminated uh catholic theology like</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">thomas aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">had deeply stitched uh christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">the aristotelian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">uh together and the educational system</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">the scholastic tradition that greg</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">was deeply woven with aristotelian ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">learning and the cultivation of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">so right this was this was the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">so a good thing to ask is what was the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">scientific revolution revolting against</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">it was revolting against the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">aristotelian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">right and the uh again if you for to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">get a more complex view of that i refer</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">people to some of the episodes from</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">awakening for the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:43.919" style="s2">go ahead greg i&#39;ll i&#39;ll make a quick</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">comment here because actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.919" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">what i&#39;m really interested in is just in</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">this it gets back to some of my stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">i won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">onto but actually there&#39;s an explosion</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">what i would call pure lame metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">okay around the 15th century all right</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">16th century</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:01.359" style="s2">if you do purely metaphysics everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:04.240" style="s2">is tautological</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.359" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">okay uh so it&#39;s so you get aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.240" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">combined with the catholic church and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">then on steroids</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">where that where you can&#39;t and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">galileo hates that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:15.760" style="s2">so galileo&#39;s empiricism isn&#39;t defined</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.760" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">metaphysics gone wild we should do a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">video on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">metaphysics gone wild no so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s in that tradition so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">tradition is collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually going to come back</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">because i actually think that we do a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">disservice to metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">at least the natural modern empirical</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:36.079" style="s2">science doesn&#39;t realize that you need a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">descriptive metaphysics for your</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.079" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">so anyway that&#39;s uh and i i i&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">argue there&#39;s aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">aristotle or that come back oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">especially at the issues of life mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">and culture when we get into final and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">uh uh formal causation i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">you want to get into that but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">whole another excitement</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">well we will so so</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna like i said let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">what was lost</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">uh what was being lost in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">revolution what was being</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">uh dispensed with in from the aristotel</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">world view</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:14.640" style="s2">uh so uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">a useful way to look at how people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.640" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">living their metaphysics is in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">their worldview</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">and a worldview some of you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.320" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">this argument from elsewhere it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">up of two components</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">a model of the world and a model of your</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">viewing your knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">of the world knowing broadly construed</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">and they have to mutually support each</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">other in a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">very powerful fashion and like craig uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">just said</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">that can that can degenerate into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">of empty tautology</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">kind of thing greg wasn&#39;t saying that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">worldview was itself a tautology no no</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">but that attunement can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">misappropriated as a empty kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">tautology</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">so um what&#39;s the theory of viewing the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">theory of viewing is the conformity</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">again i&#39;m not going to go into this</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">detail you can take a look at some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">the videos from</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll put links in the notes we can go to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:07.839" style="s2">specific extended arguments about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">from awakening for the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.839" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">but the basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">is that what makes something</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">is its structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">and that what i do when i know something</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:22.320" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">my mind actually takes on the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">as the thing so</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">shape is only a metaphor for structural</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:32.160" style="s2">functional organization if you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">integrate</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.160" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">uh our ideas of shape with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.480" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">a chemical structure or a biological</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">structure you&#39;re getting closer to what</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about when i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">structural functional organization but</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">i&#39;ll use shape</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">as a metaphor for structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">and so my in my hand my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">my hand and we use the word grasp for</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">knowing i grasp something or i</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">comprehend it my hand literally takes on</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">shape it takes on the same structural</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">as the thing it possesses so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">deep identity between my mind</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">and the thing that is known this is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">is called the conformity theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">so i want you to notice the deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">connectedness the intimacy even</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">the identification between the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">what is known yep okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:30.560" style="s2">so that is actually being destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">and so most of us don&#39;t think of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">what did the science what was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">scientific revolution doing well</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">the the scientific revolution was</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">challenging the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">that our mind had this intimate even uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">identification with intimate connection</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">and into</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">identification with why because</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">aristotle had said this is how you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">tell</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">if your mind is in conformity you do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">do a bunch of checks you make sure the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">relevant organ is functioning</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">you make sure the medium that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">operating in is not distorting and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">make sure you have interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">and this is what we do in our day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">lives but we want to know if something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">i want to make sure are my glasses clean</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">right is is it foggy or</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">or did you see that too bob and susan oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">all right that&#39;s gonna get that</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">correspondence going</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">yeah exactly and so and now aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">said now</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">he didn&#39;t mean just sort of like uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">you know whimsical or everyday sense he</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">you do it you know really you you do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">very philosophically you do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">rational reflection in the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">and you do all this very careful work</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">and then after you pass those three</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:41.680" style="s2">tests</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">then you know that the form in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.680" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">and the form in the world are conformed</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:50.160" style="s2">and then copernicus copernicus comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:50.160" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">and we&#39;ll come back to copernicus later</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">but what&#39;s he what&#39;s he doing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:40:01.760" style="s2">you know what we can all get up</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">we&#39;re stone cold sober our eyes are all</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.760" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">20 20 vision</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a clear day there&#39;s a bunch of us</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking and we&#39;re making sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">we&#39;re checking with each other and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">see the sun rise in the east pass</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">overhead and set in the west and we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">all wrong right we&#39;re all wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">in fact and why did he say that so</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2">remember this</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">he said that because as he said it</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.640" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">because putting the sun at the center</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">and having the earth go around it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">turn on its axis</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">made the math work better we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">so what&#39;s what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">copernicus and then galileo say rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">than experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">being the moment of conformity</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">experience is</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">actually something that fails us from</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">it blinds us to the world we need the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">math to get through the veil</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:02.920" style="s2">to get to the thing and so what is born</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">is the idea that knowing happens through</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.920" end="00:41:07.599" style="s2">representation i have to have something</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">that because the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.599" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">is not present to my mind in conformity</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">i have to have</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">some other thing that represents it</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">the world to my mind exactly so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">we get this idea that the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">inherently representational and it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">cut off from the world and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">most of experience is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">illusory in some important fashion</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">so i&#39;ll stop there for a second give</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">greg a chance to uh interject and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">respond</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:41.599" style="s2">yes i mean i i will certainly we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">suggest that this idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.599" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">is present certainly in the greeks if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:46.880" style="s2">go to plato and think about the allegory</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">of the cave there&#39;s allusion to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">notion that we are suggesting about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">mind representation</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">but the break with what um</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">you know the copernican world view uh is</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">you know people just hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">about it you know it&#39;s really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">remarkable not to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">but really the idea was that the heavens</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">had to conform</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:08.319" style="s2">to perfect circles of our earth and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">know of our mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.319" end="00:42:11.599" style="s2">um so the earth shattering nature of of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">uh heliocentric transition is really</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">remarkable and it does set the stage</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">for an enormous profound justification</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">dilemma of like well what is the ground</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">upon which we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">uh legitimizing uh because and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">your story about this narrative i just</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">want people to realize how</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">world view foundational shaking it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">um when when that conformity thing slips</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">and people now are like well wait a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">minute maybe we&#39;re all bs you know this</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.560" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">would come back to</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2">uh renee descartes evil demon you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">in relationship to what</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">the possibility of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">well said so notice what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:55.599" style="s2">here the on one the mind is withdrawing</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">into itself from the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.599" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">what&#39;s happening on the other side what</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">was the model of the world and greg</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">already pointed to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">under aristotle it&#39;s a geocentric world</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">view because what is the structure of my</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">the structure of my experiences i&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">the center and things are moving around</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">me and they seem to be moving in perfect</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">circles</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">right and all of that falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">and it falls apart because what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">getting much better measurements</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">much better and we&#39;re getting much</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">better math and algebra is coming in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">uh from the arab world and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">right and we&#39;re seeing that the heavens</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">mars is doing this weird retrograde and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">things are just behaving strangely</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">and as i mentioned copernicus said well</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:41.119" style="s2">if we put the sun at the center the math</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2">works better</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.119" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">and so mathematical representations</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:48.720" style="s2">are now going to be much more</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:51.520" style="s2">trustworthy than all of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.720" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">right stop and pause because think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.520" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">what that means for consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">already you go from thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">consciousness as something</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">that is putting you in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">to being something that&#39;s somehow in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">because all of this of which unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">all of this qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">structured meaningful experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">not out there</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s not mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">measurable</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not there it&#39;s not there all so</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:22.400" style="s2">for example in aristotle&#39;s worldview</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.640" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">things are moving on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.400" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">everything is moving on purpose because</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">everything every element is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">to where it belongs everything is moving</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">but galileo discovers immersion inertial</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">things aren&#39;t moving on purpose they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">think about what&#39;s at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">word inertia inert</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">lifeless purposeless dead right</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">so everything is moving not on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2">and now the fact that we move on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">is again</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.040" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">well we&#39;re it&#39;s not like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:56.640" style="s2">what everything else is doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">we&#39;re now doing something really weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.640" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">and unique</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">that seems to be and what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">you see i keep doing it with my hands</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">we go from the mind and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">consciousness being a way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">affined and identified to the world to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.560" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">no no all of these properties are</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">actually withdrawing and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">in the subject they&#39;re exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">subjective</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">right here right and all that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">there is what the math</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">represents to me the mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.960" style="s2">properties are the real are the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">properties in the object</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.960" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">so so this is unbelievably crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">understand the dilemma that we&#39;re in i</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">often refer to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">as the modernist empirical and we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">get into this word empiricals a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">interesting word because it used to mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">basically first person experience and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:47.359" style="s2">then it means</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">exterior third-person measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.359" end="00:45:50.319" style="s2">observation in the science switch so</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a switch</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:56.480" style="s2">and what the science then stops doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">is it it it becomes unbelievably suspect</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.480" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">of the subject</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">okay i often call it the anti-knower and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">what i mean by this the anti-subjective</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">bias knower that tries to get to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">objectivity so it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">cross out that subjective perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">and give rise to a general observer</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">third person view</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">how do you do that through mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">logic measurement</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">and a gen some sort of generic observer</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">that interprets that measurement so we</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">are so we&#39;re really transforming</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">um our epistemology here very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">profoundly excellent</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">so let&#39;s pick up on that so notice</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:37.839" style="s2">what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">copernicus isn&#39;t trying to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.839" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">about the mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to solve a problem of making</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">of the new sciences understanding</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">emerging new sciences understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">the heavens</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">and yet that immediately ramifies into</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">grammar that galileo is going to develop</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">that craig just talked about</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">of the subjective and objective and all</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">of these properties that were</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">previously in the world are now</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">withdrawing into the mind and are being</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">regarded as illusory</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">and only subjective in existence you see</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">the very project of like the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">driving us into a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">of thinking about the world and the mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">that is pulling them apart and setting</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">them against each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">which is very opposite to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">aristotelian view</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">that had them deeply conforming and</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">mutually</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">defining of each other so</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">can we let&#39;s just for the if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">thinking to connect this back to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">you know our i mean obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">other philosophy going on here but our</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">foundational epistemological oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:51.359" style="s2">what truth</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">is okay it&#39;s now cutting out the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.359" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">subjective knower</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">and the meaning that it represents about</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">okay so this is a very very profound</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">element of what the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">mentality is going to mean downstream</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">in terms of what we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">dealing with so i just let the viewer</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">think about the implications of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">i want to i want to riff on that a sec</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">it&#39;s also desiccating the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">yeah well oh yeah it leaves the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">desiccated also</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:25.040" style="s2">um and so we are cut out from</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">the scientific world view that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.040" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">sort of this direction that greg pointed</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">to and i&#39;m also pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:32.480" style="s2">we can&#39;t we can&#39;t find ourselves at home</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">in that world</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:36.480" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t have any of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">properties that make our experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.480" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">make our experience meaningful to us in</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">any deep fashion</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.319" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">amen but and this is actually going back</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">to galileo</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">and what he takes from aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">metaphysics in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">empirical uh substance and efficient or</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">really kinetic cause</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">okay and he&#39;s going to kill formal and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">final causation that&#39;s exactly what i</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.800" style="s2">was going to move into next</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:59.920" style="s2">so maybe so what is also happening as</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.800" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">like just said</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.920" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">is like the kind uh so</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:12.800" style="s2">galileo basically we we</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">we think of this as so natural that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">you do science by doing math think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">you like</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">and we graph and we do there is no math</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">in aristotelian science</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">there&#39;s no math they had math the greeks</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">invented mathematics it&#39;s not like they</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t they invented formal mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">they had it they had formal logic</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">aristotle invents it so they had it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">but the idea that you do science by</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">applying math</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not in the aristotelian world</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">view but galileo</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">does this and then he proposes that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">because of what copernicus says is i can</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">use the math</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">in order to overcome the way in which my</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">experience is so deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">right i can use the map and what i have</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">to do is i have to set up the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">so i can mathematically measure and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">manipulate it</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">because that&#39;s the way in which i will</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">overcome the self-deception and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">where you start to get the experimental</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:10.800" style="s2">you start to get the experimental method</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">development and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.800" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">as greg said when you do this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">that as the conform as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">gap is opening up and as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:24.079" style="s2">that what is our primary connection to</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.079" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">all of these properties notice what</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">properties of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">are being removed purpose and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">and so and galileo is discovering</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">inertial motion</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">and so he thinks that the only way</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">things happen is through contact</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">efficient causation</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">things this is the billiard ball model</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">they have to bang</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">things have to con so notice what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">happening here</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">right is that the that the only</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:51:01.119" style="s2">way in which they can understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">causation is through things because the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.119" end="00:51:04.960" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">because things are inert there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.960" end="00:51:09.359" style="s2">dynamic to them because all purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">meaning has been removed to them</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.359" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">the only way they can interact is by</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">inertially</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:16.640" style="s2">smashing into each other right matter in</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">motion yeah so we get</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.640" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">the essence of this matter in motion</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">where we can independently observe with</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">entities and their change and now and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:27.359" style="s2">now that says now this becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">conceptual grammar the lens through</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.359" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">we will make sense of the material world</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:34.800" style="s2">and then the question is well where</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">is that everything right and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.800" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">going to get into this well</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">but there&#39;s this other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.160" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">so let&#39;s try and gather together</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:47.440" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got is we&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:49.839" style="s2">conformity theory</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:52.720" style="s2">and the geocentric worldview and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.839" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">made so many of the properties</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.720" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">of the world actually estranged from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">and then we have to house them into this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:02.800" style="s2">new conception of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">as this self-enclosed separate substance</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.800" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">that is actually cut off from reality</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">and that can only get you through</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">reality uh through</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">math and through mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">and that the only thing therefore it can</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">in the world the only real relations</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">that things have to each other the only</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">only real causal uh relation that exists</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">are things physically coming into</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">contact with each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">banging into each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">okay what else happens there</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">well this was a i i was i was fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">as an undergraduate to study with albert</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">shalom and he made this argument</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">about the loss of the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:50.240" style="s2">worldview a further consequence of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">which is the function of the mind um</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.240" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">the mind used to this is going to this</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">is going to be the hardest part</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">um what used to be called the mind it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really the mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">but in aristotle you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">the mind was basically the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">development of the structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:11.040" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">so mine&#39;s job was to</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.040" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">actualize the potential of matter so</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">aristotle had a notion of matter but</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">it&#39;s very different from odds</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">so for aristotle it&#39;s helpful to use the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:24.079" style="s2">greek word for matter hulei</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">which originally meant wood right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">aristotle said well</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">from the same block of wood i could make</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">a chair or a table</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">or i might make a small ship right</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:39.359" style="s2">and so the wood is potentially a chair</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">or a table what makes it actually a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.359" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">or a chair is how it&#39;s structurally</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">functionally organized</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">it has been informed a particular form</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">has been put into it so that it acts in</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">so matter is potential that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">actualized by structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.960" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">and then living creatures and especially</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:04.960" style="s2">mental creatures have a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:05.839" style="s2">capacity for actualization and so the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.960" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">mind for</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.839" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">aristotle is that about us which at many</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:12.000" style="s2">level is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">actualizing the potential of our body</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.000" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">and our interaction</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">so the mind is actually a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:21.839" style="s2">actualizer of all of the potentiality</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">that is given to you</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.839" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">yep so and and so we can say actually so</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">you know in his word is psyche by the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">way okay that really is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">soul but it&#39;s the functional form of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">entities</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">all right and then i get all excited</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">because he&#39;s going to put this on a</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:39.119" style="s2">scale of natura</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">right and then he&#39;s going to say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.119" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">inanimate functional forms and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">vegetative functional forms and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">there&#39;s animal functional forms</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">and then they&#39;re rational personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">functional forms if you know tree of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">knowledge matter life mind and culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a lot of overlap in</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">relationship to there but</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">so he is thinking about functional form</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:00.960" style="s2">uh at these different</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">levels of nature and that really</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">mine he don&#39;t really have the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">of the term mind he has this functional</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:09.040" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">that jumps off of the material plane and</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.040" end="00:55:13.359" style="s2">gets into the vegetative</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">animal and rational planes right</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.359" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">and as you&#39;re going up the scale of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">actualization you&#39;re coming into</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">entities that are more and more capable</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">yes of actualizing them right have more</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">you know functional structural forms and</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">you know uh more and more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">so you have this whole model of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">an engine of dynamical development and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:41.280" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">right which actually isn&#39;t a bad model</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.280" end="00:55:44.480" style="s2">and here&#39;s the thing we lose that this</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">is shalom&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.480" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">we lose that when the aristotelian view</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">is lost and so we lose</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">the job of mind being inherently</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">connected to development</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:58.000" style="s2">and emergence we lose the function of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">mind as being inherently connected</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.000" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">to development and emergence so now the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">mind is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">not only isolated it doesn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">any important relationship to the body</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not actualizing the body</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">and it is not inherently in development</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.599" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">it is just</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">an epistemic engine its only job is to</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:19.359" style="s2">represent the world as mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">accurately as possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.359" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">brilliant brilliant i&#39;ll make a quick</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">point here</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">i i&#39;ve detailed in depth uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">john watson you know a famous</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">behaviorist</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">and he has a footnote he basically says</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">to the extent there&#39;s any problem of</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a philosophical problem to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">legitimize epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:42.000" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what he says he&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">know because he has this neural network</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.000" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">reflex model that reduces to all this</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">mechanical stuff so he&#39;s like to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.839" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem of just philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">epistemology about what an observation</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.920" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">and how do you legitimize it so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">really cool about how much he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">internalized that as a behavior you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">the raw behaviorism right internalizes</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:01.680" style="s2">this and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">he still has to see somehow cautious</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.680" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">plays a role well he skirted it all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">way up</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:08.400" style="s2">to the problem of epistemology and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:10.400" style="s2">profession of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.400" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.400" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">cool i didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:17.920" style="s2">yeah thank you greg that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">so notice what we now have we have the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.920" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">view is collapsing why is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:24.960" style="s2">aristotelian view collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:26.799" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t do well with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.960" end="00:57:27.920" style="s2">science at all it doesn&#39;t do well with</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.799" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">the emerging science</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">at all instead the science</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">is driving and this is not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.920" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">science is evil that is not what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that yeah i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">john and i are going to be in that camp</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">so but what the what the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:46.960" style="s2">revolution is doing it&#39;s revolting</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">against the erythrian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.960" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re losing right we&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">purpose and final causation</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">we&#39;re losing a picture of the mind as</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">functioning in development and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">emergence we&#39;re losing the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:02.559" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">being intimately connected to the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:05.680" style="s2">and that meaning</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">is uh something that all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.680" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">we find meaningful are disclosing uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.839" style="s2">aspects of the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">instead the mind is now a place where</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.839" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">all of the properties that can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">in matter have to be found so the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">of the rose</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">isn&#39;t anything out there because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">not a mathematical property it&#39;s just in</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">the sweetness of the honey the sunrise</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">and sunset are not there</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:29.599" style="s2">they&#39;re just subjective they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:33.440" style="s2">illusions</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:37.440" style="s2">right all of it is an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">and so you get this self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.440" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">mind that has a single</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:46.319" style="s2">basic function all it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">is trying to create mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">accurate representations of the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">and so the mind is basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:58:56.400" style="s2">struggling against the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">filled with</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2">all of these properties that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">belong in the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:03.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s trying to use mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.240" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.520" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">because that&#39;s the only way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">world can be present to it</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:10.319" style="s2">again right that&#39;s what a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">mind is trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.319" end="00:59:16.880" style="s2">exactly exactly okay so notice</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:19.760" style="s2">notice what what we&#39;re getting here so</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.880" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">this will allow us to introduce one</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.760" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">technical term we will try to keep these</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">to a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">so philosophers so galileo</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">proposes a distinction between sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:33.599" style="s2">primary and secondary qualities that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">descartes takes up</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:37.040" style="s2">and then lock takes up etc to get just</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">taken it</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:41.680" style="s2">so the primary qualities are the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">properties of things the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.680" end="00:59:44.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">that are mathematically measurable and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.720" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">they are objective they are in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">all the properties that are not</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:57.200" style="s2">mathematically measurable are secondary</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:59.440" style="s2">qualities and they only subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.200" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">exist they only exist in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.440" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">and now you have a place for all these</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:05.359" style="s2">secondary</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:06.880" style="s2">qualities so philosophers have a name</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">for these secondary qualities we call</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.880" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">them qualia</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.160" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">the qualia they&#39;re they&#39;re all of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">the the the felt meaningful aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:17.200" style="s2">our experience</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">that we don&#39;t think are actually in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.200" end="01:00:21.359" style="s2">world so we have the qualia</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:23.839" style="s2">and then of course we have a place for</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.359" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">the qualia and that place</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">we start to call consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">consciousness is the self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">place where the qualia are found and</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:34.119" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">purpose and development and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.119" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">self-actualization or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:44.559" style="s2">everything retreats there and and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">what you have is this notion</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.559" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">so let&#39;s i&#39;m going to come back to this</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:49.599" style="s2">in descartes second argument but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">the the notion</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.599" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">the mind was once in conformity to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:54.839" style="s2">world and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:00:57.520" style="s2">charles taylor calls this a contact</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.839" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">epistemology or so i keep using contact</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.520" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">what happens is the only thing that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">mind is now</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">in contact with is itself</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:06.640" style="s2">and that contact with itself are the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">qualia</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:11.119" style="s2">when the mind is touching itself those</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">are the purely subjective</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.119" end="01:01:16.079" style="s2">qualia that&#39;s consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">consciousness is the mind touching</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.079" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">itself in acts of qualia</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:22.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s how we started and notice how</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.400" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">completely subjective as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">and notice that it is something that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">by definition</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">not mathematically measurable and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">completely other than the external world</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">so descartes argument comes along and he</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:42.799" style="s2">looks at this and he says</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:44.240" style="s2">you know why that&#39;s the case people</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.799" end="01:01:45.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t think this was the case a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.240" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">years before descartes</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.359" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">but everybody&#39;s confronting these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">now descartes says you know why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">because mind and matter are actually two</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:55.359" style="s2">fundamentally different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">substance</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.359" end="01:01:59.359" style="s2">they share no properties they&#39;re unique</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:01.520" style="s2">and distinct from each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.359" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">and in comparison to the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:05.440" style="s2">worldview they can&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">all of this what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.440" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">scientific revolution descartes argument</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:12.000" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">perfect sense it explains why we are</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.000" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">coming to all of these conclusions about</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">and properties and how the earth is</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">actually going around the sun</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:22.480" style="s2">and that we there is no purpose out</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">there and the only thing the mind does</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.480" end="01:02:26.240" style="s2">is know the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">it explains all of this perfectly in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.240" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">way in which</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">the aristotelian framework does not</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:34.160" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one way in which his</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.160" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">is beating out the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.400" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">i want to put out one other there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">other contender</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">that is not normally talked about in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">official textbook okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:51.280" style="s2">and this is part of the history and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:52.720" style="s2">need to mention this because</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.280" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which greg and i want</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.720" end="01:02:57.520" style="s2">to bring back at least</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:59.440" style="s2">aspects of this contender into uh what</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.520" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.440" end="01:03:04.480" style="s2">so uh cedar talks about this and a</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">couple other people</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.480" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">mark taylor talks a lot about this in</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:09.599" style="s2">his book i believe after god</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">talks about that there was actually a</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.599" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">third contender uh that was actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">very prevalent</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">and this was the neoplatonic magical</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:18.960" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">uh that was coming out in the late</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.960" end="01:03:22.079" style="s2">renaissance</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">the fact that we even call it magic</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">means we&#39;ve already got this whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:27.599" style="s2">way in which we marginalized it and</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">excluded it</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.599" end="01:03:33.280" style="s2">uh and you know and so and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">rightly so like even when i when i utter</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.280" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">that word i sort of there&#39;s part of me</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">that goes</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:39.200" style="s2">right but let&#39;s let&#39;s try and situate it</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:41.520" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:42.839" style="s2">what were the neoplatonic uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.520" end="01:03:45.599" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.839" end="01:03:46.319" style="s2">magicians pointing to well they were</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.599" end="01:03:49.280" style="s2">pointing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.319" end="01:03:51.440" style="s2">things that didn&#39;t fit into either the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.280" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">aristotelian worldview or the new</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.440" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">cartesian worldview</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:57.440" style="s2">they were saying but wait there seems to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">be action at a distance</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">there seems to be magnetism and</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">why are things falling if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:05.119" style="s2">moving on purpose like aristotle said</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">descartes</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.119" end="01:04:10.480" style="s2">why when i like how does the earth</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">the earth is it touching the pen and yet</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.480" end="01:04:14.160" style="s2">it&#39;s drawn like what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">there&#39;s action out of the distance and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:16.240" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at living things and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.520" end="01:04:19.359" style="s2">they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.240" end="01:04:21.359" style="s2">but living things are self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.359" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">right they&#39;re self-they don&#39;t use that</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.359" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">term but that&#39;s right right</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">using terms that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">pointing to they&#39;re dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:29.440" style="s2">they&#39;re self-organizing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">inherently developmental using more</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.440" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">modern language they seem to have</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">emergent properties</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:36.000" style="s2">and so action at a distance and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">emergence and self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.000" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to say we need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:42.640" style="s2">make these the centerpiece</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:43.839" style="s2">if they had won biology would have been</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.640" end="01:04:46.880" style="s2">the first primary</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.839" end="01:04:49.440" style="s2">science other than physics right</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.880" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s only now that biology is coming</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">into its core</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">if you compare the sort of theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">advance</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:57.359" style="s2">in the two sciences biology is showing</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.680" end="01:04:58.480" style="s2">way more theoretical advance right now</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.359" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">than physics is</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.480" end="01:05:01.599" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t uh a coincidence by the</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.039" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.599" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that physics is bad or</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:06.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not generating all kinds of data</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about a very specific point</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.880" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">about theoretical advance</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s go back to the neoplatonus</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">they&#39;re saying all this</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:16.799" style="s2">and the catholic church is looking at</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">all this and it&#39;s like oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.799" end="01:05:20.079" style="s2">the aristotelian world war is collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:20.720" style="s2">but we&#39;re thomas and we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">lose that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.720" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">and initially descartes descartes is bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.039" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">this is not good</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:28.480" style="s2">galileo&#39;s bad galileo is almost like</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:31.440" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.480" end="01:05:32.400" style="s2">rest right but while as descartes is put</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.440" end="01:05:34.240" style="s2">on house duress</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">bruno is actually burnt at the stake and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.240" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">he&#39;s one of those neoplatons</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">now why why does the church regard</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.799" end="01:05:42.480" style="s2">fitness is even more dangerous well</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.480" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">if if if it&#39;s natural</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:48.880" style="s2">for there to be action at a distance</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.760" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.880" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">miracles aren&#39;t all that strange</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">everything has the potent and this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:05:59.520" style="s2">why they&#39;re thought of as being magical</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">everybody could potentially bring about</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.520" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">action at a distance</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">lifeless magnets bring about action and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">distance surely human beings could</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:10.000" style="s2">develop a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">magnetism as we&#39;re much later right</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.000" end="01:06:14.880" style="s2">and also they&#39;re miraculous and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">things are self-organizing and emergent</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.880" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">well you don&#39;t need a creator so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">don&#39;t need god the father</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:21.039" style="s2">and you don&#39;t need jesus in his miracles</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.039" end="01:06:26.880" style="s2">oh no whoa right</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:29.039" style="s2">that&#39;s really dangerous that&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.039" end="01:06:35.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you know what</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">let&#39;s actually embrace the cartesian</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.839" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">world of view</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.960" end="01:06:40.559" style="s2">with inertial motion and only efficient</p>

<p begin="01:06:40.559" end="01:06:44.160" style="s2">because it will it strangles out and</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.359" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">prevents</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.160" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.520" end="01:06:50.799" style="s2">no that&#39;s a i was talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.039" end="01:06:53.039" style="s2">psychological utility of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.799" end="01:06:55.200" style="s2">of the cartesian view you just added a</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.039" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2">whole another dimension of justification</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:06:58.480" style="s2">that i wasn&#39;t aware of in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.880" end="01:06:59.599" style="s2">to the pressures that would give rise to</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.480" end="01:07:01.280" style="s2">that fusion so now</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.599" end="01:07:02.880" style="s2">not only is it a psychological middle</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.280" end="01:07:04.240" style="s2">ground of science in</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.880" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">the old but it&#39;s actually now also a</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.240" end="01:07:09.599" style="s2">defense against a potential in</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:11.599" style="s2">incursion right excellent and so what</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">gets pushed to a side</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.599" end="01:07:19.200" style="s2">are organic dynamic emergent</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:20.079" style="s2">right embodied embedded approaches to</p>

<p begin="01:07:20.079" end="01:07:25.200" style="s2">that are only now very much later</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.440" end="01:07:27.520" style="s2">resurfacing in what&#39;s called 4e</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.200" end="01:07:30.799" style="s2">cognitive science it&#39;s taken that long</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.520" end="01:07:32.720" style="s2">and right to to to get back to where</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.799" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">we can now talk about the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.720" end="01:07:37.760" style="s2">things that the neoplatonists</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">wanted to talk about and so what happens</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.760" end="01:07:40.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">a large part of the catholic church</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.559" end="01:07:44.480" style="s2">aligns and this is what</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">what i i was trying what greg was</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.480" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">alluding to about</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">why the catholic church aligns</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:52.079" style="s2">with descartes because by aligning with</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:55.520" style="s2">the cartesian</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.079" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">framework it can actually especially one</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.520" end="01:07:59.440" style="s2">that&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">all of the uh the uh approval of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:04.319" style="s2">emerging scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:05.599" style="s2">then it can have a ball work against</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.319" end="01:08:09.599" style="s2">this other view</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.599" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">that is much more dangerous uh to</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.599" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">the the catholic worldview the christian</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:17.199" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">and descartes dualism as greg rightly</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.199" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">alluded</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.319" end="01:08:22.000" style="s2">gives you a way of re-conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:24.839" style="s2">and now we</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.000" end="01:08:27.199" style="s2">we take it for granted but</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.839" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">reconceptualizing the soul</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:30.640" style="s2">and what descartes does is he says well</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">you know this this completely</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.640" end="01:08:34.640" style="s2">self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">mental stuff that is completely not</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:37.199" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what a soul is a soul is</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.199" end="01:08:40.239" style="s2">completely self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">mental stuff aristotle would have said</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.239" end="01:08:42.640" style="s2">what are you talking about that makes no</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:46.640" style="s2">sense to me</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:49.520" style="s2">right you know and so what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.640" end="01:08:50.640" style="s2">you get something that we all now take</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.520" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">for granted</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.640" end="01:08:56.960" style="s2">you get the equation of soul</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">with the conscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.960" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">that that&#39;s what the soul is and that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:04.319" style="s2">and then the conscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:07.279" style="s2">is equated with a self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.319" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">separable immaterial substance and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.279" end="01:09:10.319" style="s2">the catholic church has a new way of</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">thinking about soul</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">that gives keeps it independent from</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:19.679" style="s2">independent from being crushed away by</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.679" end="01:09:23.839" style="s2">now i want to be clear i am not accusing</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.159" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">descartes of</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.839" end="01:09:27.440" style="s2">engaging in propaganda because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">trying to save the catholic church</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.440" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">descartes is a catholic but his</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.319" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">arguments</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:34.640" style="s2">are they have to be taken on their own</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:35.359" style="s2">merits because they were taken on their</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.640" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">own marriage</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.359" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">but what i am saying is the reverse is</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">the case there&#39;s a huge branch of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">catholic church</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:44.560" style="s2">that actually gets attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:46.839" style="s2">descartes ideas because it squeezes out</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.560" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">the neoclateness with scientific</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.839" end="01:09:51.600" style="s2">legitimacy</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.080" end="01:09:52.960" style="s2">and it gives a reconceptualization of</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.600" end="01:09:55.920" style="s2">the soul</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">that will preserve it from the emerging</p>

<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:01.440" style="s2">of the aristotelian worldview</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.520" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:12.320" style="s2">in a way that is almost</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:16.080" style="s2">imperceptibly complex this</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.320" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">idea of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.080" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">is bound up via these right via this</p>

<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">descartes wins because his argument</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.199" end="01:10:29.760" style="s2">functions best</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:31.920" style="s2">to get rid of the aristotelian right</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.760" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">out the neil plaitness and rehome the</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:38.080" style="s2">right so it&#39;s just insinuated</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.920" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">throughout it&#39;s woven through the</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:47.520" style="s2">and the now emerging christian worldview</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.760" end="01:10:50.159" style="s2">the new the the post descartes</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.520" end="01:10:51.600" style="s2">christian world view and so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.159" end="01:10:53.040" style="s2">seeing here is the intersection between</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.600" end="01:10:54.159" style="s2">these large-scale systems of</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.040" end="01:10:57.280" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.159" end="01:10:58.920" style="s2">that are institutionalized and narrating</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.280" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">their structures right at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.920" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">sociocultural level</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">as we try to narrate what is going on at</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:06.960" style="s2">this human psychological level</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">you know at the subjective the interface</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.960" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">between all of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">is why we got a world knot of</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:14.800" style="s2">consciousness you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:17.120" style="s2">so i i think we&#39;re getting to a place</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.800" end="01:11:20.239" style="s2">maybe where we can start to wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.120" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">uh this uh portion of the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.239" end="01:11:23.760" style="s2">yeah so i think that&#39;s what we should do</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:25.440" style="s2">but uh so you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.760" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">we we&#39;ve taken the title of this from</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.440" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">schopenhauer&#39;s quote that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:30.560" style="s2">mind body problem is the world not</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">and we chose the world not precisely</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.560" end="01:11:33.440" style="s2">because we</p>

<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:38.719" style="s2">about sort of you know here&#39;s some</p>

<p begin="01:11:52.320" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter that has has been sewn</p>

<p begin="01:11:58.000" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to show you is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.320" end="01:12:04.400" style="s2">cartesian model</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:06.400" style="s2">of consciousness is born up with those</p>

<p begin="01:12:08.560" end="01:12:10.960" style="s2">inseparable fashion and then you say</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.080" end="01:12:13.840" style="s2">well that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.960" end="01:12:15.600" style="s2">i like the dualism no well i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.840" end="01:12:17.120" style="s2">leave you with why it&#39;s problematic and</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.600" end="01:12:18.719" style="s2">then next time greg and i will come back</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.120" end="01:12:20.480" style="s2">and look at david&#39;s second argument</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.719" end="01:12:22.560" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna keep doing this here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.480" end="01:12:24.560" style="s2">it&#39;s problematic and descartes knew this</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.560" end="01:12:26.800" style="s2">and everybody immediately said staycard</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.560" end="01:12:28.159" style="s2">knew it and they they saw it as the deep</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">the deepest problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.159" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">so everybody says yes descartes must be</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">right for all the reasons we&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:39.600" style="s2">but how is it possible that</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:42.159" style="s2">mind or consciousness and matter</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.600" end="01:12:43.199" style="s2">interact because the whole point of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.159" end="01:12:44.800" style="s2">is dualism</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.199" end="01:12:46.640" style="s2">the whole point is they share no</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.800" end="01:12:49.679" style="s2">properties whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.640" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">how could the truth of my idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.679" end="01:12:55.600" style="s2">in any way affect the</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:56.800" style="s2">matter of my body my bad my body has to</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.600" end="01:12:59.360" style="s2">be moved by some other</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.800" end="01:13:00.640" style="s2">matter that has physical energy it has</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.360" end="01:13:03.520" style="s2">inertial properties</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.640" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">that has electromagnetic radiation my</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.520" end="01:13:07.920" style="s2">ideas and the truth of my idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">of none of those properties but yet i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.920" end="01:13:10.640" style="s2">going to do it i want to move my finger</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.520" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">hey there you go</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.640" end="01:13:14.800" style="s2">it moved how did mine move matter or the</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:16.719" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.800" end="01:13:18.400" style="s2">so i had my hand on the table at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.719" end="01:13:20.239" style="s2">completely material contact</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.400" end="01:13:22.719" style="s2">galileo&#39;s right things smashing into</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.239" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">each other but it results in</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.719" end="01:13:28.800" style="s2">pain which is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:32.159" style="s2">completely subjective</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.800" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">qualia how did something</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.159" end="01:13:38.480" style="s2">physical caught an objective</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.360" end="01:13:41.840" style="s2">and energetic cause pain</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.480" end="01:13:43.920" style="s2">which is subjective and not</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.840" end="01:13:46.560" style="s2">and so this is this is what&#39;s known as</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.920" end="01:13:48.239" style="s2">the mind-body problem we can even call</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.560" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">it the consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.239" end="01:13:51.280" style="s2">world problem or the consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.320" end="01:13:53.920" style="s2">matter problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.280" end="01:13:54.800" style="s2">right that&#39;s to me yep and and do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.920" end="01:13:57.040" style="s2">remember the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.800" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">duchess or lady because over descartes</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.040" end="01:14:01.600" style="s2">overlooks this in his first</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">round of this and he gets it pointed out</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:05.040" style="s2">to him and i&#39;m blanking on her name i</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2">think it&#39;s elizabeth from sweden who</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.040" end="01:14:07.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:09.840" style="s2">okay anyway so she asked them this very</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.920" end="01:14:12.840" style="s2">question of course and this gets to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.840" end="01:14:13.760" style="s2">pineal gland answer which is not</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.840" end="01:14:16.880" style="s2">adequate back to this</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.760" end="01:14:18.880" style="s2">right so and everybody takes it up</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:19.440" style="s2">spinoza takes it up and lives and it</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.880" end="01:14:21.840" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.440" end="01:14:22.719" style="s2">leibnitz takes it up and mall branch</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.840" end="01:14:24.800" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.719" end="01:14:26.239" style="s2">and and you can there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.800" end="01:14:28.880" style="s2">this is the problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.239" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">that everybody we can&#39;t ignore this</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.880" end="01:14:33.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:35.840" style="s2">because the solution that descartes</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.040" end="01:14:35.840" style="s2">proposed</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.000" end="01:14:40.400" style="s2">while elegant in its ability to deal</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:42.719" style="s2">with the scientific world view</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.400" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2">and the christian worldview and hold</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.719" end="01:14:45.600" style="s2">them together</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.600" end="01:14:48.000" style="s2">and give people an existential response</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.600" end="01:14:50.320" style="s2">to all of the trauma that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.000" end="01:14:51.520" style="s2">well it&#39;s elegant in all of those ways</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.320" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">gives us this</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.520" end="01:14:55.520" style="s2">like what seems like an insolvable</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:57.520" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.520" end="01:14:58.800" style="s2">there seems to be no possible way in</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.520" end="01:15:01.600" style="s2">which mind</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.800" end="01:15:03.120" style="s2">and matter can interact and yet</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.600" end="01:15:05.600" style="s2">everything about us</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.120" end="01:15:07.120" style="s2">tells us everything we&#39;re doing every</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.600" end="01:15:09.600" style="s2">moment of our experience</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.120" end="01:15:11.120" style="s2">every knowledge claim we make everything</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.600" end="01:15:14.320" style="s2">what i claim to know greg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.120" end="01:15:15.840" style="s2">knowledge i came to know greg&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.320" end="01:15:18.080" style="s2">i just claim to have knowledge of it but</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.840" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">all i see is his material body</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.080" end="01:15:21.600" style="s2">how could i possibly go from his</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">material body to his mind</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.600" end="01:15:26.000" style="s2">it can&#39;t causally interact so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:26.800" style="s2">going to come back to this in the way in</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.000" end="01:15:29.199" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.800" end="01:15:30.960" style="s2">the mind-body problem is also a problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.199" end="01:15:33.120" style="s2">of other minds</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.960" end="01:15:34.000" style="s2">no reason for attributing mind to</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.120" end="01:15:36.560" style="s2">anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.000" end="01:15:38.719" style="s2">because the only way mind can be known</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.560" end="01:15:41.679" style="s2">is consciousness of itself</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.719" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">and for all my affection for greg i do</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.679" end="01:15:45.360" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:48.080" style="s2">know his mind that way that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.360" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">yep right and so so here we have the</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.080" end="01:15:51.120" style="s2">knot</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.480" end="01:15:53.040" style="s2">the knot has been tied uh but we can</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.120" end="01:15:53.920" style="s2">leave little clues here if we go back</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.040" end="01:15:55.920" style="s2">and we say okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.920" end="01:15:57.360" style="s2">if you remember our first thing we i put</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.920" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">up that sort of okay we&#39;re going to work</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:02.719" style="s2">through this mind right mind123</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:04.719" style="s2">we have we can identify with aristotle</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.719" end="01:16:05.600" style="s2">and the functional conformity we can see</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.719" end="01:16:08.239" style="s2">a functional</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.600" end="01:16:10.080" style="s2">active mind kind of notion you know it</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.239" end="01:16:12.719" style="s2">starts with plants and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.080" end="01:16:14.000" style="s2">dogs do it and then people do it okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.719" end="01:16:15.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to be actually going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.000" end="01:16:18.480" style="s2">connect to our mind one</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.920" end="01:16:20.560" style="s2">version of reality and then we have also</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.480" end="01:16:23.040" style="s2">connected this notion about this</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.560" end="01:16:24.239" style="s2">narrative and institutional</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.040" end="01:16:26.239" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.239" end="01:16:27.440" style="s2">and argument okay which is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.239" end="01:16:29.840" style="s2">mind three</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.440" end="01:16:31.520" style="s2">and now we&#39;re really honing in on what</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.840" end="01:16:32.320" style="s2">what we&#39;re meaning in our western</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.520" end="01:16:35.080" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.320" end="01:16:37.199" style="s2">this contained subjective</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.080" end="01:16:38.400" style="s2">representational phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.199" end="01:16:40.640" style="s2">portion</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.400" end="01:16:42.000" style="s2">of mind uh and then that becomes</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.640" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">consciousness and then how does that</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.000" end="01:16:45.600" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:46.719" style="s2">uh is you know where you know these are</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.600" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">two domains we&#39;re gonna give a</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.719" end="01:16:48.880" style="s2">vocabulary to them but we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:52.320" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.880" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">with this problem so but we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.320" end="01:16:55.199" style="s2">try and shrink it as much as we can</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:56.560" style="s2">we&#39;re going to shrink that thing and</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.199" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">we&#39;re going to box it in and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.560" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">to show</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:00.239" style="s2">that with additional language categories</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.000" end="01:17:03.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.239" end="01:17:04.960" style="s2">an upgraded version of uh scientific</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:08.560" style="s2">ontology and epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.960" end="01:17:12.000" style="s2">this thing can be much more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.560" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">addressed yes and that again will ramify</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.000" end="01:17:14.800" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.719" end="01:17:16.159" style="s2">in terms of the existential and</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.800" end="01:17:18.480" style="s2">spiritual consequences</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.159" end="01:17:20.560" style="s2">it will actually feed back in important</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.480" end="01:17:23.199" style="s2">ways to addressing the media crisis</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.560" end="01:17:24.159" style="s2">absolutely okay so uh we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.199" end="01:17:26.719" style="s2">meet again</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.159" end="01:17:28.239" style="s2">um and greg and i are we&#39;ve both</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.719" end="01:17:29.760" style="s2">committed to this long term</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.239" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">because we both think the journey has</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.760" end="01:17:34.239" style="s2">been engaged</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">yeah and so next time what i want to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.239" end="01:17:36.560" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:38.159" style="s2">uh present uh the sec we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:39.280" style="s2">take a look at danger&#39;s three arguments</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:40.320" style="s2">because the three arguments are</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.280" end="01:17:41.840" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.320" end="01:17:43.360" style="s2">um and we&#39;ll go through that and then</p>
